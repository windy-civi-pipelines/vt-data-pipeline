No. R-120. House concurrent resolution congratulating the Thetford Academy
Panthers Division III boys’ basketball team on their second consecutive
championship.
(H.C.R.96)
Offered by Representatives Holcombe of Norwich and Masland of Thetford
Whereas, the height and prowess of the Thetford Academy basketball squad were
vividly on display at the 2025 Division III championship game played at the Barre
Auditorium, in which the second-seeded Panthers met the fifth-seeded Hazen Union
Wildcats, and
Whereas, Thetford powerfully dominated the on-court action from the opening tipoff
until the final moment of competition, and
Whereas, at one point in the second quarter, the Panthers, who maintained the lead
throughout the contest, held an overwhelming 28–7 scoring advantage over the Wildcats,
and although the Wildcats were able to reduce the enormity of the Thetford lead, the final
result was never in doubt as the Panthers (21–3) departed for home with the Division III
crown and a solid 58–44 victory, and
Whereas, Panthers Matthew Vivian, Liam Murphy, Dempsey McGovern, Hunter
Clay, Braxton Adams, William Phelps, Dillon Vance, Liam Brooks, Tommy Amber, Sam
Parkman, Matthew McGovern, Spencer Durkee, and Connor Sloop proved their
championship credentials, and
Whereas, Head Coach Jason Gray and assistant coaches Alex Emerson, Andy Martin,
and Owen Deffner were ideal advisers throughout the 2024–2025 season, now
therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the Thetford Academy Panthers Division III
boys’ basketball team on their second consecutive championship, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Thetford Academy
