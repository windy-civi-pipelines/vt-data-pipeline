Section 1:
State of Vermont
House of Representatives
Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 96
House concurrent resolution congratulating the Thetford Academy Panthers
Division III boys’ basketball team on their second consecutive championship
Whereas, the height and prowess of the Thetford Academy basketball squad
were vividly on display at the 2025 Division III championship game played at
the Barre Auditorium, in which the second-seeded Panthers met the fifth-
seeded Hazen Union Wildcats, and
Whereas, Thetford powerfully dominated the on-court action from the
opening tipoff until the final moment of competition, and
Whereas, at one point in the second quarter, the Panthers, who maintained
the lead throughout the contest, held an overwhelming 28–7 scoring advantage
over the Wildcats, and although the Wildcats were able to reduce the enormity
of the Thetford lead, the final result was never in doubt as the Panthers (21–3)
departed for home with the Division III crown and a solid 58–44 victory, and
Whereas, Panthers Matthew Vivian, Liam Murphy, Dempsey McGovern,
Hunter Clay, Braxton Adams, William Phelps, Dillon Vance, Liam Brooks,
Tommy Amber, Sam Parkman, Matthew McGovern, Spencer Durkee, and
Connor Sloop proved their championship credentials, and
Whereas, Head Coach Jason Gray and assistant coaches AlexEmerson,
Andy Martin, and Owen Deffner were ideal advisers throughout the 2024–
2025 season, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the Thetford Academy Panthers
Division III boys’ basketball team on their second consecutive championship,
and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this
resolution to Thetford Academy
