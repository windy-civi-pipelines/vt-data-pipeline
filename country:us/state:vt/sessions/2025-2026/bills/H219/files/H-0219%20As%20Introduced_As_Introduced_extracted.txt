1 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
2 Sec. 1. FINDINGS AND INTENT
3 (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds that:
4 (1) Approximately 6,000 children in Vermont have an incarcerated
5 parent or guardian annually, with a significant majority unable to maintain
6 meaningful family connections due to a lack of correctional facility
7 programming.
8 (2) Research demonstrates that comprehensive family programs,
9 including opportunities for child-friendly visitation, assists with reducing
10 recidivism, enhancing community reintegration, and promoting child well-
11 being.
12 (3) The Department of Corrections collaborates with a local nonprofit to
13 provide incarcerated female parents and guardians at the Chittenden Regional
14 Correctional Center with a trauma-informed, comprehensive approach to
15 strengthen family connections that minimizes the adverse effects of parental
16 incarceration and fosters better outcomes for parents and children.
17 (4) While Vermont incarcerates a higher percentage of parents and
18 guardians compared to the national average and provides family-friendly
19 support services for incarcerated female parents and guardians, no comparable
20 program exists for incarcerated males, which leaves a critical gap in family
21 support services.

1 (5) Expanding family support services and programming to incarcerated
2 male parents and guardians may yield societal benefits by preserving family
3 connections and mitigating the trauma of incarceration on parents, guardians,
4 children alike.
5 (b) Intent.
6 (1) It is the intent of the General Assembly that the Department of
7 Corrections ensures gender parity in the access to services and programs that
8 strengthen family connections.
9 (2) It is the further intent of the General Assembly that the Department
10 of Corrections develop a phased plan to expand the application of 28 V.S.A.
11 § 128 to all Vermont correctional facilities by 2028.
12 Sec. 2. 28 V.S.A. § 102(c) is amended to read:
13 (c) The Commissioner is charged with the following responsibilities:
14 * * *
15 (24) To include funding to sufficiently provide and sustain trauma-
16 informed family support services and programming pursuant to section 128 of
