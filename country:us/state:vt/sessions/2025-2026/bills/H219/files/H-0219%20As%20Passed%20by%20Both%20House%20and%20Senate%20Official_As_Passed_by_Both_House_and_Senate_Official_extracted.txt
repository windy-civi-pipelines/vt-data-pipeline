1 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
2 Sec. 1. FINDINGS AND INTENT
3 (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds that:
4 (1) Approximately 6,000 children in Vermont have an incarcerated
5 parent or guardian annually, with a significant majority unable to maintain
6 meaningful family connections due to a lack of correctional facility
7 programming.
8 (2) Research demonstrates that comprehensive family programs,
9 including opportunities for child-friendly visitation, assists with reducing
10 recidivism, enhancing community reintegration, and promoting child well-
11 being.
12 (3) The Department of Corrections collaborates with a local nonprofit to
13 provide incarcerated female parents and guardians at the Chittenden Regional
14 Correctional Center with a trauma-informed, comprehensive approach to
15 strengthen family connections that minimizes the adverse effects of parental
16 incarceration and fosters better outcomes for parents and children.
17 (4) While Vermont incarcerates a higher percentage of parents and
18 guardians compared to the national average and provides family-friendly
19 support services for incarcerated female parents and guardians, no comparable
20 program exists for incarcerated males, which leaves a critical gap in family
21 support services.

2025 Page 3 of 9
1 (5) Expanding family support services and programming to incarcerated
2 male parents and guardians may yield societal benefits by preserving family
3 connections and mitigating the trauma of incarceration on parents, guardians,
4 children alike.
5 (b) Intent.
6 (1) It is the intent of the General Assembly that the Department of
7 Corrections ensures gender parity in the access to services and programs that
8 strengthen family connections.
9 (2) It is the further intent of the General Assembly that the Department
10 of Corrections develop a phased plan to expand the application of 28 V.S.A.
11 § 128 to all Vermont correctional facilities by 2028.
12 Sec. 2. 28 V.S.A. § 102(c) is amended to read:
13 (c) The Commissioner is charged with the following responsibilities:
14 * * *
15 (24) To include funding to sufficiently provide and sustain trauma-
16 informed family support services and programming pursuant to section 128 of
17 this title in the Department’s annual proposed budget for the next subsequent
18 fiscal year for the purposes of developing the State budget required to be
