is intended to provide a general summary of the act and may not be exhaustive. It has been prepared by the
staff of the Office of Legislative Counsel without input from members of the General Assembly. It is not
intended to aid in the interpretation of legislation or to serve as a source of legislative intent.
Act No. 61 (S.45). An act relating to protection from nuisance suits for agricultural
activities
Subjects: Court procedure; agriculture; right-to-farm; nuisance suits; agricultural
activities
This act amends the right-to-farm protection from nuisance suits provided to farmers.
The act adds a new definition of “generally accepted agricultural practices” to which
nuisance protection would apply. “Generally accepted agricultural practices” are defined
to mean the State water quality requirements for farms, if applicable; the requirements of
Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation permits, if applicable; the requirements of the
State’s Rule for Control of Pesticides; and practices conducted in a manner consistent
with proper and accepted customs and standards followed by similar operators of
agricultural activities in the State.
The act amends the standards that provide farms with protection from nuisance suits.
The act provides that no agricultural activity shall be or become a nuisance when the
activity is conducted in accordance with generally accepted agricultural practices.
However, the act provides that a farmer must be in good standing with the Agency of
Agriculture, Food and Markets and the Agency of Natural Resources in order to assert
nuisance protection. Good standing can be shown by letters from the Secretaries of the
agencies.
The act also clearly states that the plaintiff shall have the burden of proof by the
preponderance of the evidence to show that a farmer is not entitled to nuisance protection
and is a nuisance. In addition, a farmer shall not receive nuisance protection if the
nuisance violation results from the negligent operation of an agricultural activity; the
agricultural activity has a substantial adverse effect on health, safety, or welfare based
upon objective, documented medical or scientific evidence that the agricultural activity
was the proximate cause of the alleged effect; or a reasonable person would find that the
agricultural activity was a proximate cause of a noxious and significant interference with
the use and enjoyment of the neighboring property.
The act provides that the right to farm law protection from nuisance is to be liberally
construed by courts to effectuate its purpose of protecting reasonable agricultural
activities from lawsuits. The act also provides that a person shall not bring a court action
based on a claim of nuisance arising from an agricultural activity unless the person and
the farmer, at least once, attempt to resolve the issue through mediation.
