It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
Sec. 1. 12 V.S.A. chapter 195 is amended to read:
CHAPTER 195. NUISANCE SUITS AGAINST AGRICULTURAL
ACTIVITIES

Section 2:
§ 5751. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE
The General Assembly finds that agricultural production is a major
contributor to the State’s economy; that agricultural lands constitute unique
and irreplaceable resources of statewide importance; that the continuation of
existing and the initiation of new agricultural activities preserve the landscape
and environmental resources of the State, contribute to the increase of tourism,
and further the economic welfare and self-sufficiency of the people of the
State; and that the encouragement, development, improvement, and
preservation of agriculture will result in a general benefit to the health and
welfare of the people of the State. In order for the agricultural industry to
survive in this State, farms will likely change, adopt new technologies, and
diversify into new products, which for some farms will mean increasing in
size. The General Assembly finds that agricultural activities are potentially
subject to lawsuits based on the theory of nuisance, and that these suits
encourage and could force the premature removal of the farmlands and other
farm resources from agricultural use. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect
VT LEG #384278 v.1
No. 61 Page 2 of 7
2025
reasonable agricultural activities conducted on the farm from nuisance
lawsuits.

enjoyment of the neighboring property.
