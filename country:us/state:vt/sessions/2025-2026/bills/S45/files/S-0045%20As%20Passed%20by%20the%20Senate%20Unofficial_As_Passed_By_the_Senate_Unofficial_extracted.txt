3 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
4 Sec. 1. 12 V.S.A. chapter 195 is amended to read:
5 CHAPTER 195. NUISANCE SUITS AGAINST AGRICULTURAL
6 ACTIVITIES
7 § 5751. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE
8 The General Assembly finds that agricultural production is a major
9 contributor to the State’s economy; that agricultural lands constitute unique
10 and irreplaceable resources of statewide importance; that the continuation of
11 existing and the initiation of new agricultural activities preserve the landscape
12 and environmental resources of the State, contribute to the increase of tourism,
13 and further the economic welfare and self-sufficiency of the people of the
14 State; and that the encouragement, development, improvement, and
15 preservation of agriculture will result in a general benefit to the health and
16 welfare of the people of the State. In order for the agricultural industry to
17 survive in this State, farms will likely change, adopt new technologies, and
18 diversify into new products, which for some farms will mean increasing in
19 size. The General Assembly finds that agricultural activities are potentially
20 subject to lawsuits based on the theory of nuisance, and that these suits
21 encourage and could force the premature removal of the farmlands and other
VT LEG #381873 v.1
