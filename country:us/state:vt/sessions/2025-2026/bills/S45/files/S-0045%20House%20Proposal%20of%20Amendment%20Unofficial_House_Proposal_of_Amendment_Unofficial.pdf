1 S.45
2 An act relating to protection from nuisance suits for agricultural activities
3 The House proposes to the Senate to amend the bill by striking out all after
4 the enacting clause and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
5 Sec. 1. 12 V.S.A. chapter 195 is amended to read:
6 CHAPTER 195. NUISANCE SUITS AGAINST AGRICULTURAL
7 ACTIVITIES
8 § 5751. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE
9 The General Assembly finds that agricultural production is a major
10 contributor to the State’s economy; that agricultural lands constitute unique
11 and irreplaceable resources of statewide importance; that the continuation of
12 existing and the initiation of new agricultural activities preserve the landscape
13 and environmental resources of the State, contribute to the increase of tourism,
14 and further the economic welfare and self-sufficiency of the people of the
15 State; and that the encouragement, development, improvement, and
16 preservation of agriculture will result in a general benefit to the health and
17 welfare of the people of the State. In order for the agricultural industry to
18 survive in this State, farms will likely change, adopt new technologies, and
19 diversify into new products, which for some farms will mean increasing in
20 size. The General Assembly finds that agricultural activities are potentially
21 subject to lawsuits based on the theory of nuisance, and that these suits
