8 Subject: Court procedure; agriculture; nuisance suits; agricultural activities;
9 right-to-farm
10 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to amend the
11 protection against nuisance suits for agricultural activities under the Vermont
12 right-to-farm law by providing that an agricultural activity shall not be a
13 nuisance or trespass when the activity complies with generally accepted
14 agricultural practices. The nuisance and trespass protection for an agricultural
15 activity would not apply whenever a nuisance or trespass violation results from
16 the negligent operation of an agricultural activity or from a violation of the
17 State agricultural water quality requirements. The bill would also provide that
18 an agricultural activity shall not lose nuisance or trespass protection due to a
19 change of ownership or a cessation of operation of not more than five years; a
20 change of crops produced; or a change of a farming method or conversion of a
21 farming practice or agricultural activity to another farming method, practice,

1 or agricultural activity on a farm. The act would also provide that a person
2 shall not bring a court action based on a claim of nuisance or trespass arising
3 from an agricultural activity unless the person and the operator of the
4 agricultural activity, at least once, attempt to resolve through mediation the
5 issue or dispute that the person has concerning operation of the agricultural
6 activity.
7 An act relating to protection from nuisance suits for agricultural activities
8 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
9 Sec. 1. 12 V.S.A. chapter 195 is amended to read:
10 CHAPTER 195. NUISANCE SUITS AGAINST AGRICULTURAL
11 ACTIVITIES
12 § 5751. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE
13 The General Assembly finds that agricultural production is a major
14 contributor to the State’s economy; that agricultural lands constitute unique
15 and irreplaceable resources of statewide importance; that the continuation of
16 existing and the initiation of new agricultural activities preserve the landscape
17 and environmental resources of the State, contribute to the increase of tourism,
18 and further the economic welfare and self-sufficiency of the people of the
19 State; and that the encouragement, development, improvement, and

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.45
2025 Page 3 of 7
1 preservation of agriculture will result in a general benefit to the health and
2 welfare of the people of the State. In order for the agricultural industry to
3 survive in this State, farms will likely change, adopt new technologies, and
4 diversify into new products, which for some farms will mean increasing in
5 size. The General Assembly finds that agricultural activities are potentially
6 subject to lawsuits based on the theory of nuisance, and that these suits
7 encourage and could force the premature removal of the farmlands and other
8 farm resources from agricultural use. It is the purpose of this chapter to
9 protect reasonable agricultural activities conducted on the farm from nuisance
10 lawsuits.
11 § 5752. DEFINITIONS
12 For the purpose of As used in this chapter,:
