5 Date:
6 Subject: Agriculture; dairy; milk pricing; tiered pricing system; over order
7 price enhancement
8 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to implement
9 measures to revitalize the Vermont dairy industry. The bill would establish a
10 tiered system to set an equitable minimum price that milk handlers shall pay to
11 milk producers for milk processed and manufactured within the State. The
12 tiered pricing shall be based on milk producers’ cost of production, including
13 the costs of environmental compliance unique to Vermont milk producers. If
14 market pricing under the Federal Milk Market Order 1 does not sufficiently
15 cover the costs of production, the bill would require an over order price
16 enhancement to be paid to Vermont milk producers. To ensure that the tiered
17 pricing does not generate incentives to over produce, the bill would establish
18 production tiers for small, medium, and large farms. In addition, to fund the
19 tiered pricing system and the over order enhancements, a per gallon handling
20 fee would be assessed on packaged milk sold in the State. The amount of the
21 handling fee would be adjusted based on the market price paid to milk
