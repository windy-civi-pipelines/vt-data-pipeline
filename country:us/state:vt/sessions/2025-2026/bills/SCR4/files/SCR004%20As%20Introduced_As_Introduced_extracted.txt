S.C.R. 4. Senate concurrent resolution recognizing the success of the American System of Conservation
Funding and commemorating the 75th anniversary of the enactment of federal sport fish restoration
legislation.
Whereas, the administrative and financial structure that supports natural resource conservation efforts in the
United States is often referred to as the American System of Conservation Funding, and the original source of
its funds was the states’ assessment of fees for recreational sporting licenses, and
Whereas, beyond those fees, the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration (Pittman-Robertson) Act, chapter 899,
50 Stat. 917 (1937), as amended, and the Sport Fish Restoration (Federal Aid in Fish Restoration) (Fish
Restoration and Projects (Dingell-Johnson)) Act, chapter 658, 64 Stat. 430 (1950), as amended, established
new federal conservation funding, and
Whereas, these respective acts allocate funds from federal excise tax revenue on hunting equipment to
finance wildlife natural resource restoration projects, and on revenue from excise taxes on sport fishing
equipment and from tariffs imposed on fishing tackles and boating equipment for fishing restoration
support, and
Whereas, among the fishing-related state beneficiaries are land acquisition and shelter construction costs,
and in our region, the New England Fishery Resources Restoration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-593, an
amendment to the 1950 Sport Fish Restoration Act, provided for a study for the “timely and effective
implementation of restoration plans and programs for Atlantic salmon and other fishery resources of selected
river systems in New England,” and the development of “an inventory of important fish and wildlife habitat
and other natural areas of river basins in New England,” now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly recognizes the success of the American System of Conservation Funding and
commemorates the 75th anniversary of the enactment of federal sport fish restoration legislation, and be it
further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the Vermont
Commissioner of Fish and Wildlife, to the Director of the Office of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and to
the Vermont Congressional Delegation.
