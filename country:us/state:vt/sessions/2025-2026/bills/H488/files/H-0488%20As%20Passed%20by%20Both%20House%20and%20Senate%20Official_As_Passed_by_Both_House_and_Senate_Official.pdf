cost for the approved grants shall increase over the prior fiscal year’s
minimum total estimated State share cost by the same percentage as the
appropriation for State aid for town highway structures is increased pursuant
to subdivision (1) of this subsection.
(4) In a given fiscal year, should expenditures in the Town Highway
Structures Program exceed the amount appropriated, the Agency shall advise
the Governor of the need to request a supplemental appropriation from the
General Assembly to fund the additional project cost, provided that the Agency
has previously committed to completing those projects.

minimum total estimated State share cost by the same percentage as the
appropriation for the Class 2 Town Highway Roadway Program is increased
pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection.
(4) In a given fiscal year, should expenditures in the Class 2 Town
Highway Roadway Program exceed the amount appropriated, the Agency shall
advise the Governor of the need to request a supplemental appropriation from
the General Assembly to fund the additional project cost, provided that the
Agency has previously committed to completing those projects. Funds received
as grants for State aid under the Class 2 Town Highway Roadway Program
may be used by a municipality to satisfy a portion of the matching
