Sec. 1a. FISCALYEAR 2026 TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS
INTENDED TO REDUCE TRANSPORTATION-RELATED
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, REDUCE FOSSILFUEL
USE, AND SAVE VERMONT HOUSEHOLDS MONEY
This act includes the State’s fiscal year 2026 transportation investments
intended to reduce transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions, reduce
fossil fuel use, and save Vermont households money in furtherance of the
policies articulated in 19 V.S.A. § 10b and the goals of the Comprehensive
Energy Plan and the Vermont Climate Action Plan and to satisfy the Executive
and Legislative Branches’ commitments to the Paris Agreement climate goals.
In fiscal year 2026, these efforts will include the following:
(1) Park and Ride Program. This act provides for a fiscal year
expenditure of $2,435,740.00, which will fund two construction projects to
create new park-and-ride facilities, the construction of improvements to two
existing park-and-ride facilities, funding for a municipal park-and-ride grant
program, and paving projects for existing park-and-ride facilities. This year’s
Park and Ride Program will create 60 new State-owned spaces. Specific
additions and improvements include:
(A) Manchester—construction of 50 new spaces; and
(B) Sharon—design and construction of 10 new spaces.
(2) Bike and Pedestrian Facilities Program. This act provides for a
fiscal year expenditure, including local match, of $21,879,965.00, which will
fund 33 bike and pedestrian construction projects; 17 bike and pedestrian
design, right-of-way, or design and right-of way projects for construction in

(B) a small-scale municipal bicycle and pedestrian grant program for
projects to be selected during the fiscal year;
(C) projects funded through the Safe Routes to School Program; and
(D) community grants along the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail (LVRT).
(3) Transportation Alternatives Program. This act provides for a fiscal
year expenditure of $6,471,054.00, including local funds, which will fund 17
transportation alternatives construction projects; 26 transportation alternatives
design, right-of-way, or design and right-of-way projects; and eight scoping
studies. Of these 51 projects, 20 involve environmental mitigation related to

(b) Upon becoming aware of a significant change in State revenues or a
reduction in federal funding, rescission of federal grants, or delay of
anticipated federal funding that will impact the Agency’s ability to carry out

significant portions of the fiscal year 2026 Transportation Program, the
Secretary of Transportation may request that the Joint Transportation

fiscal year 2026 Transportation Program that is in excess of four percent, the
Secretary shall submit to the Joint Transportation Oversight Committee a
written report detailing the impact of the decrease on projects that are in the
2026 Transportation Program.

cost for the approved grants shall increase over the prior fiscal year’s
minimum total estimated State share cost by the same percentage as the
appropriation for State aid for town highway structures is increased pursuant to
subdivision (1) of this subsection.
(4) In a given fiscal year, should expenditures in the Town Highway
Structures Program exceed the amount appropriated, the Agency shall advise

(B) in the case of a terminating event, by multiplying the mileage-
based user fee rate by the vehicle miles traveled between the last Vermont
annual inspection and the terminating event; or
(C) in the absence of a recorded odometer reading during the mileage
reporting period, by multiplying the mileage-based user fee by the 98th
percentile of estimated annual vehicle miles traveled for a pleasure car in
Vermont.
(4) “Mileage-based user fee rate” means the per-mile usage fee charged
to the owner or lessee of a BEV registered in Vermont.
(5) “Mileage reporting period” means the time between annual

reporting period.
Sec. 19. INTENT
