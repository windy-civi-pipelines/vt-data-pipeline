Senate Concurrent Resolution
Offered By Senators Weeks, Collamore, Williams, Baruth, Bongartz, Chittenden, Clarkson, Douglass,
Gulick, Hardy, Hashim, Ingalls, Lyons, Major, Norris, Perchlik, and Watson,
Offered By All Members of the House,
S.C.R. 2. Senate concurrent resolution honoring the Vermont Old Cemetery Association.
Whereas, the first known established cemeteries in Vermont are now into their third century serving as
a dignified final abode for the deceased, and
Whereas, in 1958, University of Vermont Professor Leon Dean formalized his passion for the State’s
earliest established cemeteries when he established the Vermont Old Cemetery Association (VOCA), and
Whereas, VOCA offers specific cemetery assistance in the form of financial grants, volunteer labor,
and site guidance, and more broadly, the organization educates the public on the centrality of Vermont’s
long-enduring cemeteries, and
Whereas, the awarding of direct monetary support to local cemetery associations and municipalities
began in 1974, with a modest $25.00 donation to the Town of Halifax, and since then, the organization
has issued over $60,000.00 in financial grants for the restoration of old cemeteries, and
Whereas, hundreds of old Vermont cemeteries have benefited from VOCA’s volunteer guidance and
restoration services that bring a new beauty and serenity to these cemeteries, and these grants save local
cemetery associations and municipalities expenses that might otherwise not be affordable, and
Whereas, VOCA is especially focused on the dignity of veterans’ burials through spearheading the
enactment of laws ensuring their respectful interment, replacing damaged monuments, and establishing
new ones for those veterans who were never properly honored, and
Whereas, as a publisher, VOCA’s informative quarterly newsletter presents preservation advice and
cemetery law updates; the organization’s book, Burial Grounds of Vermont, is a comprehensive resource
for the history and status of most Vermont cemeteries; and its school course guide, Stones and Bones, is a
great resource for incorporating our State’s old cemeteries into a school’s Vermont history
curriculum, and
Whereas, VOCA has served as a model for similar cemetery restoration initiatives in other states, now
therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly honors the Vermont Old Cemetery Association, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the Vermont Old
Cemetery Association.
