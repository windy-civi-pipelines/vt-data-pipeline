17 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to implement
18 Green Mountain Care, a publicly financed health care program for all Vermont

1 Health Care Advisory Group at the Green Mountain Care Board to provide
2 recommendations to the General Assembly regarding the sequencing of and
3 financing for the health care services to be added in the third through 10th
4 years of Green Mountain Care’s implementation. The bill would also express
5 legislative intent regarding funding sources for Green Mountain Care and
6 would prohibit health insurance plans and rates from reflecting duplication of
7 the coverage provided by Green Mountain Care.
8 An act relating to incremental implementation of Green Mountain Care
9 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
10 Sec. 1. PURPOSE
11 The purpose of this act is to initiate the incremental implementation of
12 Green Mountain Care by starting to provide comprehensive, affordable, high-
13 quality, publicly financed health care for all Vermonters in accordance with the
14 principles established in 2011 Acts and Resolves No. 48. The act gradually
15 expands the benefits available through Green Mountain Care over 10 years,
16 beginning with publicly financed primary care in the first year, adding
17 preventive dental and vision care in the second year, and adding the remaining
18 health care services according to a schedule recommended by the Green
19 Mountain Care Board’s Universal Health Care Advisory Group. It is the intent
20 of the General Assembly that, by the 10th year, the Green Mountain Care

1 her the determination, the Commissioner shall consider whether a policy form,
2 premium rate, or rule is affordable; does not duplicate coverage provided by
3 Green Mountain Care; and is not unjust, unfair, inequitable, misleading, or
4 contrary to the laws of this State; and, for a policy form for major medical
5 insurance coverage, whether it ensures equal access to appropriate mental
6 health care in a manner equivalent to other aspects of health care as part of an
7 integrated, holistic system of care. The Commissioner shall make his or her
8 the determination within 30 days after the date the insurer filed the policy
9 form, premium rate, or rule with the Department. At the expiration of the 30-
10 day period, the form, premium rate, or rule shall be deemed approved unless
11 prior to then it has been affirmatively approved or disapproved by the
12 Commissioner or found to be incomplete. The Commissioner shall notify an
13 insurer in writing if the insurer files any form, premium rate, or rule containing
14 a provision that does not meet the standards expressed in this subsection. In
15 such notice, the Commissioner shall state that a hearing will be granted within
16 20 days upon the insurer’s written request.
