has sparked worldwide conversations, and
Whereas, the efforts of Team Trumie reflect a profound desire to create a world where
disability and differences are not hidden but embraced, and
Whereas, Truman and his family have actively engaged with their local community
through their presence at public venues, established an initiative to improve support for
