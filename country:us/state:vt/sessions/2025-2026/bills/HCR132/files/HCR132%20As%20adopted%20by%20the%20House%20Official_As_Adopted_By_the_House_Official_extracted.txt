House of Representatives
Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 132
Offered by Senators Collamore, Weeks, and Williams
House concurrent resolution congratulating the West Rutland High School Golden Horde girls’
basketball team on winning a fourth consecutive Division IV championship
Whereas, over the last four seasons, the on-court expertise and precision of the Golden Horde has
greatly impressed the team’s opponents, and
Whereas, as the Division IV titleholder in 2022, 2023, and 2024, West Rutland, with a roster
featuring the all-time scorer in Vermont girls’ high school basketball, was eager to extend this
championship streak in 2025, and
Whereas, in the 2025 championship game, played at the Barre Auditorium, the top-seeded Golden
Horde were matched against the second-ranked Long Trail School Mountain Lions, and
Whereas, the game’s only mystery was the exact final score, as West Rutland commanded the
scoreboard throughout, expanding a 21–6 halftime lead into a 46–21 victory, and
Whereas, the truly extraordinary Golden Horde basketball mavens were Peyton Guay, Isabella
Coombs, Kennah Wright-Chapman, Aubrey Beaulieu, Camryn Williams, Maggie Therrien, Hayley
Raiche, Bradee Traverse, Isabella Griffith, Myra Rocke, Brianna Gallipo, and Emma Haley, and
Whereas, Head Coach Carl Serrani; Assistant Coach Matt Serrani; student managers Kylie Duel,
Jaquira Earley, and Sadie McGee; and Athletic Trainer Zach Royer each contributed to the great 2024–
2025 Golden Horde season, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the West Rutland High School Golden Horde girls’
basketball team on winning a fourth consecutive Division IV championship, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to West Rutland
