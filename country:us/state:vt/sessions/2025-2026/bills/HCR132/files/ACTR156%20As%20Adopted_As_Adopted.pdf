Whereas, over the last four seasons, the on-court expertise and precision of the Golden
Horde has greatly impressed the team’s opponents, and
Whereas, as the Division IV titleholder in 2022, 2023, and 2024, West Rutland, with a
roster featuring the all-time scorer in Vermont girls’ high school basketball, was eager to
extend this championship streak in 2025, and
Whereas, in the 2025 championship game, played at the Barre Auditorium, the top-
seeded Golden Horde were matched against the second-ranked Long Trail School
Mountain Lions, and
Whereas, the game’s only mystery was the exact final score, as West Rutland
commanded the scoreboard throughout, expanding a 21–6 halftime lead into a 46–21
victory, and
Whereas, the truly extraordinary Golden Horde basketball mavens were Peyton Guay,
Isabella Coombs, Kennah Wright-Chapman, Aubrey Beaulieu, Camryn Williams,
Maggie Therrien, Hayley Raiche, Bradee Traverse, Isabella Griffith, Myra Rocke,
Brianna Gallipo, and Emma Haley, and
Whereas, Head Coach Carl Serrani; Assistant Coach Matt Serrani; student managers
Kylie Duel, Jaquira Earley, and Sadie McGee; and Athletic Trainer Zach Royer each
contributed to the great 2024–2025 Golden Horde season, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the West Rutland High School Golden
Horde girls’ basketball team on winning a fourth consecutive Division IV championship,
and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
West Rutland High School.
