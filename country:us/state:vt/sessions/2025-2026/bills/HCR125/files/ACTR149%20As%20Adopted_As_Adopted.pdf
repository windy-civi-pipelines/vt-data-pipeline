Whereas, garlic is a vegetable that may be described as a stinking rose, but for
30 years, its strong and distinctive aroma has annually launched a grand festival, and
Whereas, the origin of this combined agricultural, artistic, culinary, and musical
extravaganza, which attracts attendees from near and far, dates from 1995, when a small
farmers market, known as the Southern Vermont Garlic and Herb Festival, was
established in Wilmington, and
Whereas, this homage to all things garlic rapidly expanded in popularity, and in 2008,
the Bennington Area Chamber of Commerce, since rebranded as the Southwestern
Vermont Chamber of Commerce, brought the event to Bennington, and
Whereas, by 2019, under the devoted leadership and careful curation of festival chair
Lindy Lynch, this annual gathering had expanded 260 percent, with 16,000 attendees, and
it was honored as one of the world’s top 10 garlic festivals, and
Whereas, following a brief pandemic-necessitated pause, this stellar Bennington
County observance was rebranded as Garlic Town U.S.A.; switched to a new site in
downtown Bennington; and this year, as a one-day celebration, will be broadened in
scope to showcase “new energy, vendors, and experiences,” while still saluting the
wonders of garlic, and
Whereas, Garlic Town U.S.A. has exciting plans for the festival’s 2025 rendition on
August 30, with the intent to accommodate 130 vendors, including garlic growers,
artisans, and specialty food producers; to offer a vibrant downtown atmosphere; to
provide interactive children’s activities; to station food trucks to nourish hungry
appetites; and, importantly, to limit the day’s environmental impact with a broad
commitment to a zero-waste initiative, and
Whereas, the continuing success of Garlic Town U.S.A. is the result of the festival’s
enthusiastic organizers, supporters, and volunteers, and especially its superb current
manager, Mikaela Lewis, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly commemorates the 30th anniversary of Garlic Town
U.S.A., a celebration of “flavor, community, and tradition,” and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the Southwestern Vermont Chamber of Commerce.
