14 (d) Administration.
15 (1) The Commissioner may operate, or may operate through a third-
16 party administrator, a verification system for mobile identifications.
17 (2) Access to the verification system and any data field by a person
18 presented with a mobile identification requires the credential mobile
19 identification holder’s consent, and, if consent is granted, the Commissioner
20 may release the following through the verification system:
VT LEG #380622 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.360
2025 Page 4 of 9
1 (A) for a full profile, all data fields that appear on the mobile
2 identification; and
3 (B) for a limited profile, only the data fields represented in the
4 limited profile for appearing on the mobile identification that the mobile
5 identification holder has consented to have released.
6 (3) The Commissioner shall ensure that any verification system for
7 mobile identifications meets the following requirements:
8 (A) The verification system does not incentivize or require a person
9 using the verification system to take possession of a mobile identification
10 holder’s device while accessing data from the mobile identification.
11 (B) The verification system does not share or retain any information
12 regarding the persons that have accessed data from a particular mobile
13 identification or the locations at which data from a particular mobile
14 identification has been accessed.
15 (C) The verification system requires attribute authentication or
16 selective disclosure in all instances when access to a full profile is not
17 reasonably necessary. The verification system shall ensure that the data fields
18 being requested are first disclosed to the mobile identification holder and that
19 the mobile identification holder may determine which data fields are released
20 to the person requesting the data.
VT LEG #380622 v.1

8 which mobile identifications are stored;
9 (ii) procedures for requesting and accessing data from mobile
10 identifications through the verification system;

13 identification holder’s consent to the disclosure of data fields on the mobile
14 identification; and
15 (iv) requirements providing for the storage of information
16 regarding what data was requested and accessed from a mobile identification,
17 which shall only be available to the mobile identification holder and may be
18 retained or destroyed at the mobile identification holder’s discretion.
19 (B) The standards, to the extent practicable, shall be based on widely
20 accepted and publicly available national or international standards.
