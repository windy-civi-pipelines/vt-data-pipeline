1 (b) There is established the Vermont State and Judiciary Employees’
2 Cost-Savings Incentive Program. The Program shall provide financial

4 result in financial savings for any Executive agency, department, board,

12 obligations.
13 (d) Within 60 days following the receipt of a suggestion, the agency,

5 and the suggestion is implemented.

7 administrative unit of the State or the Judiciary that receives a suggestion, shall

11 or employees making the suggestion, the Department of Human Resources,

2 employee, the award shall be divided equally among the employees who

5 be computed on the actual savings for a 12-month period, with the period to
6 run from the time that the suggestion is fully implemented. An award made
7 pursuant to this section shall be paid out of funds appropriated to the agency,
8 department, board, bureau, commission, or other administrative unit of the
9 State or the Judiciary that realizes the cost savings and shall be paid to the
10 employee within one year and 30 days following full implementation of the
11 suggestion. An award shall not be included when calculating an employee’s
12 average final compensation for determining the employee’s retirement
13 allowance.

15 terminates State service prior to full implementation of the employee’s
16 suggestion, the employee shall be entitled to receive the full award.
17 (i)(1) If the agency, department, board, bureau, commission, or other

14 Employees’ Association, Inc., appointed by the Association’s Executive
15 Director, and three members from the Judiciary, appointed by the Court
16 Administrator.

1 (j) If an employee believes that the Executive agency, department, board,

4 suggestion, the employee may submit a written request to the State Auditor or
5 the Court Administrator, as appropriate, that explains the employee’s objection
6 to the amount awarded in writing within 30 days following the award. The
7 State Auditor or the Court Administrator shall review the amount awarded and
