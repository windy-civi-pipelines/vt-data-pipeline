12 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
13 Sec. 1. SHORT TITLE
14 This act may be cited as the “Extreme Temperature Worker Protection Act.”
15 Sec. 2. 21 V.S.A. chapter 3, subchapter 5A is added to read:
16 Subchapter 5A. Extreme Temperature Worker Protection
17 § 240. PURPOSE
18 (a) Thousands of workers become sick from occupational exposure to
19 extreme hot and cold temperatures each year, many of whom die.
VT LEG #382538 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.153
2025 Page 2 of 18
1 (b) Nearly three out of four workers who die from exposure to extreme
2 temperatures in the workplace die in the first week of their employment before
3 they have had an opportunity to acclimatize to the conditions.
4 (c) Employers are required to provide workplaces free of known health and
5 safety hazards, and this includes protecting employees from temperature-
6 related hazards.
7 § 240a. DEFINITIONS
8 As used in this subchapter:
9 (1) “Acclimatization” means the body’s adaption to work in the heat as
10 a person is exposed to heat gradually over time, which reduces the strain
11 caused by heat stress and enables a person to work with less chance of heat
12 illness or injury.
13 (2) “Ambient temperature” means the temperature of the air surrounding
14 a body.
15 (3) “Cold-related injuries and illnesses” include chilblains, frostbite,
16 trench foot, and hypothermia. Symptoms of chilblains include redness,
17 itching, blistering, inflammation, and possible ulceration in severe cases.
18 Symptoms of frostbite include numbness, tingling or stinging, aching, and
19 bluish or pale, waxy skin. Symptoms of trench foot include reddening of the
20 skin, numbness, leg cramps, swelling, tingling pain, blisters or ulcers, bleeding
21 under the skin, and discoloration of the foot due to gangrene. Early symptoms
VT LEG #382538 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.153

1 of hypothermia include shivering, fatigue, loss of coordination, confusion, and
2 disorientation. Late symptoms of hypothermia include no shivering, blue skin,
3 dilated pupils, slowed pulse and breathing, and loss of consciousness.
4 (4) “Employee” means any person engaged in service to an employer for
5 wages, salary, or other compensation, as well as individuals employed on the
6 worksite through a staffing agency, contractor, subcontractor, or delivery
7 service.
8 (5) “Employer” means a natural person, corporation, partnership, trust,
9 society, club, association, or other organization, including municipalities, the
10 State, and its instrumentalities.
11 (6) “Heat-related injuries and illnesses” include heat cramps, heat
12 exhaustion, heat syncope, and heat stroke.
13 (7) “Indoor” and “indoors” mean an area under a ceiling or overhead
14 covering that restricts airflow and has along its entire perimeter walls, doors,
15 windows, dividers, or other physical barriers that restrict airflow, whether open
16 or closed.
17 (8) “Outdoor” and “outdoors” mean an area that is not indoors.
18 (9) “Signs and symptoms of a heat emergency” include loss of
19 consciousness with excessive body temperature, which may or may not be
20 accompanied by vertigo, nausea, headache, cerebral dysfunction, or bizarre
21 behavior. A heat emergency could also include staggering, vomiting, acting

2025 Page 4 of 18
1 irrationally or disoriented, having convulsions, and continuing to have an
2 elevated heart rate despite resting.
3 (10) “Signs and symptoms of heat-related illness” include headache,
4 nausea, weakness, dizziness, elevated body temperature, muscle cramps, and
5 muscle pain or spasms.
6 (11) “Wet bulb globe temperature” means a heat metric that considers
7 ambient temperature, humidity, radiant heat from sunlight or artificial heat
8 sources, and air movement.
9 (12) “Work vehicle” means a car, truck, van, or other authorized means
10 of transporting vehicles or goods.
11 § 240b. APPLICATION

1 (5) The employer must encourage employees to request preventative
2 cool-down breaks of not less than 10 minutes as needed. Employees who take
3 preventative cool-down breaks shall be monitored for symptoms of heat illness
4 and a heat emergency. If an employee exhibits signs or symptoms of heat-
5 related illness or a heat emergency, the employer shall provide appropriate first
6 aid or emergency response. Employees shall be encouraged to remain in the

18 employees new to the worksite and employees returning to the worksite
19 following an absence from work of more than 14 days. New and returning
20 employees shall be closely observed for signs and symptoms of heat-related
21 illness.

2 increases the duration of work so that the employee’s exposure to temperatures
3 above 80 degrees Fahrenheit is restricted to not more than:
4 (i) 20 percent of a normal work shift exposure duration on the first
5 day;

14 (ii) 60 percent on the second day of work; and
15 (iii) 80 percent on the third day of work.
16 (b) When the wet bulb globe temperature at a worksite exceeds 90 degrees
17 Fahrenheit, in addition to the steps required by subsection (a) of this section,
18 the employer must provide employees with at least a 15-minute paid rest break

2025 Page 10 of 18
1 (c) When the wet bulb globe temperature at a worksite exceeds 100 degrees
2 Fahrenheit, in addition to the steps required by subsection (a) of this section,
3 the employer must provide employees with at least a 10-minute paid rest break
4 every hour in the cool-down break area. If the rest period coincides with an
5 unpaid meal break, the rest period will be considered a compensable work
6 assignment.
7 (d) Employees taking a preventative cool-down break pursuant to
8 subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be closely observed for signs and
9 symptoms of heat-related illness or a heat emergency by one of the following
10 methods:
11 (1) a mandatory buddy system in which co-workers observe each other;
12 (2) observation by a supervisor or designated observer, with not more
13 than 20 employees observed by one individual; or
14 (3) effective two-way communication with employees who work alone
15 at a worksite with contact occurring at least every two hours.
16 (e) On days when the wet bulb globe temperature at a worksite is forecast

7 § 240e. COLD INJURY AND ILLNESS PREVENTION
8 (a) The following steps shall be taken when the temperature at a worksite
9 falls below 60 degrees Fahrenheit:
10 (1) The employer must provide an effective means of communication so
11 that employees can contact a supervisor when necessary to address concerns
12 about temperature-related working conditions and signs and symptoms of cold-
13 related injuries and illness.
14 (2) The employer must provide access to potable water for drinking that
15 is:
16 (A) placed in locations readily accessible to the employee;

10 illness and risk factors for cold stress. Risk factors for cold stress include wet
11 or damp clothing, inadequate clothing, and exhaustion. If an employee
12 exhibits signs or symptoms of cold-related illness, the employer shall provide
13 appropriate first aid or emergency response. Employees shall be encouraged to
14 remain in the warm-up area until any signs or symptoms of cold-related illness
15 have abated. If the preventative rest period coincides with an unpaid meal
16 break, the rest period will be considered a compensable work assignment.
17 (5) Employers must provide work vehicles with functioning heating that

5 (2) The employer must provide suitable personal protective equipment
6 to the employee to protect the employee’s ears, face, hands, and feet. If the
7 employee’s skin, clothing, or personal protective equipment is wet, the
8 employee must be immediately removed from the worksite, taken to a warm-
9 up area, and not return to the worksite until the wet items have dried or been
10 replaced. In considering the necessary protective equipment, employers must
11 take into account the risk factors for an employee’s heat load when wearing
12 personal protective equipment in cold temperatures.
13 (c) Employees taking a warm-up break pursuant to subsection (b) of this
14 section shall be closely observed for signs and symptoms of cold-related illness
15 and risk factors for cold stress by one of the following methods:

9 up area, and not return to the worksite until the wet items have dried or been
10 replaced. In considering the necessary protective equipment, employers must
11 take into account the risk factors for an employee’s heat load when wearing
12 personal protective equipment in cold temperatures.
13 (c) Employees taking a warm-up break pursuant to subsection (b) of this
