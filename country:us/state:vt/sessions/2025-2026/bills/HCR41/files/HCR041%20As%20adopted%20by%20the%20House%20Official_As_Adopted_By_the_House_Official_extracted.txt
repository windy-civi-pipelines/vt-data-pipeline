Section 1:
State of Vermont
House of Representatives
Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 41
Milton
Offered by Senator Brennan
House concurrent resolution congratulating Keeler’s Bay Variety Store of South Hero on the
50th anniversary of the Horne family’s ownership
Whereas, the story of Keeler’s Bay Variety Store (KBV) is intimately intertwined with the
lives of Gail and Mark Horne, who, in 1974, took a leisurely drive across the Champlain Islands
and discovered a small grocery store in South Hero, which they subsequently purchased, and
Whereas, under their visionary leadership, KBV evolved into a full-service general store,
featuring a bakery, a beer cave stocked with craft beers, the largest 802Spirits store in the
Champlain Islands, an in-store butchery, and motor vehicle gasoline sales, and this friendly
community retailer earned a reputation for superb customer service, and
Whereas, at the 2000 Vermont Grocers’ Association Convention, KBV was honored as the
Grocer of the Year and, separately, the Lake Champlain Islands Economic Development
Corporation awarded KBV its 2017 Business of the Year designation, and
Whereas, on Saturday, September 21, 2024, KBV and the Horne family marked their joint
50th-anniversary milestone with a unique version of the store’s annual Customer Appreciation
Day, and in celebration, a variety of commemorative memorabilia was offered for sale, and
Whereas, KBV has a proud association with community support service groups and
contributes to local nonprofit organizations, and
Whereas, the store, whose ownership team now includes the Horne’s daughter, Wendy, has
earned the moniker, “The Heart of the Island,” which was also the name of a limited edition
semicentennial ale that the Kraemer & Kin Brewery created to celebrate this special anniversary,
now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates Keeler’s Bay Variety Store of South Hero on the
50th anniversary of the Horne family’s ownership, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to KBV.
