Whereas, food shelves, food pantries, meal sites, senior meal programs, the Vermont
Foodbank, emergency shelters, Area Agencies on Aging, community groups, businesses, health
providers, statewide coalitions, faith-based organizations, and concerned and dedicated
individuals are working to end hunger in Vermont, and
Whereas, a major support for this effort is 3SquaresVT, the federal Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program (SNAP) in Vermont that the Department for Children and Families’
Economic Services Division administers, and
Whereas, 3SquaresVT is an extremely effective and efficient antihunger program providing
nine meals for every one meal that the charitable food system offers, and
Whereas, more than 65,000 Vermonters, comprising nearly 40,000 households of all ages and
demographics, are recipients of 3SquaresVT benefits, and
Whereas, a large segment of 3SquaresVT recipients are children, seniors, or people living
with disabilities, and
Whereas, 3SquaresVT serves the food needs of friends, neighbors, and families with privacy
and dignity and mitigates the impact of poverty on our most vulnerable residents, and
Whereas, this federal program strengthens the economic vitality of Vermont’s local
communities and businesses, such as grocers and farmers, and our State economy, by keeping
redeemed benefits from each meal within our State, and
Whereas, the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows that the
number of people at risk of hunger is only increasing, particularly households with children, now
therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly designates February 6, 2025 as 3SquaresVT Awareness Day at the
State House.
