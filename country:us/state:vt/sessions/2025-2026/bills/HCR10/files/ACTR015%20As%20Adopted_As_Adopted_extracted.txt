Foodbank, emergency shelters, Area Agencies on Aging, community groups, businesses,

dedicated individuals are working to end hunger in Vermont, and

ages and demographics, are recipients of 3SquaresVT benefits, and

residents, and
Whereas, this federal program strengthens the economic vitality of Vermont’s local
communities and businesses, such as grocers and farmers, and our State economy, by
keeping redeemed benefits from each meal within our State, and
Whereas, the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows that the
number of people at risk of hunger is only increasing, particularly households with
