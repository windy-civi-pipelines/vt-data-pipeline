3 business. The Attorney General shall, at least once every two years, review
4 and update these rules as necessary to keep pace with emerging technology.
5 § 2449g. AGE ASSURANCE PRIVACY
6 (a) Privacy protections for age assurance data. Covered businesses and
7 processors shall:
8 (1) only collect personal data of a user that is strictly necessary for age
9 assurance;
10 (2) immediately upon determining whether a user is a covered minor,
11 delete any personal data collected of that user for age assurance, except
12 whether the user is or is not determined to be a covered minor;
13 (3) not use any personal data of a user collected for age assurance for
14 any other purpose;
15 (4) not combine personal data of a user collected for age assurance with
16 any other personal data of the user, except whether the user is or is not
17 determined to be a covered minor; and
18 (5) implement a review process to allow users to appeal their age
19 designation.
20 (b) Rulemaking.
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.69
2025 Page 23 of 25
1 (1) Subject to subdivision (2) of this subsection, the Attorney General
2 shall, on or before July 1, 2027, adopt rules identifying commercially
3 reasonable and technically feasible methods for covered businesses and
4 processors to determine if a user is a covered minor, describing appropriate
5 review processes for users appealing their age designations, and providing any
6 additional privacy protections for age assurance data. The Attorney General
7 shall periodically review and update these rules as necessary to keep pace with
8 emerging technology.
9 (2) In adopting these rules, the Attorney General shall:
10 (A) prioritize user privacy and accessibility over the accuracy of age
11 assurance methods; and
12 (B) consider:
13 (i) the size, financial resources, and technical capabilities of
14 covered businesses and processors;
15 (ii) the costs and effectiveness of available age assurance methods;
16 (iii) the impact of age assurance methods on users’ safety, utility,
17 and experience;
18 (iv) whether and to what extent transparency measures would
19 increase consumer trust in an age assurance method; and
20 (v) the efficacy of requiring covered businesses and processors to:
21 (I) use previously collected data to determine user age;
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.69
2025 Page 24 of 25
1 (II) adopt interoperable age assurance methods; and
2 (III) provide users with multiple options for age assurance.
3 § 2449h. ENFORCEMENT
4 (a) A covered business or processor that violates this subchapter or rules
5 adopted pursuant to this subchapter commits an unfair and deceptive act in
6 commerce in violation of section 2453 of this title.
7 (b) The Attorney General shall have the same authority under this
8 subchapter to make rules, conduct civil investigations, bring civil actions,
9 and enter into assurances of discontinuance as provided under chapter 63 of
10 this title.
11 § 2449i. LIMITATIONS
12 Nothing in this subchapter shall be interpreted or construed to:
13 (1) impose liability in a manner that is inconsistent with 47 U.S.C.
14 § 230; or
15 (2) prevent or preclude any covered minor from deliberately or
16 independently searching for, or specifically requesting, any media.
17 § 2449j. RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF COVERED MINORS
18 It is the intent of the General Assembly that nothing in this subchapter may
19 be construed to infringe on the existing rights and freedoms of covered minors
20 or be construed to discriminate against the covered minors based on race,
