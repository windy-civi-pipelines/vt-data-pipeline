when its digital products are used by minors. The act requires covered businesses to have
the default privacy setting of its digital products set to the highest level of privacy when
used by a minor. The act prohibits the collection or sharing of the personal data of a
minor unless otherwise necessary to provide a certain service to the minor. It also
restricts the ability of a covered business to permit an individual to monitor the activity or
location of a minor on its digital product without providing a conspicuous signal to the
minor.
Finally, the Attorney General is granted rulemaking authority to further define what
design practices might lead to compulsive use of a digital product and to provide covered
businesses with privacy-minded methods to estimate the age of its users.
