AS PASSED BY SENATE S.69

11 (iii) the impact of age assurance methods on users’ safety, utility,
12 and experience;
13 (iv) whether and to what extent transparency measures would
14 increase consumer trust in an age assurance method; and
15 (v) the efficacy of requiring covered businesses and processors to:
16 (I) use previously collected data to determine user age;
