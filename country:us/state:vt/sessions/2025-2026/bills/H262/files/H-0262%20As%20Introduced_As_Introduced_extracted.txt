7 learning, statistics, data processing, or artificial intelligence.
8 (3) “Automated decision system output” means information, data,
9 assumptions, predictions, scoring, recommendations, decisions, or conclusions
10 generated by an automated decision system.
11 (4) “Data” means information obtained by any means that, directly or
12 indirectly, identifies, relates to, describes, may reasonably be associated with,
13 or could reasonably be linked to an employee, including:
14 (A) personal identifying information;
15 (B) biometric information;

1 (5) “Electronic monitoring” means the collection of information
2 concerning employee activities or communication by any means other than
3 direct, in-person observation, including through the use of a digital device;
4 computer; telephone; wire; radio; camera; or electromagnetic, photoelectronic,
5 or photo-optical system.
6 (6) “Employee” means an individual who in consideration of direct or
7 indirect gain or profit is employed by an employer. As used in this section,
8 “employee” includes job applicants and independent contractors providing
9 services, directly or indirectly, to an employer.
10 (7) “Employer” means a person who directly or indirectly employs or
11 exercises control over the wages, benefits, other compensation, hours, working
12 conditions, access to work or job opportunities, or other terms and conditions
13 of employment of an employee. For purposes of this section, “employer”
14 includes the employer’s agents, labor contractors, or other affiliates or
15 subcontractors through which individuals perform work on behalf of the
16 employer or otherwise provide services that are integrated into the employer’s
17 business operations.
18 (8) “Employment-related decision” means any decision made by an
19 employer that:
20 (A) affects an employee’s compensation, benefits, or terms and

8 spends performing a function, the terms of any applicable collective bargaining
9 agreement, the employee’s past and present work experiences, and the
10 employee’s performance in the position. The employer’s reasonable,
11 nondiscriminatory judgment as to which job functions are essential may be
12 relevant evidence but not the sole basis for a determination as to which
13 functions are essential, the determination of which requires consideration of
14 objective evidence.
