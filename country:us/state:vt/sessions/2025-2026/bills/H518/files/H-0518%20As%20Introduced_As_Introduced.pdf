7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to repeal the
8 State Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program (Program). The Agency of
9 Natural Resources would not be required to establish and implement the
10 Program. Similarly, the bill would repeal the requirement that the State
11 Treasurer conduct an assessment of the cost to the State of Vermont and its
12 residents of the emission of covered greenhouse gasses during the specified
13 covered period. In addition, any State position authorized for the Program or
14 for the State Treasurerâ€™s completion of the assessment would be terminated,
15 and any funds appropriated to the Agency of Natural Resources or the State
16 Treasurer for implementation or administration of the Program would be
17 returned to the General Fund or any other fund from which monies were
18 appropriated.
