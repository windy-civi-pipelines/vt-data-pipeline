Whereas, without any discrimination, all Vermonters are entitled to receive the highest
attainable quality of health care, including mental health care, and
Whereas, 1997 Acts and Resolves No. 25, Sec. 2, codified as 8 V.S.A. § 4089b,
established that the treatment of an individual’s mental health must be on par with that
person’s physical health care, and
Whereas, mental health care must be provided in a manner that does not result in any
form of stigma, prejudice, violence, social exclusion, segregation, or unnecessary
institutionalization, and
Whereas, all mental health treatment practices should respect an individual’s
autonomy, dignity, personal preferences, and will, and they must not constitute or lead to
violations and abuses of human rights or fundamental freedoms, and
Whereas, mental health support and related community services should integrate a
human rights perspective in order to avoid harm to any individuals availing themselves of
these services, and
Whereas, today, January 29, 2025, individuals are visiting the State House seeking to
remind the General Assembly of the fundamental importance of providing Vermonters
with mental health care that equals in every respect the quality of care provided to
individuals with any other health conditions, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly designates January 29, 2025 as Mental Health Advocacy
Day at the State House, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the mental health advocacy organizations present today in the State House.
