Whereas, 1997 Acts and Resolves No. 25, Sec. 2, codified as 8 V.S.A. § 4089b, established that the

Whereas, mental health care must be provided in a manner that does not result in any form of stigma,
prejudice, violence, social exclusion, segregation, or unnecessary institutionalization, and
Whereas, all mental health treatment practices should respect an individual’s autonomy, dignity,
personal preferences, and will, and they must not constitute or lead to violations and abuses of human
rights or fundamental freedoms, and

perspective in order to avoid harm to any individuals availing themselves of these services, and
Whereas, today, January 29, 2025, individuals are visiting the State House seeking to remind the

That the General Assembly designates January 29, 2025 as Mental Health Advocacy Day at the State
House, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the mental
