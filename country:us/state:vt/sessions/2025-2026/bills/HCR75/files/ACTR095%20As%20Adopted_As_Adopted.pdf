No. R-95. House concurrent resolution congratulating the 2025 Essex High School
Hornets girls’ gymnastics team on winning a second consecutive State championship.
(H.C.R.75)
Offered by Representatives Dodge of Essex, Black of Essex, Dolan of Essex Junction,
Garofano of Essex, Houghton of Essex Junction, and Steady of Milton
Whereas, with fresh memories of their 2024 State title and many returning team
members competing in the current season, the Hornets savored the potential of a repeat
performance, and
Whereas, an unusual complication on the day of the State championship meet, held at
Champlain Valley Union High School, occurred when Head Coach Mary Savage was
absent giving birth to her first child, a baby boy, requiring Assistant Coach Anna
Charland to assume responsibility for supporting the Essex gymnasts, and
Whereas, the Hornets strove to honor their coach with a victory and earned the top
team score in the bars, floor, and beam events, enabling them to clinch the 2025 crown by
defeating second-place St. Johnsbury Academy 141.850 to 135.800, and
Whereas, talented athletes Jocelyn Bourget, Sarai Crowley, Jill Diehl, Leah Frisbie,
Riley Hammond, Anna Kinney, Maybel Lyon-Home, Emerson Marckres, and Rachel
Mitchell were delighted to honor their coach on this special day for both the team and
her, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2025 Essex High School Hornets girls’
gymnastics team on winning a second consecutive State championship, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Essex High School.
