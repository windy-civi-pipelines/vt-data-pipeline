Mentoring Day at the State House
Whereas, now more than ever, youth need supportive and committed
mentors in their lives, who see, hear, and champion them, and
Whereas, caring and committed mentors offer support for youth, providing
them a consistent friend, helping to ignite a young person’s curiosities,
solidifying their passions, and leveraging their talents, and
Whereas, mentored youths exhibit improved resiliency and better
relationships with peers, family, schools, and community, and
Whereas, 96 percent of mentored youths agree or strongly agree that “my
mentor makes me feel like I matter,” and 92 percent agree or strongly agree
that “having a mentor has made a positive difference in my life,” and
Whereas, mentoring relationships provide individualized attention and
support, which were primary components of personal rebounding from the
pandemic, and
Whereas, Vermont mentoring agencies, including MENTOR Vermont and
other public and private organizations throughout the State, are committed to
working collaboratively to empower youth, advance the Vermont mentoring
field, and broaden the reach of mentoring relationships in our communities,
now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly designates February 13, 2025 as Youth
Mentoring Day at the State House, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this
resolution to MENTOR Vermont.
