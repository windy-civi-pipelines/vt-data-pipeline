No. R-28. House concurrent resolution designating February 13, 2025 as Youth
Mentoring Day at the State House.
(H.C.R.23)
Offered by Representative Cordes of Bristol
Whereas, now more than ever, youth need supportive and committed mentors in their
lives, who see, hear, and champion them, and
Whereas, caring and committed mentors offer support for youth, providing them a
consistent friend, helping to ignite a young person’s curiosities, solidifying their passions,
and leveraging their talents, and
Whereas, mentored youths exhibit improved resiliency and better relationships with
peers, family, schools, and community, and
Whereas, 96 percent of mentored youths agree or strongly agree that “my mentor
makes me feel like I matter,” and 92 percent agree or strongly agree that “having a
mentor has made a positive difference in my life,” and
Whereas, mentoring relationships provide individualized attention and support, which
were primary components of personal rebounding from the pandemic, and
Whereas, Vermont mentoring agencies, including MENTOR Vermont and other
public and private organizations throughout the State, are committed to working
collaboratively to empower youth, advance the Vermont mentoring field, and broaden the
reach of mentoring relationships in our communities, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly designates February 13, 2025 as Youth Mentoring Day at
the State House, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
MENTOR Vermont.
