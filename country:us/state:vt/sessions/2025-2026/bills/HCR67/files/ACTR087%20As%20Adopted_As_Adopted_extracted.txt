Offered by Representatives Morrissey of Bennington, Cooper of Pownal, Corcoran of
Bennington, Durfee of Shaftsbury, Greer of Bennington, Hunter of Manchester, James of
Manchester, Nigro of Bennington, and Pinsonault of Dorset
Offered by Senators Bongartz and Plunkett
Whereas, during the 1770s, the volunteer militia members of the New Hampshire
Grants, living north of the province of Massachusetts in the frontier areas between the
Connecticut River and Lake Champlain, were known as the Green Mountain Boys, and
Whereas, the Green Mountain Boys were located within striking distance of the two
artillery-rich British forts, Crown Point and Ticonderoga, both perched on the western
shore of Lake Champlain, and
Whereas, in early May 1775, Ethan Allen, who lived in Bennington, directed his
fellow Green Mountain Boys at the Catamount Tavern, the militia’s de facto
headquarters, to bring their flintlock muskets north, in a discrete manner; to recruit more
Green Mountain Boys along the way; and to rendezvous in Castleton, where they would
be given further instructions, and
Whereas, the plan was finalized at Castleton and the Green Mountain Boys’ execution
of it resulted in the successful seizure of the British-held forts and the liberation of 78
cannons at Ticonderoga and 111 cannons at Crown Point, and these forays into British
fortifications were seen as the first patriot triumphs in the American War of
Independence from Great Britain, and
Whereas, these epic military operations and legendary feats forever enhanced the
reputation of the Green Mountain Boys and contributed to the successful American drive
to win independence from Great Britain, and
Whereas, in May 2025, Vermonters are commemorating the early role of the gallant
and heroic men of the New Hampshire Grants in the fight for American independence,
the prelude to Vermont’s admission as our nation’s 14th state, and
Whereas, in Bennington County, the commemoration of the “Expedition to
Ticonderoga: Ethan Allen, the Green Mountain Boys, and America’s First Victory,”
includes public events celebrating these brave deeds of 1775, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly commemorates the 250th anniversary of Ethan Allen’s
planning, in Bennington in 1775, of the successful Vermont initiation of the American
War of Independence and the associated expedition to Ticonderoga, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the Bennington Town Clerk.
