Whereas, the strength of the fourth-ranked Richford Rockets initial seventh-inning
lead proved crucial in their 2024 Division IV championship victory in Castleton against
the second-seeded West Rutland Golden Horde, and
Whereas, Richford exhibited impressive offensive prowess early in the contest,
scoring six runs in the second inning, expanding its lead in the third to 8–0, and to 9–0 in
the fourth, prior to West Rutland’s crossing the plate for a single run in the fifth and two
in the sixth, and
Whereas, in the decisive seventh inning, the Rockets increased their scoring advantage
to 11–3 in the opening frame, and Richford stoically withstood a four-run Golden Horde
final burst of energy to clinch the 2024 crown 11–7, and
Whereas, the delighted Rockets roster consisted of Jazzy Cunningham, Kyrielle
Deuso, Agnus Heinrich, Vanessa Tessier, Adi Chagnon, Katelyn Doe, Erin Raymond,
Sierra Derby, Maddie Combs, Kayliese McCray, Sophia Derby, Maddie Smith, and
Mikayla Chagnon, and
Whereas, Head Coach Dennis Blaney and assistant coaches Randi Chagnon and Kiley
Deuso motivated the Rockets to excel on the softball diamond, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2024 Richford Junior-Senior High
School Rockets Division IV championship softball team, and be it further
