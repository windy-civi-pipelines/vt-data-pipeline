* * * Legal Trails * * *
Sec. 43. FINDINGS; INTENT; LEGAL TRAILS
(a) Findings. The General Assembly finds the following:
(1) Outdoor recreation is a significant part of Vermont’s identity and
economy.
(2) Trails provide Vermonters and visitors with access to natural beauty
throughout the State and are used for a wide variety of outdoor recreational
activities throughout the year.
(3) Some trails are also used by Vermonters for travel or to access their
homes and properties.
(4) The State and municipalities use some trails to provide maintenance
to State and municipal lands and facilities, as well as to provide public safety
and rescue services.
(5) Trails may require regular maintenance to ensure that they remain
passable and can continue to support recreation, travel, access, and various
public services.
(6) While many trails in Vermont have been established through private
easements or other agreements, a subset of trails, known as legal trails, lie
along public rights-of-way that were once town highways and are governed by
the provisions of 19 V.S.A. chapter 3.
(b) Intent. It is the intent of the General Assembly to clarify municipalities’
authority to exclusively or cooperatively maintain legal trails under the
provisions of 19 V.S.A. chapter 3.

Sec. 44. FINDINGS; INTENT; LEGAL TRAILS

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.123

(a) Findings. The General Assembly finds the following:
(1) Outdoor recreation is a significant part of Vermont’s identity and
economy.
(2) Trails provide Vermonters and visitors with access to natural beauty
throughout the State and are used for a wide variety of outdoor recreational
activities throughout the year.
(3) Some trails are also used by Vermonters for travel or to access their
homes and properties.
(4) The State and municipalities use some trails to provide maintenance
to State and municipal lands and facilities, as well as to provide public safety
and rescue services.
(5) Trails may require regular maintenance to ensure that they remain
passable and can continue to support recreation, travel, access, and various
public services.
(6) While many trails in Vermont have been established through private
easements or other agreements, a subset of trails, known as legal trails, lie
along public rights-of-way that were once town highways and are governed by
the provisions of 19 V.S.A. chapter 3.
(b) Intent. It is the intent of the General Assembly to clarify municipalities’
authority to exclusively or cooperatively maintain legal trails under the
provisions of 19 V.S.A. chapter 3.
