5 homes and properties.
6 (4) The State and municipalities use some trails to provide maintenance
7 to State and municipal lands and facilities, as well as to provide public safety
8 and rescue services.
9 (5) Trails may require regular maintenance to ensure that they remain
10 passable and can continue to support recreation, travel, access, and various
11 public services.
12 (6) While many trails in Vermont have been established through private
13 easements or other agreements, a subset of trails, known as legal trails, lie
14 along public rights-of-way that were once town highways and are governed by
15 the provisions of 19 V.S.A. chapter 3.
