Whereas, the third-seeded Danville Bears experienced a variety of winning outcomes
on their journey to the Division IV championship game against the top-seeded West
Rutland Golden Horde; having overwhelmed 14th-seeded Rivendell Academy 102–38 in
the opening game, easily toppling 11th-ranked Long Trail School 71–31 in the
quarterfinal contest, and, in the thrilling semifinal round, narrowly defeating neighboring
second-seeded Twinfield/Cabot 48–47, and
Whereas, at the decisive game played at the Barre Auditorium, Danville jumped in
front quickly 10–2, was comfortably ahead at halftime 31–18, and clinched the school’s
first boys’ basketball crown, playing under their new mascot name, “the Bears,” 55–42,
with one teammate scoring an impressive seven three-point plays, and
Whereas, the triumphant Bears (20–4) were Kohl Guinard, Sebastian Eldred, Andrew
Joncas, Ben Barber, Connor Winn, Samson Kitonga, Alijah Andrews, Landen Fournier,
Arius Andrews, Jackson Giroux, and Keegan Wheeler, and
Whereas, Head Coach Jason Brigham; assistant coaches Robert Rome, Matt Colburn,
and Cooper Calkins; and Athletic Trainer Ryan Farley supported the team expertly and
effectively, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2025 Danville High School Bears
Division IV championship boys’ basketball team, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
