9 Referred to Committee on
10 Date:
11 Subject: Public service; building energy; building energy codes; residential
12 building energy standards; commercial building energy standards;
13 climate change; residential builder registry
14 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to extend the
15 term of the Building Energy Code Working Group, to direct the Public Service
16 Department to establish a framework to attribute savings to building energy
17 code compliance, to require the Department Public Service to develop
18 methodology for calculating and reporting greenhouse gas savings annually,
19 and to make changes to the Residential Builder Registry.
20 An act relating to Residential and Commercial Building Energy Standards
VT LEG #380156 v.2
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.181

1 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
2 Sec. 1. FINDINGS AND INTENT
3 The General Assembly finds:
4 (1) It is in the public interest to foster standards for buildings fit for
5 occupancy that are safe, healthful, comfortable, durable, energy efficient,
6 sustainable, resilient, and practicable.
7 (2) The five-year Housing Needs Assessment, released by Agency of
8 Commerce and Community Development in June 2024, found that at least
9 24,000 and as many as 36,000 housing units must be brought online by 2029.
10 In addition, the Assessment says about 20,000 existing homes have indications
11 of housing quality concerns according to 2022 census data.
12 (3) The Housing Needs Assessment also found that 32 percent of renters
13 had the income needed to buy a median priced home in 2021; two years later,
14 in 2023, house prices had risen to the extent that only six percent of renters
15 could likewise afford to buy a home.
16 (4) Buildings, whether single family owner-occupied, apartment houses,
17 or commercial occupancies, typically remain in service for many decades
18 without major renovation.
19 (5) As the costs of building increase, the costs of remediating poor or
20 energy inefficient construction exceed the capability or inclination of many
21 owners to undertake.
VT LEG #380156 v.2
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.181
2025 Page 3 of 9
1 (6) Recent floods have further exacerbated Vermont’s housing crisis and
2 demand for construction workers, and likely brought less experienced builders
3 into the construction market.
4 (7) Vermont established the Residential Building Energy Standards
5 (RBES) in 1997 and the Commercial Building Energy Standards (CBES) in
6 2007, collectively referred to as “energy codes.” Both energy codes are
7 mandatory, but studies in recent years show compliance with the RBES at
8 about 54 percent and CBES at about 87 percent, with both rates declining.
9 Both codes are scheduled to become more stringent with the goal of “net zero
10 ready” by 2030.
11 (8) There is no State agency or office designated to interpret, administer,
12 and enforce energy codes. The Division of Fire Safety in the Department of
13 Public Safety is responsible for fire and building safety code in “public
14 buildings.” The Department of Public Service is responsible for promulgating
15 and updating RBES and CBES. Neither office has the capacity to administer
16 or enforce energy codes.
17 (9) Applicability of energy codes and building codes in Vermont is
18 inconsistent. The RBES apply to residential buildings up to three stories; the
19 CBES apply to all other building types. The Division of Fire Safety
20 jurisdiction encompasses all public buildings, including rented residential
21 buildings covered by the RBES. However, its fire and building safety code is
VT LEG #380156 v.2
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.181
2025 Page 4 of 9
1 based on commercial codes; in residential buildings, it applies only to
2 apartment buildings four stories and above. While as of late 2024 the Division
3 of Fire Safety is in the process of considering adopting a residential building
4 code, currently Vermont has no building code covering residential construction
5 up to three stories in height. Further, the Department of Public Service has
6 advised the General Assembly that RBES-enabling legislation does not provide
7 clear authority for municipalities to administer and enforce the RBES at the
8 local level.
9 Sec. 2. 2024 Acts and Resolves No. 151, Sec. 2 is amended to read:
10 Sec. 2. ENERGY CODE COMPLIANCE; WORKING GROUP
11 * * *
12 (f) Meetings.

14 (4) The Working Group shall cease to exist on July 1, 2026 30 days after
15 the General Assembly enacts legislation giving authority to a State entity to
16 enforce the building energy codes.

1 (A) Electricity and natural gas. In place of utility-specific programs
2 developed pursuant to this section and section 218c of this title, the
3 Commission shall, after notice and opportunity for hearing, provide for the
4 development, implementation, and monitoring of gas and electric energy
5 efficiency and conservation programs and measures, including programs and
6 measures delivered in multiple service territories, by one or more entities
7 appointed by the Commission for these purposes. The Commission may
8 include appropriate combined heat and power systems that result in the
9 conservation and efficient use of energy and meet the applicable air quality
10 standards of the Agency of Natural Resources. Except with regard to a
11 transmission company, the Commission may specify that the appointment of
12 an energy efficiency utility to deliver services within an electric utility’s
13 service territory satisfies that electric utility’s corresponding obligations, in
14 whole or in part, under section 218c of this title and under any prior orders of
15 the Commission. The entities appointed under this subdivision (2) shall
16 attribute energy savings to building energy code compliance. The Department
17 of Public Service shall establish a procedure for calculating those building
18 energy savings.

5 (c) Revision and interpretation of energy standards. The Commissioner of
6 Public Service shall amend and update the RBES by means of administrative
7 rules adopted in accordance with 3 V.S.A. chapter 25. On or before January 1,
8 2011, the Commissioner shall complete rulemaking to amend the energy
9 standards to ensure that, to comply with the standards, residential construction
10 must be designed and constructed in a manner that complies with the 2009
11 edition of the IECC. After January 1, 2011, the Commissioner may direct the
12 timely and appropriate revision of the RBES after the issuance of updated
13 standards for residential construction under the IECC. The Department of
14 Public Service shall provide technical assistance and expert advice to the
15 Commissioner in the interpretation of the RBES and in the formulation of
16 specific proposals for amending the RBES. Prior to final adoption of each
17 required revision of the RBES, the Department of Public Service shall convene
18 an Advisory Committee to include one or more mortgage lenders, builders,
19 building designers, utility representatives, and other persons with experience
20 and expertise, such as consumer advocates and energy conservation experts.
21 The Advisory Committee may provide the Commissioner with additional

1 recommendations for revision of the RBES after they review the associated
2 software and handbook guidance for the update.
3 (1) Any amendments to the RBES shall be:
4 (A) consistent with duly adopted State energy policy, as specified in
5 section 202a of this title, and consistent with duly adopted State housing
6 policy;
7 (B) evaluated relative to their technical applicability and reliability;
8 and
9 (C) cost-effective and affordable from the consumer’s perspective.
10 (2) Each time the RBES are amended by the Commissioner, the
11 amended RBES shall become effective upon a date specified in the adopted
12 rule, a date that shall not be less than three six months after the date of
13 adoption. Persons commencing residential construction before the effective
14 date of the amended RBES shall have the option of complying with the
15 applicable provisions of the earlier or the amended RBES. After the effective
16 date of the original or the amended RBES, any person commencing residential
17 construction shall comply with the most recent version of the RBES.

4 accounting protocols that achieve transparent and accurate life cycle
5 accounting of greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions of such gases
