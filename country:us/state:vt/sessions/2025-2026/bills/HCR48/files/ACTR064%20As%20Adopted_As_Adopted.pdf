Offered by All Members of the House
Whereas, Curt McCormack was a passionate environmental advocate who worked
diligently to reduce sources of air pollution and encourage Vermonters’ transportation
choices in a direction eschewing cars and airplanes, and
Whereas, a licensed electrician by profession, Curt McCormack’s desire to serve his
fellow citizens in the legislative arena, and contribute an enduring beneficial impact on
both environmental and transportation policy, twice sparked him to stand for a seat in the
General Assembly, and
Whereas, in 1982, he won election to the House of Representatives as a member from
Rutland City, and during this first legislative foray, which extended to late 1995, he
chaired the House committee with environmental jurisdiction and was a national pioneer
in leading a State effort to limit the use of chlorofluorocarbons, and
Whereas, he departed from the General Assembly to serve as the Vermont Bicycle-
Pedestrian Coordinator at the Agency of Transportation, a role that enabled him to
implement facilities for human-powered transportation, and
Whereas, in 2012, having relocated to Burlington, Curt McCormack won election
from the city’s downtown-Old North End district, starting a new five-term legislative
tenure that featured his service as the unusually carless House Committee on
Transportation Chair; coincided with the extension to Burlington of the Ethan Allen
Express Amtrak rail service, which he was instrumental in establishing years earlier; and
included his election as a University of Vermont trustee, and
Whereas, he was a Peace Corps volunteer, who established a recycling facility in Joal,
Senegal; a cyclist, who bicycled extensively in North America and Europe; a painter; and
a music fan, whose diverse melodic pleasures ranged from Bob Dylan to opera, and
Whereas, Curt McCormack died of cancer on September 16, 2024 at 72 years of age,
and his survivors include his partner, Lisa Scofield, and his children, grandchildren, and
siblings, including former Senator Richard McCormack, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly extends its sincere condolences to the family of former
Representative Curt McCormack of Burlington, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the members of Curt McCormack’s family.
