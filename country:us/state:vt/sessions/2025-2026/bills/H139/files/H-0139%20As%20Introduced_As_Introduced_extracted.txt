BILL AS INTRODUCED H.139

1 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
2 Sec. 1. FINDINGS
3 The General Assembly finds that:
4 (1) Most secondary schools in Vermont do not employ any medical
5 personnel outside of school hours, when most athletic practices and events take
6 place, and injuries can occur at any time.
7 (2) In rural Vermont, where the majority of Vermont’s school athletic
8 facilities are located, emergency medical services (EMS) are spread thinly and
9 are frequently located a considerable distance away from the location of an
10 emergency call.
11 (3) Lack of rural cell phone coverage also impedes calling EMS to the
12 scene of an injury occurring at a secondary school athletic event.
13 (4) Many students are without personal or family transportation to
14 medical facilities on any given day and may delay seeking evaluation and
15 treatment that could be rendered by a licensed athletic trainer.
16 (5) Many students lack a primary care provider due to area shortages,
17 wait times, or family economic situation. For students of lower socioeconomic
18 status, an athletic trainer may be one of the only accessible medical providers.
19 Athletic trainers manage a myriad of injuries and illnesses and can make
20 proper referrals when warranted.
VT LEG #378668 v.4
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.139
2025 Page 3 of 5
1 (6) The scope of a licensed athletic trainer’s practice is codified in 26
2 V.S.A. chapter 83. It includes emergent care, first aid, and diagnostic skills for
3 various illnesses and injuries, such as concussion management, as well as the
4 capacity to get to know the whole athlete, both physically and mentally,
5 including the ability to recognize conditions such as eating disorders, anxiety,
6 and depression.
7 (7) Athletic trainers can educate individuals about, prevent, and
8 rehabilitate athletic-specific injuries and illnesses, which can in turn reduce the
9 stress placed on the broader health care network, which is already pushing the
10 limits of its capacity.
