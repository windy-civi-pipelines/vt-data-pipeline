determines to be appropriate.
(B) A data broker that ceases disclosing the protected information of
a covered person not more than 15 days after being served with process in a
civil suit brought by the covered person pursuant to subdivision (A) of this
subdivision (2) shall only be liable to the covered person for reasonable
attorney’s fees and court costs in the civil action. A data broker is not eligible
for the exception provided this subdivision (B) if the data broker:
(i) more than 15 days after receiving notice from a covered person
or the authorized agent of a covered person pursuant to subdivision (b)(2) of
this section discloses additional protected information of the covered person;
or
(ii) rediscloses protected information of the covered person after
having received notice pursuant to subdivision (b)(2) of this section.
(3) Standard of fault. In any judicial proceeding pursuant to this
section, the standard of fault shall be ordinary negligence. It shall not be a
defense to liability in a judicial proceeding that the covered person’s protected

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.342
2025 Page 26 of 29
information is or was available to the public from other sources, on the
internet or otherwise, or available by inspection of public records.
(d) Accessing information. A covered person or an authorized agent
accessing a data broker’s website or other public application for the purpose
of determining whether the covered person’s protected information is being
disclosed shall not, as a result of such access, be deemed to have agreed on
behalf of the covered person to any website terms and conditions with respect
to the covered person’s rights under this section.
(e) Limitations.
(1) A disclosure of protected information shall not constitute a violation
of this section if the disclosure is:
(A) made with the express or standing authorization of the covered
person, provided that the authorization is provided subsequent to the relevant
nondisclosure request; or
(B) for the sole purpose of facilitating a transaction initiated by the
covered person.
(2) This section does not apply to a data broker in a disclosure pursuant
to subdivision (1) of this subsection.
(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting an employer
from providing employee information to the Vermont Labor Relations Board or
to employee organizations that is required under Vermont law.

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.342
2025 Page 27 of 29
(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a data broker to
delete protected information.
Sec. 3. FORM OF NOTICE
The Attorney General shall publish the form of notice pursuant to 9 V.S.A.
§ 2448(b)(3) not later than 90 days after July 1, 2025, provided that until such
form is published, covered persons and their authorized agents may use their
own form of written notice that:
(1) references this section;
(2) identifies the sender as a covered person or an authorized agent
acting on behalf of a covered person;
(3) provides the covered person’s full name along with the specific
protected information of the covered person that is being disclosed by the data
broker; and
(4) requests that the data broker cease disclosing the specific protected
information of the covered person.
Sec. 4. STUDY AND REPORT ON PUBLIC AGENCY COMPLIANCE
(a) Study. The Agency of Digital Services, in consultation with the Agency
of Administration, the Office of the Secretary of State, the Office of the
Attorney General, and with other State agencies as requested by the Agency,
shall conduct a study to determine the various considerations and impacts on
State public agencies if public agencies were required to conform to the

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.342
2025 Page 28 of 29
disclosure policies set forth in this act. The Agency shall meet with and
receive input from relevant stakeholders in conducting its study, including the
Vermont League of Cities and Towns and the Vermont Municipal Clerks’ and
Treasurers’ Association. The Agency shall consider the following in its study:
(1) if public agencies were required to cease disclosing the protected
information of covered persons:
(A) the extent to which public agencies would currently be able to
accommodate these requests;
(B) the fiscal and resource impact on public agencies;
(C) whether additional staffing or training would be needed to
comply;
(D) the degree to which risk can be mitigated through State or local
policy; and
(E) determining which statutes, regulations, and administrative
policies require amending in order to accomplish the goal of public agencies
being able to cease the disclosure of protected information of covered persons;
(2) how other states have implemented similar requirements on their
public agencies, including the types of penalties levied for noncompliance;
(3) the feasibility of creating a State office to manage all statewide
requests to cease disclosing protected information; and
(4) any additional related areas of study as determined by the Agency.

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.342
2025 Page 29 of 29
(b) Report. On or before December 1, 2026, the Agency of Digital Services
shall submit a written report to the House Committee on Government
Operations and Military Affairs and the Senate Committee on Government
Operations with a summary of its findings pursuant to the study set forth in
subsection (a) of this section. The Agency shall also include in its report its
recommendations for legislative action and policy modification as well as a
suggested timeline for the implementation of the disclosure policies on public
agencies.

The private action provided to a covered person pursuant to 9 V.S.A.
§ 2448(c)(2) shall take effect on January 1, 2026.
Sec. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE
This act shall take effect on July 1, 2025.
