4 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
5 Sec. 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE
6 (a) The General Assembly finds that Vermont’s judges, prosecutors, law
7 enforcement officers, and other public servants play an essential role in the
8 functioning of the government of the State of Vermont and that the nature of
9 their official duties regularly places them in danger of death, serious physical
10 injury, and other reprisals from members of the public.
11 (b) Violence to and intimidation of such public servants and their families
12 is on the rise and public access to the personal information of these individuals
13 can be and has been used to facilitate violence and intimidation. The personal
14 information of these individuals is of negligible value to the public interest or
15 public discourse.
16 (c) Accordingly, the provisions of this act are both necessary and
17 appropriate to protect the privacy, safety, and security of public servants and to
18 prevent interference in the administration of justice and the operation of
19 government in the State of Vermont.
