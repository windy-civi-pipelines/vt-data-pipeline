Whereas, Charles Algernon Sidney Vivian inspired the establishment of the
Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks (the Elks), a momentous event that occurred in
New York City on February 16, 1868, and
Whereas, the purpose of this fraternal organization is “[t]o promote and practice the
four cardinal virtues of Charity, Justice, Brotherly Love and Fidelity; to promote the
welfare and enhance the happiness of its members; to quicken the spirit of American
Patriotism and cultivate good fellowship,” and
Whereas, Elks District Deputy P.M. Meldon of Rutland formed Bennington Lodge
No. 567 (the Lodge) on July 10, 1900, and John S. Brant served as the first Exalted Ruler
of the Lodge until 1902, and
Whereas, originally located at the 300 block of Main Street, in 1912, the Lodge moved
to the third floor of the Richie Building at 469 Main Street, and ultimately, in 1945, the
Lodge purchased the historic Winslow Home on Washington Avenue, which today
remains the Lodge’s headquarters, and
Whereas, the Lodge performs the central charitable prong of the Elks’ mission through
involvement in activities supporting youth (Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Little League
Baseball, the Hoop Shoot basketball competition, awarding scholarships totaling
$19,000.00 in 2024, sponsoring the Americanism Essay Contest, and promoting drug
awareness programs); assisting veterans (constructing a fishing dock, conducting a
fishing derby, hosting a Las Vegas Night, sponsoring Christmas events, and hosting
dining and entertainment activities); participating in the Elks’ State Project (operating
Silver Towers Camp in Ripton for children and adults with special needs); and offering
direct community support (by providing Thanksgiving meals and spearheading foster
family projects), and
Whereas, the 125th anniversary of the Lodge finds the organization thriving, boasting
a growing membership of over 800 enthusiastic Elks, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates Bennington Lodge No. 567 of the
Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks on 125 years of community service and good
fellowship, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Bennington Lodge No. 567 of the Benevolent Order of Elks.
