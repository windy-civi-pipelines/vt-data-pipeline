No. R-183. House concurrent resolution honoring Silas R. Loomis for his more than
half century of extraordinary municipal public service as the esteemed Castleton First
Constable.
(H.C.R.152)
Offered by Representatives Harvey of Castleton and Canfield of Fair Haven
Offered by Senators Collamore, Weeks, and Williams
Whereas, a lifelong Castleton resident, Si Loomis remembered his father’s sage advice
that “you owe more to your town than just paying taxes,” and when approached to run for
Castleton’s first constable, he agreed, and
Whereas, when assuming this position in 1972, he probably never dreamed that his
policing duties would extend until 2025, constituting one of the longest tenures ever for
any elected Castleton law enforcement officer, and
Whereas, unique among Vermont constables, Si Loomis conducted his summer patrols
on a police motorcycle, enabling him to work with the public on a more direct basis than
if driving a police cruiser, and
Whereas, in an act of true bravery, Si Loomis once rescued a man from his car that
had broken through the ice; on other occasions he assisted in roadside deliveries of
babies; and he was especially proud to provide law enforcement support at the Castleton
Elementary School for several years following the Sandy Hook Elementary School
shooting in Connecticut, and
Whereas, from 1990 to 1992, Si Loomis served as Castleton Chief of Police, and over
the years he had also worked as a part-time law enforcement official with the Addison
County Sheriff’s Department and the Rutland County Sheriff’s Office and the Brandon
and Middlebury Police Departments, and his first public safety position was as a
Castleton volunteer firefighter, and
Whereas, Si Loomis chaired the Vermont Constables’ Association, served as a
member of the Vermont Criminal Justice Training Council, and is a life member of the
National Constables and Marshals Association, and
Whereas, militarily, Si Loomis served as a U.S. Navy Seabee during the Vietnam War
and later with the Army National Guard, including postings to Kuwait and Iraq, serving
our country for a total of 40 years in uniform, and
Whereas, on March 4, 2025, after 53 years of patrolling the Castleton beat and earning
a wonderful reputation for dedication and loyalty to his hometown, Si Loomis concluded
his law enforcement career, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly honors Silas R. Loomis for his more than half century of
extraordinary municipal public service as the esteemed Castleton First Constable, and be
it further
VT LEG #384117 v.1
