7 foam; densifier; siting assessment
8 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to require the

16 EXPANDED POLYSTYRENE FOAM DENSIFIER IN THE STATE
17 (a) As used in this section:
18 (1) “EPS foam densifier” means a machine that shears, compresses, and

1 (2) “Expanded polystyrene foam” or “EPS foam” means a thermoplastic
2 petrochemical material utilizing the styrene monomer that is processed
3 according to multiple techniques, including fusion of polymer spheres,
4 injection molding, form molding, and extrusion-blow molding.
5 (b) The Secretary of Natural Resources shall assess the feasibility of siting
6 an EPS foam densifier in the State to serve as a site to transport waste EPS
7 foam for recycling or reuse. The Secretary shall coordinate with interested
8 parties in conducting the assessment, including solid waste management
9 entities, solid waste haulers, and representative of businesses that generate
10 waste EPS foam through manufacturing or shipping. On or before January 15,
11 2026, the Secretary of Natural Resources shall submit to the House Committee
12 on Environment and Energy and the Senate Committee on Natural Resources
13 and Energy a report with the results of the site assessment. The report shall
14 include:
15 (1) a recommendation of whether an EPS foam densifier should be sited
16 in Vermont, where it should be sited, and what entity would run the densifier;
17 (2) an estimate of the cost of the EPS foam densifier to purchase and
18 operate;
19 (3) a recommendation of whether EPS foam should be banned from
20 landfill disposal if an EPS foam densifier is located in the State; and
VT LEG #379375 v.1
