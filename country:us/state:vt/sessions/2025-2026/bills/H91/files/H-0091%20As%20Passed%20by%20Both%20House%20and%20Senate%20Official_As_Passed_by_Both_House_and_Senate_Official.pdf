6 PROGRAM
7 (a) The Emergency Temporary Shelter Program is established within the
8 Department for Children and Families for the purpose of temporarily
9 sheltering households pursuant to the eligibility criteria in section 2203 of this
10 chapter in a manner that ensures participant dignity and leads to greater
11 stability.
12 (b) Permissible shelter provided through this Program shall:
13 (1) include:
14 (A) community-based shelter provided by housing and shelter
15 operators, including community-based shelters for designated populations; and
16 (B) hotel and motel rooms only after the Department has exhausted
17 other means of providing community-based shelter; and
18 (2) limit relocation between community-based shelter sites.
19 (c)(1) If there is inadequate community-based shelter space available for a
20 household within the Agency of Human Services district in which the
21 household presents itself, the household shall be provided shelter in a hotel or

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE AND SENATE H.91
2025 Page 6 of 105

2 space becomes available in the district.
3 (2) Annually, the Department shall propose hotel and motel rates
4 through the budget process for consideration and approval by the General
5 Assembly. If the Department determines that a contractual agreement with a
6 hotel or motel operator to secure temporary emergency shelter capacity is
7 beneficial to improve the quality, cleanliness, or access to services for those
8 households temporarily sheltered in the facility, the Department shall be
9 authorized to enter into such an agreement in accordance with the per-room
10 rate established by the General Assembly; provided, however, that in no event
11 shall such an agreement cause a household to become unhoused. The
12 Department may include provisions to address access to services or related

17 Vermont Department of Health, and complying with the Licensed Lodging
18 Establishment Rule and the Vermont Fire and Building Safety Code. The

8 Department shall begin or resume payments at the contracted rate for lodging
9 once the violation ended. The Department may provide all, some, or none of
10 the payments withheld based on the nature and extent of the legal violations
11 and the effects of those violations on Emergency Temporary Shelter Program
12 households.

Sec. 1. FINDINGS
The General Assembly finds that:
(1) according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development’s 2024 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report, Vermont had
the fourth highest rate of homelessness in 2024 in that 53 of every 10,000

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE AND SENATE H.91
2025 Page 15 of 105
Vermonters are experiencing homelessness, with only Hawaii, New York, and
Oregon experiencing higher rates;
(2) in 2023, according to the same Annual Homelessness Assessment
Report, 51 of every 10,000 Vermonters were experiencing homelessness;
(3) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, there were
approximately 3,458 unhoused individuals in Vermont, which represents a 300
percent increase over the 1,110 unhoused individuals prior to the COVID-19
pandemic in 2020;
(4) of the 3,458 unhoused individuals in Vermont identified by the
Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, 166 experienced unsheltered
homelessness, which is the highest count of unsheltered homeless individuals in
Vermont within the past decade;
(5) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, over 35 percent
of those Vermonters experiencing homelessness were unhoused for more than
one year and over 72 percent were unhoused for more than 90 days;
(6) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, 737 of those
Vermonters experiencing homelessness were children and youth under 18 years
of age and 646 were 55 years of age or older;
(7) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, Black
Vermonters are 5.6 times more likely to be unhoused as compared to white
Vermonters;

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE AND SENATE H.91
2025 Page 16 of 105
(8) the 2024 Vermont Housing Needs Assessment notes that 36,000
primary homes are needed in Vermont between 2025–2029, 3,295 of which are
needed to address homelessness; and
(9) the 2024 Vermont Housing Needs Assessment notes that “[h]alf of
all Vermont renters are cost-burdened, and one-in-four pay more than 50
[percent] of their income on housing costs, putting them at high risk of
eviction,” which “is heightened by Vermont’s rental vacancy rate of 3
[percent], which is well below the 5 [percent] rate of a healthy market.”
Sec. 2. LEGISLATIVE INTENT
(a) It is the intent of the General Assembly that unsheltered homelessness
be eliminated and that homelessness in Vermont be rare, brief, and
nonrecurring.
(b) It is the intent of the General Assembly that the Vermont Homeless
Emergency Assistance and Responsive Transition to Housing Program
established in 33 V.S.A. chapter 22 is a step toward ensuring that:
(1) homelessness be reduced in Vermont and interim shelter
opportunities be available to provide a stable pathway to permanent housing
for all Vermonters experiencing homelessness, including safe shelter options
for individuals living in unsheltered homelessness;
(2) Vermont increase the supply of emergency shelter as well as
permanent supportive housing that meets the specific needs of individuals;

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE AND SENATE H.91
2025 Page 17 of 105
(3) community components of all shelter types are integrated in a
systemic manner;
(4) time limits, night-by-night shelter, relocation between interim shelter
sites, and other disruptions in housing stability be eliminated to the extent
possible;
(5) Vermont’s emergency housing statutes, rules, policies, procedures,
and practices be modeled on Housing First principles; and
(6) noncongregate shelter be used to the extent possible.
(c) It is the intent of the General Assembly that the Vermont Homeless
Emergency Assistance and Responsive Transition to Housing Program
established in 33 V.S.A. chapter 22 replaces the provision of emergency
housing through the General Assistance Program established in 33 V.S.A.
chapter 21 and the Housing Opportunity Grant Program.

approximately 3,458 unhoused individuals in Vermont, which represents a 300
percent increase over the 1,110 unhoused individuals prior to the COVID-19
pandemic in 2020;
(4) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, over 35 percent
of those Vermonters experiencing homelessness were unhoused for more than
one year and over 72 percent were unhoused for more than 90 days;

[percent], which is well below the 5 [percent] rate of a healthy market”;
(8) since 2020, the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board has
facilitated construction of 170 new single-family homeownership units and 269
new shelter beds; and
(9) the 2024 Vermont Housing Needs Assessment notes that “[h]alf of
all Vermont renters are cost-burdened, and one-in-four pay more than 50
[percent] of their income on housing costs, putting them at high risk of
eviction,” which “is heightened by Vermont’s rental vacancy rate of 3
[percent], which is well below the 5 [percent] rate of a healthy market”.

§ 2205. AUTHORIZATION PROCESS; REAUTHORIZATION REVIEW
(a) The Department shall select and enter into an agreement with a
statewide organization to provide or cause to be provided supportive services
and shelter to those households that are experiencing or that have experienced
domestic or sexual violence. The Department shall conduct regular reviews of

result in the Department deciding not to reauthorize the community action
agency. The Department may review progress of any previously required
corrective actions and may review community action agency performance
between reauthorization reviews.

addition to proposed corresponding decreases in the use of hotel and motel
rooms. The Department shall provide data pertaining to the percentage of
increased shelter capacity from the previous fiscal year in each region and how
that increase impacts the corresponding hotel and motel room usage for
emergency housing in each region pursuant to this subsection for the purpose
of informing regional planning and expectations.
(b) If hotels and motels are used to provide emergency shelter pursuant to
this chapter, the hotel and motel operators shall comply with Program rules
and the following rules:
