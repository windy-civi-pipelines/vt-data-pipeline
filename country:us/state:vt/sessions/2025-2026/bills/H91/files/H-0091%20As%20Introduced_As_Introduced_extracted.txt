2 PROGRAM
3 (a) The Emergency Temporary Shelter Program is established within the
4 Department for Children and Families for the purpose of temporarily sheltering
5 households pursuant to the eligibility criteria in section 2203 of this chapter in
6 a manner that ensures participant dignity and leads to greater stability.
7 (b) Permissible shelter provided through this Program shall:
8 (1) include:
9 (A) community-based shelter provided by housing and shelter
10 operators, including community-based shelters for designated populations; and
11 (B) hotel and motel rooms only after the Department has exhausted
12 other means of providing community-based shelter; and
13 (2) limit relocation between community-based shelter sites.
14 (c)(1) If there is inadequate community-based shelter space available for a
15 household within the Agency of Human Services district in which the
16 household presents itself, the household shall be provided shelter in a hotel or
17 motel within the district, if available, until adequate community-based shelter
18 space becomes available in the district.
19 (2) Annually, the Department shall propose hotel and motel rates
20 through the budget process for consideration and approval by the General
21 Assembly. If the Department determines that a contractual agreement with a
VT LEG #379532 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.91
2025 Page 6 of 14
1 hotel or motel operator to secure temporary emergency shelter capacity is
2 beneficial to improve the quality, cleanliness, or access to services for those
3 households temporarily sheltered in the facility, the Department shall be
4 authorized to enter into such an agreement in accordance with the per-room
5 rate established by the General Assembly; provided, however, that in no event
6 shall such an agreement cause a household to become unhoused. The
7 Department may include provisions to address access to services or related
8 needs within the contractual agreement.
9 (3) The use of hotel and motel rooms shall be contingent on a
10 participating hotel or motel complying with the public accommodation act
11 pursuant to 9 V.S.A. chapter 139, holding a lodging license issued by the
12 Vermont Department of Health, and complying with the Licensed Lodging
13 Establishment Rule and the Vermont Fire and Building Safety Code. The
14 Department may withhold full or partial payment to any hotel or motel
15 operator who violates any law or rule or whose lodging license is suspended,
16 revoked, expired, or otherwise invalid. Specifically, the Department may
17 withhold full or partial payment to hotel or motel operators to whom the
18 Department of Health has issued a conditional license, abatement order,
19 warning letter, or other notice of violation. Likewise, the Department may
20 withhold full or partial payment to hotel or motel operators who have received
21 notices from other State agencies that indicate that the hotel or motel operator
VT LEG #379532 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.91

1 has violated a law or rule. Once the Department is satisfied that the hotel or
2 motel operator is complying with the law and any corresponding rules, the
3 Department shall begin or resume payments at the contracted rate for lodging
4 once the violation ended. The Department may provide all, some, or none of
5 the payments withheld based on the nature and extent of the legal violations
6 and the effects of those violations on Emergency Temporary Shelter Program
7 households.
