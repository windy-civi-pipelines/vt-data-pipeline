Responsive Transition to Housing Program
The Senate proposes to the House to amend the bill by striking out all after
the enacting clause and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
* * * Findings and Legislative Intent * * *
Sec. 1. FINDINGS
The General Assembly finds that:
(1) according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development’s 2024 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report, Vermont had
the fourth highest rate of homelessness in 2024 in that 53 of every 10,000
Vermonters are experiencing homelessness, with only Hawaii, New York, and
Oregon experiencing higher rates;
(2) in 2023, according to the same Annual Homelessness Assessment
Report, 51 of every 10,000 Vermonters were experiencing homelessness;
(3) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, there were
approximately 3,458 unhoused individuals in Vermont, which represents a 300
percent increase over the 1,110 unhoused individuals prior to the COVID-19
pandemic in 2020;
(4) of the 3,458 unhoused individuals in Vermont identified by the
Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, 166 experienced unsheltered
homelessness, which is the highest count of unsheltered homeless individuals
in Vermont within the past decade;
(5) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, over 35
percent of those Vermonters experiencing homelessness were unhoused for
more than one year and over 72 percent were unhoused for more than 90 days;
(6) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, 737 of those
Vermonters experiencing homelessness were children and youth under 18 years
of age and 646 were 55 years of age or older;
(7) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, Black
Vermonters are 5.6 times more likely to be unhoused as compared to white
Vermonters;
(8) the 2024 Vermont Housing Needs Assessment notes that 36,000
primary homes are needed in Vermont between 2025–2029, 3,295 of which are
needed to address homelessness;

(9) the 2024 Vermont Housing Needs Assessment notes that “[h]alf of
all Vermont renters are cost-burdened, and one-in-four pay more than 50
[percent] of their income on housing costs, putting them at high risk of
eviction,” which “is heightened by Vermont’s rental vacancy rate of 3
[percent], which is well below the 5 [percent] rate of a healthy market”; and
(10) since 2020, the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board has
constructed 170 new single-family homeownership units and 269 new shelter
beds.
Sec. 2. LEGISLATIVE INTENT
(a) It is the intent of the General Assembly that unsheltered homelessness
be eliminated and that homelessness in Vermont be rare, brief, and
nonrecurring.
(b) It is the intent of the General Assembly that the Vermont Homeless
Emergency Assistance and Responsive Transition to Housing Program
established in 33 V.S.A. chapter 22 is a step toward ensuring that:
(1) homelessness be reduced in Vermont and interim shelter
opportunities be available to provide a stable pathway to permanent housing
for all Vermonters experiencing homelessness, including safe shelter options
for individuals living in unsheltered homelessness;
(2) Vermont increase the supply of emergency shelter as well as
permanent supportive housing that meets the specific needs of individuals;
(3) community components of all shelter types are integrated in a
systemic manner;
(4) time limits, night-by-night shelter, relocation between interim shelter
sites, and other disruptions in housing stability be eliminated to the extent
possible;
(5) Vermont’s emergency housing statutes, rules, policies, procedures,
and practices be modeled on Housing First principles where appropriate;
(6) noncongregate shelter be used to the extent possible; and
(7) Vermont reduce reliance on the inefficient use of hotel and motel
rooms to shelter participating households and expand the use of emergency
shelters throughout the State for this purpose.
(c) It is the intent of the General Assembly that the Vermont Homeless
Emergency Assistance and Responsive Transition to Housing Program
established in 33 V.S.A. chapter 22 replaces the provision of emergency
housing through the General Assistance Program established in 33 V.S.A.
chapter 21 beginning in fiscal year 2027 and the Housing Opportunity Grant
Program beginning in fiscal year 2028.

to Housing Program is established in the Department to provide services to
households that are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless, to the extent
funds exist.
(1) The Department shall select and enter into an agreement with a
statewide organization that has population-specific service experience to
provide or cause to be provided supportive services and shelter to those
households that are experiencing or that have experienced domestic or sexual
violence.
(2) All other participating households shall be served by or through a
community action agency responsible for a geographically distinct region of
the State. Community action agencies participating in the Program shall
provide or cause to be provided supportive services, extreme weather event

violence. If the statewide organization cannot fulfill its responsibilities under
this chapter, the Department shall work with another entity to ensure that there
is not a gap in services.

(b)(1) The Department shall authorize a community action agency to serve
or cause to be served households that are homeless or at risk of becoming
homeless in a geographically distinct region of the State if it meets the criteria
in this section. If a community action agency cannot fulfill its responsibilities
under this chapter, the Department shall work with other community action
agencies or other appropriate community entities to ensure that there is not a
gap in services in a community action agency’s region.
(2) A community action agency providing or causing to provide services

corrective actions by the Department if, within the constraint of appropriated
resources, it no longer meets the requirements in subdivision (2) of this
subsection or has failed to adequately meet the needs of households in its
region that are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Lack of compliance may
result in the Department deciding not to reauthorize the community action
agency. The Department may review progress of any previously required
corrective actions and may review community action agency performance
between reauthorization reviews.

§ 2206. VHEARTH CORE SERVICES

its budget presentation for approval by the General Assembly. A community
action agency shall not pay or cause to be paid with State monies a per room,
per night basis that exceeds the rate approved by the General Assembly.

(1) shall enter into agreements for the use of blocks of hotel and motel
rooms and negotiate the conditions of use for those blocks, including access
for providers of case management or other supportive services;
(2) shall prioritize the use of hotel and motel room agreements over
individual per room, per night hotel or motel room use, unless it is not
appropriate to a household’s needs; and

CHAPTER 59. COMMUNITY SERVICES ACTION AGENCIES
§ 3901. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE
(a) Recognizing that the economic well-being and social equity of every
Vermonter has long been a fundamental concern of the State, it remains

coordinate efforts that further this policy through:
(1) the strengthening of community capabilities for planning,
coordinating, and managing federal, State, and other sources of assistance
related to the problem of poverty;
(2) the better organization and utilization of a range of services related
to the needs of the poor individuals with low income; and

(3) the broadening of the resource base of programs to secure a more
active role in assisting the poor individuals with low income from business,
labor, and other groups from the private sector.

(a) The Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity is hereby
authorized to allocate available financial assistance for community services
action agencies and programs in accordance with State and federal law and

particularly acute problem. Components of those services and activities may
involve, without limitation of other activities and supporting facilities designed
to assist low income participants with low income:
