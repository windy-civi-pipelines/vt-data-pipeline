5 § 2202. ESTABLISHMENT; EMERGENCY TEMPORARY SHELTER
6 PROGRAM
7 (a) The Emergency Temporary Shelter Program is established within the
8 Department for Children and Families for the purpose of temporarily
9 sheltering households pursuant to the eligibility criteria in section 2203 of this
10 chapter in a manner that ensures participant dignity and leads to greater
11 stability.
12 (b) Permissible shelter provided through this Program shall:
13 (1) include:
14 (A) community-based shelter provided by housing and shelter
15 operators, including community-based shelters for designated populations; and
16 (B) hotel and motel rooms only after the Department has exhausted
17 other means of providing community-based shelter; and
18 (2) limit relocation between community-based shelter sites.
19 (c)(1) If there is inadequate community-based shelter space available for a
20 household within the Agency of Human Services district in which the
21 household presents itself, the household shall be provided shelter in a hotel or
BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.91
2025 Page 6 of 39
1 motel within the district, if available, until adequate community-based shelter
2 space becomes available in the district.
3 (2) Annually, the Department shall propose hotel and motel rates
4 through the budget process for consideration and approval by the General
5 Assembly. If the Department determines that a contractual agreement with a
6 hotel or motel operator to secure temporary emergency shelter capacity is
7 beneficial to improve the quality, cleanliness, or access to services for those
8 households temporarily sheltered in the facility, the Department shall be
9 authorized to enter into such an agreement in accordance with the per-room
10 rate established by the General Assembly; provided, however, that in no event
11 shall such an agreement cause a household to become unhoused. The
12 Department may include provisions to address access to services or related
13 needs within the contractual agreement.
14 (3) The use of hotel and motel rooms shall be contingent on a
15 participating hotel or motel complying with the public accommodation act
16 pursuant to 9 V.S.A. chapter 139, holding a lodging license issued by the
17 Vermont Department of Health, and complying with the Licensed Lodging
18 Establishment Rule and the Vermont Fire and Building Safety Code. The
19 Department may withhold full or partial payment to any hotel or motel
20 operator who violates any law or rule or whose lodging license is suspended,

3 warning letter, or other notice of violation. Likewise, the Department may
4 withhold full or partial payment to hotel or motel operators who have received
5 notices from other State agencies that indicate that the hotel or motel operator
6 has violated a law or rule. Once the Department is satisfied that the hotel or
7 motel operator is complying with the law and any corresponding rules, the
8 Department shall begin or resume payments at the contracted rate for lodging
9 once the violation ended. The Department may provide all, some, or none of
10 the payments withheld based on the nature and extent of the legal violations
11 and the effects of those violations on Emergency Temporary Shelter Program
12 households.

* * * Findings and Legislative Intent * * *
Sec. 1. FINDINGS
The General Assembly finds that:
(1) according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development’s 2024 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report, Vermont had
the fourth highest rate of homelessness in 2024 in that 53 of every 10,000
BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.91
2025 Page 15 of 39
Vermonters are experiencing homelessness, with only Hawaii, New York, and
Oregon experiencing higher rates;
(2) in 2023, according to the same Annual Homelessness Assessment
Report, 51 of every 10,000 Vermonters were experiencing homelessness;
(3) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, there were
approximately 3,458 unhoused individuals in Vermont, which represents a 300
percent increase over the 1,110 unhoused individuals prior to the COVID-19
pandemic in 2020;
(4) of the 3,458 unhoused individuals in Vermont identified by the
Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, 166 experienced unsheltered
homelessness, which is the highest count of unsheltered homeless individuals in
Vermont within the past decade;
(5) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, over 35 percent
of those Vermonters experiencing homelessness were unhoused for more than
one year and over 72 percent were unhoused for more than 90 days;
(6) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, 737 of those
Vermonters experiencing homelessness were children and youth under 18 years
of age and 646 were 55 years of age or older;
(7) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, Black
Vermonters are 5.6 times more likely to be unhoused as compared to white
Vermonters;
BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.91
2025 Page 16 of 39
(8) the 2024 Vermont Housing Needs Assessment notes that 36,000
primary homes are needed in Vermont between 2025–2029, 3,295 of which are
needed to address homelessness; and
(9) the 2024 Vermont Housing Needs Assessment notes that “[h]alf of
all Vermont renters are cost-burdened, and one-in-four pay more than 50
[percent] of their income on housing costs, putting them at high risk of
eviction,” which “is heightened by Vermont’s rental vacancy rate of 3
[percent], which is well below the 5 [percent] rate of a healthy market.”
Sec. 2. LEGISLATIVE INTENT
(a) It is the intent of the General Assembly that unsheltered homelessness
be eliminated and that homelessness in Vermont be rare, brief, and
nonrecurring.
(b) It is the intent of the General Assembly that the Vermont Homeless
Emergency Assistance and Responsive Transition to Housing Program
established in 33 V.S.A. chapter 22 is a step toward ensuring that:
(1) homelessness be reduced in Vermont and interim shelter
opportunities be available to provide a stable pathway to permanent housing
for all Vermonters experiencing homelessness, including safe shelter options
for individuals living in unsheltered homelessness;
(2) Vermont increase the supply of emergency shelter as well as
permanent supportive housing that meets the specific needs of individuals;
BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.91
2025 Page 17 of 39
(3) community components of all shelter types are integrated in a
systemic manner;
(4) time limits, night-by-night shelter, relocation between interim shelter
sites, and other disruptions in housing stability be eliminated to the extent
possible;
(5) Vermont’s emergency housing statutes, rules, policies, procedures,
and practices be modeled on Housing First principles; and
(6) noncongregate shelter be used to the extent possible.
(c) It is the intent of the General Assembly that the Vermont Homeless
Emergency Assistance and Responsive Transition to Housing Program
established in 33 V.S.A. chapter 22 replaces the provision of emergency
housing through the General Assistance Program established in 33 V.S.A.
chapter 21 and the Housing Opportunity Grant Program.

2 who are married, parties to a civil union, or unmarried.
3 (5) “Statewide vacancy rate” means the Vermont-specific rental vacancy
4 rate as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau.
5 § 2202. ESTABLISHMENT; EMERGENCY TEMPORARY SHELTER
6 PROGRAM
7 (a) The Emergency Temporary Shelter Program is established within the
8 Department for Children and Families for the purpose of temporarily
9 sheltering households pursuant to the eligibility criteria in section 2203 of this
10 chapter in a manner that ensures participant dignity and leads to greater
11 stability.
12 (b) Permissible shelter provided through this Program shall:
13 (1) include:
14 (A) community-based shelter provided by housing and shelter
15 operators, including community-based shelters for designated populations; and
16 (B) hotel and motel rooms only after the Department has exhausted
17 other means of providing community-based shelter; and
18 (2) limit relocation between community-based shelter sites.
19 (c)(1) If there is inadequate community-based shelter space available for a
20 household within the Agency of Human Services district in which the
21 household presents itself, the household shall be provided shelter in a hotel or

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.91
2025 Page 6 of 39
1 motel within the district, if available, until adequate community-based shelter
2 space becomes available in the district.
3 (2) Annually, the Department shall propose hotel and motel rates
4 through the budget process for consideration and approval by the General
5 Assembly. If the Department determines that a contractual agreement with a
6 hotel or motel operator to secure temporary emergency shelter capacity is
7 beneficial to improve the quality, cleanliness, or access to services for those
8 households temporarily sheltered in the facility, the Department shall be
9 authorized to enter into such an agreement in accordance with the per-room
10 rate established by the General Assembly; provided, however, that in no event
11 shall such an agreement cause a household to become unhoused. The
12 Department may include provisions to address access to services or related
13 needs within the contractual agreement.
14 (3) The use of hotel and motel rooms shall be contingent on a
15 participating hotel or motel complying with the public accommodation act
16 pursuant to 9 V.S.A. chapter 139, holding a lodging license issued by the
17 Vermont Department of Health, and complying with the Licensed Lodging
18 Establishment Rule and the Vermont Fire and Building Safety Code. The
19 Department may withhold full or partial payment to any hotel or motel
20 operator who violates any law or rule or whose lodging license is suspended,
21 revoked, expired, or otherwise invalid. Specifically, the Department may

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.91
2025 Page 7 of 39
1 withhold full or partial payment to hotel or motel operators to whom the
2 Department of Health has issued a conditional license, abatement order,
3 warning letter, or other notice of violation. Likewise, the Department may
4 withhold full or partial payment to hotel or motel operators who have received
5 notices from other State agencies that indicate that the hotel or motel operator
6 has violated a law or rule. Once the Department is satisfied that the hotel or
7 motel operator is complying with the law and any corresponding rules, the
8 Department shall begin or resume payments at the contracted rate for lodging
9 once the violation ended. The Department may provide all, some, or none of
10 the payments withheld based on the nature and extent of the legal violations
11 and the effects of those violations on Emergency Temporary Shelter Program
12 households.
13 § 2203. HOUSEHOLD ELIGIBILITY
14 To be eligible for the Program established in this chapter, a household shall
15 attest to lack of a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence and have a

2 substantially impedes the individual’s ability to live independently;
3 (B) written verification from the Social Security Administration;
4 (C) receipt of a disability check;

2 stalking, human trafficking, hate violence, or other dangerous or life-
3 threatening conditions that relate to violence against the individual or a
4 household member.
5 § 2204. MAXIMUM DAYS OF ELIGIBILITY
6 (a) The maximum number of days that a household receives shelter in a
7 hotel or motel under this Program, per 12-month period, shall be determined
8 by the statewide vacancy rate. If the statewide vacancy rate is:
9 (1) less than five percent at the household’s time of application, the
10 household shall receive a maximum of 90 sheltered days under this Program
11 per 12-month period; or
12 (2) is equal to or greater than five percent at the household’s time of
13 application, the household shall receive a maximum of 45 sheltered days under
14 this Program per 12-month period.
15 (b) No periods of ineligibility shall be imposed on the use of a household’s
16 maximum permitted sheltered days.
17 § 2205. HOUSEHOLD PARTICIPATION
18 Unless the head of the household has a disability as evidenced by
19 subdivision 2203(2) of this chapter that prevents the head of household’s
20 ability to participate in coordinated entry and case management processes, a
21 participating household sheltered pursuant to this chapter shall participate in

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.91
2025 Page 10 of 39
1 coordinated entry and case management processes if temporary emergency
2 shelter in excess of 14 days is required, including cooperating with the
3 Department and service providers on screening and care planning.
4 § 2206. APPLICATION; NOTICE; APPEALS
5 (a) All program applications and notices shall use plain language.
6 (b) The Department shall provide written notice, and notice in the
7 household’s preferred form of communication, of appeal rights related to
8 departmental decisions made in the course of administering the Program
9 established in this chapter, including appeal rights related to the denial of an
10 initial application.
11 (c) A household sheltered in accordance with this Program may continue to
12 remain sheltered while the appeal is pending until the household’s maximum
13 sheltered days for the current 12-month period have expired.
14 § 2207. MONTHLY REPORTING
15 Monthly, the Department shall post the following on its website:
16 (1) the annual total and average monthly number of households
17 participating in the Program by household size, by eligibility category, and by
18 each Agency of Human Services district;

Sec. 1. FINDINGS
The General Assembly finds that:
(1) according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development’s 2024 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report, Vermont had
the fourth highest rate of homelessness in 2024 in that 53 of every 10,000

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.91
2025 Page 15 of 39
Vermonters are experiencing homelessness, with only Hawaii, New York, and
Oregon experiencing higher rates;
(2) in 2023, according to the same Annual Homelessness Assessment
Report, 51 of every 10,000 Vermonters were experiencing homelessness;
(3) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, there were
approximately 3,458 unhoused individuals in Vermont, which represents a 300
percent increase over the 1,110 unhoused individuals prior to the COVID-19
pandemic in 2020;
(4) of the 3,458 unhoused individuals in Vermont identified by the
Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, 166 experienced unsheltered
homelessness, which is the highest count of unsheltered homeless individuals in
Vermont within the past decade;
(5) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, over 35 percent
of those Vermonters experiencing homelessness were unhoused for more than
one year and over 72 percent were unhoused for more than 90 days;
(6) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, 737 of those
Vermonters experiencing homelessness were children and youth under 18 years
of age and 646 were 55 years of age or older;
(7) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, Black
Vermonters are 5.6 times more likely to be unhoused as compared to white
Vermonters;

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.91
2025 Page 16 of 39
(8) the 2024 Vermont Housing Needs Assessment notes that 36,000
primary homes are needed in Vermont between 2025–2029, 3,295 of which are
needed to address homelessness; and
(9) the 2024 Vermont Housing Needs Assessment notes that “[h]alf of
all Vermont renters are cost-burdened, and one-in-four pay more than 50
[percent] of their income on housing costs, putting them at high risk of
eviction,” which “is heightened by Vermont’s rental vacancy rate of 3
[percent], which is well below the 5 [percent] rate of a healthy market.”
Sec. 2. LEGISLATIVE INTENT
(a) It is the intent of the General Assembly that unsheltered homelessness
be eliminated and that homelessness in Vermont be rare, brief, and
nonrecurring.
(b) It is the intent of the General Assembly that the Vermont Homeless
Emergency Assistance and Responsive Transition to Housing Program
established in 33 V.S.A. chapter 22 is a step toward ensuring that:
(1) homelessness be reduced in Vermont and interim shelter
opportunities be available to provide a stable pathway to permanent housing
for all Vermonters experiencing homelessness, including safe shelter options
for individuals living in unsheltered homelessness;
(2) Vermont increase the supply of emergency shelter as well as
permanent supportive housing that meets the specific needs of individuals;

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.91
2025 Page 17 of 39
(3) community components of all shelter types are integrated in a
systemic manner;
(4) time limits, night-by-night shelter, relocation between interim shelter
sites, and other disruptions in housing stability be eliminated to the extent
possible;
(5) Vermont’s emergency housing statutes, rules, policies, procedures,
and practices be modeled on Housing First principles; and
(6) noncongregate shelter be used to the extent possible.
(c) It is the intent of the General Assembly that the Vermont Homeless
Emergency Assistance and Responsive Transition to Housing Program
established in 33 V.S.A. chapter 22 replaces the provision of emergency
housing through the General Assistance Program established in 33 V.S.A.
chapter 21 and the Housing Opportunity Grant Program.
