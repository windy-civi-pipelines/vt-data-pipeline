5 Sec. 1. FINDINGS
6 The General Assembly finds that:
7 (1) according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
8 Development’s 2024 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report, Vermont had
9 the fourth highest rate of homelessness in 2024 in that 53 of every 10,000
10 Vermonters are experiencing homelessness, with only Hawaii, New York, and
11 Oregon experiencing higher rates;
12 (2) according to the Vermont Homeless Management Information
13 System, as of March 2025 there were 4,971 individuals who were homeless in
14 the State, 1,105 of whom were children;
15 (3) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, there were
16 approximately 3,458 unhoused individuals in Vermont, which represents a 300
17 percent increase over the 1,110 unhoused individuals prior to the COVID-19
18 pandemic in 2020;
19 (4) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, over 35
20 percent of those Vermonters experiencing homelessness were unhoused for

5 primary homes are needed in Vermont between 2025–2029, 3,295 of which are

7 (7) the 2024 Vermont Housing Needs Assessment notes that “[h]alf of
8 all Vermont renters are cost-burdened, and one-in-four pay more than 50
9 [percent] of their income on housing costs, putting them at high risk of
10 eviction,” which “is heightened by Vermont’s rental vacancy rate of 3
11 [percent], which is well below the 5 [percent] rate of a healthy market”;
12 (8) since 2020, the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board has
13 facilitated construction of 170 new single-family homeownership units and 269
14 new shelter beds; and

17 this chapter, the hotel and motel operators shall comply with Program rules and
