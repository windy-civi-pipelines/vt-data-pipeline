4 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
5 * * * Findings and Legislative Intent * * *
6 Sec. 1. FINDINGS
7 The General Assembly finds that:
8 (1) according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
9 Development’s 2024 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report, Vermont had
10 the fourth highest rate of homelessness in 2024 in that 53 of every 10,000
11 Vermonters are experiencing homelessness, with only Hawaii, New York, and
12 Oregon experiencing higher rates;
13 (2) in 2023, according to the same Annual Homelessness Assessment
14 Report, 51 of every 10,000 Vermonters were experiencing homelessness;
15 (3) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, there were
16 approximately 3,458 unhoused individuals in Vermont, which represents a 300
17 percent increase over the 1,110 unhoused individuals prior to the COVID-19
18 pandemic in 2020;
19 (4) of the 3,458 unhoused individuals in Vermont identified by the
20 Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, 166 experienced unsheltered
VT LEG #382368 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.91
2025 Page 2 of 26
1 homelessness, which is the highest count of unsheltered homeless individuals
2 in Vermont within the past decade;
3 (5) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, over 35
4 percent of those Vermonters experiencing homelessness were unhoused for
5 more than one year and over 72 percent were unhoused for more than 90 days;
6 (6) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, 737 of those
7 Vermonters experiencing homelessness were children and youth under 18
8 years of age and 646 were 55 years of age or older;
9 (7) according to the Vermont 2024 Point-in-Time Count, Black
10 Vermonters are 5.6 times more likely to be unhoused as compared to white
11 Vermonters;
12 (8) the 2024 Vermont Housing Needs Assessment notes that 36,000
13 primary homes are needed in Vermont between 2025–2029, 3,295 of which are
14 needed to address homelessness; and
15 (9) the 2024 Vermont Housing Needs Assessment notes that “[h]alf of
16 all Vermont renters are cost-burdened, and one-in-four pay more than 50
17 [percent] of their income on housing costs, putting them at high risk of
18 eviction,” which “is heightened by Vermont’s rental vacancy rate of 3
19 [percent], which is well below the 5 [percent] rate of a healthy market.”
