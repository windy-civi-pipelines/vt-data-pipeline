12 An act relating to creating the Vermont Olympics Task Force
13 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
14 Sec. 1. FINDINGS
15 The General Assembly finds the following:
16 (1) That the Olympic host selection process has been reformed in recent
17 years to reduce the cost of hosting and to make the Olympic Games
18 organization more sustainable. According to the International Olympic
19 Committee:
VT LEG #379900 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.367
2025 Page 2 of 6
1 (A) Olympic hosts must maximize the use of existing and temporary
2 venues and build new ones only if there is a long-term legacy need. Events
3 can be located in more than one city, region, or country.
4 (B) Olympic projects, or bids, are assessed according to several
5 elements, including how well they fit with existing regional and national
6 development plans, in addition to the long-term strategic goals of the
7 Olympics. Any project shall have strong public and political support and be
8 aligned with local long-term socioeconomic development plans.
9 (C) Each potential host should focus on developing a climate-
10 responsible project that will create lasting community benefits.
11 (2) That climate change has begun to impact Vermont with less snow,
12 more rain, and landslides forcing a reconsideration of the way the State’s land
13 is used. Climate disasters especially affect the public health and economic
14 benefits of the State’s recreation industry. Tourism in Vermont is a three-
15 billion-dollar industry that supports over 30,000 jobs in Vermont, or 10 percent
16 of Vermont’s workforce. The Vermont Department of Tourism and Marketing
17 (VDTM) appreciates the importance of cultivating the international tourism
18 market. There are a variety of ways that VDTM targets international
19 audiences, including having representation on the ground in key markets,
20 hosting international media in Vermont, and meeting with domestic receptive
21 tour operators.

1 (3) In the face of climate change, the General Assembly must make
2 decisions about how to invest in sustainable and resilient infrastructure in our
3 regional planning, land use, and economic development. As the State adapts to
4 meet the great challenges of life on Earth in the 21st century, we can promote a
5 more sustainable, equitable, and resilient way of life here and also across the
6 planet through the process of hosting the Olympic Games.
