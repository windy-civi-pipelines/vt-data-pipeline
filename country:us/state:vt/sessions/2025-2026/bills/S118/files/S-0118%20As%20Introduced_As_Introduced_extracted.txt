6 property transfer tax; income tax
7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to enact multiple
8 provisions related to economic development on farms. The bill would amend
9 the requirements for the seasonal application of manure to provide an
10 exemption from the ban when liquid manure is applied through direct soil
11 injection. The bill also would exempt farms in compliance with the required
12 agricultural practices from the three-acre stormwater permit. In addition, the
13 bill would amend the right-to-farm law to provide farms with additional
14 protection from nuisance or trespass claims. The bill also clarifies that farm
15 structures, including fences, are exempt from regulation under municipal
16 bylaws or ordinances. In addition, the bill provides that farm employee
17 housing is exempt from regulation under municipal bylaw or ordinance. The
18 bill would amend the eligibility criteria for accessory on-farm businesses and
19 for eligibility of agricultural land under the Use Value Appraisal Program. The
20 bill also would exempt certain transfers of property that is part of a farming
21 operation from the property transfer tax. In addition, the bill would exempt

2 CHAPTER 195. NUISANCE SUITS AGAINST AGRICULTURAL
3 ACTIVITIES
4 § 5751. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE
5 The General Assembly finds that agricultural production is a major
6 contributor to the State’s economy; that agricultural lands constitute unique
7 and irreplaceable resources of statewide importance; that the continuation of
8 existing and the initiation of new agricultural activities preserve the landscape
9 and environmental resources of the State, contribute to the increase of tourism,
10 and further the economic welfare and self-sufficiency of the people of the
11 State; and that the encouragement, development, improvement, and
12 preservation of agriculture will result in a general benefit to the health and
13 welfare of the people of the State. In order for the agricultural industry to
14 survive in this State, farms will likely change, adopt new technologies, and
15 diversify into new products, which for some farms will mean increasing in
16 size. The General Assembly finds that agricultural activities are potentially
17 subject to lawsuits based on the theory of nuisance, and that these suits
18 encourage and could force the premature removal of the farmlands and other
19 farm resources from agricultural use. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect
20 reasonable agricultural activities conducted on the farm from nuisance
21 lawsuits.

2 conditions under subsection 4464(b) of this title to protect wildlife habitat;
3 threatened or endangered species; or other natural, historic, or scenic resources
4 and does not prevent the municipality from enforcing such conditions,
5 provided that the reasonable conditions do not restrict or regulate forestry
6 operations unrelated to land development.
7 (5) If a municipal bylaw or ordinance purports to regulate a practice
8 regulated under the required agricultural practices or to regulate a farm
9 structure, the owner or operator of a farm within the municipality may request

4 Date:
5 Subject: Agriculture; economic development; stormwater permitting; land use;

7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to enact multiple
8 provisions related to economic development on farms. The bill would amend
9 the requirements for the seasonal application of manure to provide an
10 exemption from the ban when liquid manure is applied through direct soil
11 injection. The bill also would exempt farms in compliance with the required
12 agricultural practices from the three-acre stormwater permit. In addition, the
13 bill would amend the right-to-farm law to provide farms with additional
14 protection from nuisance or trespass claims. The bill also clarifies that farm
15 structures, including fences, are exempt from regulation under municipal
16 bylaws or ordinances. In addition, the bill provides that farm employee
17 housing is exempt from regulation under municipal bylaw or ordinance. The
18 bill would amend the eligibility criteria for accessory on-farm businesses and
19 for eligibility of agricultural land under the Use Value Appraisal Program. The
20 bill also would exempt certain transfers of property that is part of a farming
21 operation from the property transfer tax. In addition, the bill would exempt

2 CHAPTER 195. NUISANCE SUITS AGAINST AGRICULTURAL
3 ACTIVITIES
4 § 5751. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE
5 The General Assembly finds that agricultural production is a major
6 contributor to the State’s economy; that agricultural lands constitute unique
7 and irreplaceable resources of statewide importance; that the continuation of
8 existing and the initiation of new agricultural activities preserve the landscape
9 and environmental resources of the State, contribute to the increase of tourism,
10 and further the economic welfare and self-sufficiency of the people of the
11 State; and that the encouragement, development, improvement, and
12 preservation of agriculture will result in a general benefit to the health and
13 welfare of the people of the State. In order for the agricultural industry to
14 survive in this State, farms will likely change, adopt new technologies, and
15 diversify into new products, which for some farms will mean increasing in
16 size. The General Assembly finds that agricultural activities are potentially
17 subject to lawsuits based on the theory of nuisance, and that these suits
18 encourage and could force the premature removal of the farmlands and other
19 farm resources from agricultural use. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect
20 reasonable agricultural activities conducted on the farm from nuisance
21 lawsuits.

5 affect other provisions of this chapter that can be given effect without the

10 structures, as those practices are defined by the Secretary of Agriculture, Food

1 panel otherwise has jurisdiction under this chapter, from imposing reasonable
2 conditions under subsection 4464(b) of this title to protect wildlife habitat;
3 threatened or endangered species; or other natural, historic, or scenic resources
4 and does not prevent the municipality from enforcing such conditions,
5 provided that the reasonable conditions do not restrict or regulate forestry
6 operations unrelated to land development.
7 (5) If a municipal bylaw or ordinance purports to regulate a practice
8 regulated under the required agricultural practices or to regulate a farm
9 structure, the owner or operator of a farm within the municipality may request
10 an opinion from the Secretary of Agriculture, Food and Markets as to whether

8 $250,000.00 in annual sales. No permit or permit amendment is required for
9 the construction of improvements for an accessory on-farm business for
10 educational, recreations, or social events that feature agriculture practices or
11 qualifying products, as those terms are defined in 24 V.S.A.
12 § 4412(11)(A)(i)(II). This subsection shall not apply to the construction of
