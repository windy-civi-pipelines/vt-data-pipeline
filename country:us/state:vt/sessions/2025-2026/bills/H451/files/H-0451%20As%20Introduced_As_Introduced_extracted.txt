10 Sec. 1. LEGISLATIVE INTENT
11 (a) Equal opportunity is a fundamental principle of American democracy.
12 (b) Equal access to economic opportunity and to cultural empowerment are
13 priorities of the State of Vermont.
14 (c)(1) Structural racism, defined as the laws, policies, institutional
15 practices, cultural representations, and other societal norms that often work
16 together to deny equal opportunity, has resulted in wealth disparities and
17 cultural disempowerment among Vermonters.
18 (2) Great social costs arise from these inequities, including threats to
19 economic development, democracy, and the social health and wellness of the
20 State of Vermont.
VT LEG #380683 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.451
2025 Page 2 of 19
1 (d)(1) Wealth disparities are a function of not only access to income, but
2 also the ability to have access to the land, to property ownership, and to
3 cultural preservation and empowerment, which has been impacted by race,
4 ethnicity, sex, geography, language preference, immigrant or citizen status,
5 sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, and disability status.
6 (2) Wealth disparities and cultural disempowerment directly and
7 indirectly affect the health and wellness of individuals and communities.
8 (e)(1) The foundation of our current economic system was built on land
9 that was taken from Abenaki and other Indigenous persons, and the structures
10 of our economic system were constructed with the labor of enslaved persons.
11 (2) The legacy of settler colonialism and chattel slavery has been
12 systemic racism and discrimination embedded into many aspects of our
13 modern way of life on this land.
14 (3) The relationship between all persons and the land has been used to
15 oppress persons over the past several centuries.
16 (4) The laws and policies of our State and nation severed Indigenous
17 persons from their land while denying them, Black persons, and other persons
18 of color from having the opportunity to access and own land.
19 (5) These actions of the State led to systemic racism that has impacted
20 all Vermonters who have historically suffered from discrimination and who
21 have not had equal access to public or private economic benefits due to race,
VT LEG #380683 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.451
2025 Page 3 of 19
1 ethnicity, sex, geography, language preference, immigrant or citizen status,
2 sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, or disability status.
3 (6) The actions of the State have led to the erasure or appropriation of
4 culture for the descendants of slaves and Indigenous persons.
5 (f)(1) In order to offer repair for the systemic discrimination faced by many
6 persons throughout the State over the past four centuries, the State of Vermont
7 must engage in a just transition to an economic system that systemically
8 undoes racism instead of reinforcing it.
9 (2) Efforts to remedy wealth disparity in the United States have
10 traditionally looked to the free market, extractive economy for solutions to the
11 very problem that it has created.
12 (3) However, there has been increased recognition that improving access
13 to economic opportunity and cultural empowerment will require broader
14 approaches.
15 (4) In order to rectify this history of inequity, we must create economic
16 opportunity and cultural empowerment, using new systems that empower and
17 center Vermonters who have historically suffered from discrimination and who
18 have not had equal access to public or private economic benefits due to race,
19 ethnicity, sex, geography, language preference, immigrant or citizen status,
20 sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, or disability status.
VT LEG #380683 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.451
2025 Page 4 of 19
1 (g) It is therefore the intent of the General Assembly to acknowledge and
2 address wealth disparity and cultural disempowerment by creating economic
3 opportunity and cultural empowerment for Vermonters who have historically
4 suffered from discrimination and who have not had equal access to public or
5 private economic benefits due to race, ethnicity, sex, geography, language
6 preference, immigrant or citizen status, sexual orientation, gender identity,
7 socioeconomic status, or disability status by ensuring equal access to economic
8 advancement and cultural reconstruction in the State of Vermont.
9 (h) In addition to the actions taken by this act, the State must engage in a
10 deep process of truth and reconciliation, guided by the persons who have been
11 most impacted, to address the underlying wounds of colonization and slavery.
12 Sec. 2. FINDINGS
13 (a) Definitions. As used in this section:
14 (1) “Non-White” means Black, Indigenous, and other Persons of Color
15 (BIPOC). The term is not intended to reflect self-identity but rather how
16 persons are categorized in the racial caste system on which discrimination has
17 been historically based in the United States. This term is used in this act
18 because currently Vermont typically disaggregates data solely by White and
19 non-White.
20 (2) “Race and ethnicity” means the categories for classifying individuals
21 that have been created by prevailing social perceptions, historical policies, and
VT LEG #380683 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.451
2025 Page 5 of 19
1 practices. The term includes how individuals perceive themselves and how
2 individuals are perceived by others.
3 (b) Wealth disparity in Vermont. Concerning the history of wealth
4 disparity in Vermont, the General Assembly finds:
5 (1) History, research, and experience demonstrate that Vermont
6 residents experience barriers to the equal enjoyment and benefit of economic
7 opportunity and cultural empowerment based on race and ethnicity.
8 (2) The United States was founded as a country on a triangular
9 relationship between settlers, native persons, and slaves.
10 (3) This structure created an inequity for wealth, economic resources,
11 cultural empowerment, homeownership, and land access through systemic
12 oppression and systematic racism for those who were defined as native or
13 slave.
14 (4) Prior to Vermont self-declaring its occupation of the land in 1777, it
15 is estimated that at least 10,000 Indigenous persons were living in the region,
16 specifically upwards of 4,000 Abenaki living in the Champlain Valley.
17 (5) Centuries of genocide, eugenics, broken treaties, displacement, and
18 land dispossession placed persons of the Abenaki Nations and other
19 Indigenous persons living in Vermont at a great social disadvantage.
20 (6) Although the original Vermont Constitution abolished slavery in this
21 State, with two exception clauses, it took until 1854 for African Americans to
VT LEG #380683 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.451
2025 Page 6 of 19
1 be considered legally free and not considered as property in the State, and not
2 until 1863 were African Americans federally recognized as free from
3 enslavement.
4 (7) During and since these early days of colonization and slavery, due to
5 local, State, and federal policies that were intentionally developed to
6 economically, socially, and racially discriminate against members of the
7 BIPOC community, multigenerational poverty has created a disturbing
8 disproportionate wealth gap for land and home ownership in what we now
9 know as Vermont and the United States.
10 (8) Federal land policies and programs denied members of the BIPOC
11 community farmland ownership opportunities that were available to their
12 White counterparts.
13 (9) The federal government’s creation of early land use policies, such as
14 those adopted under President Andrew Johnson, who overturned the infamous
15 “40 acres and a mule” and implemented “states’ rights” based reconstruction
16 policies, resulted in sharecropping.
17 (10) Sharecropping was the federal government prohibiting Black
18 farmers from owning property, and as a result, they were forced to rent land
19 from White landlords. Reconstruction policies resulted in sharecropping and
20 prohibiting Black farmers from owning property, and as a result, they were
VT LEG #380683 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.451
2025 Page 7 of 19
1 forced to rent land from White landlords. Many Black farmers at this time
2 experienced unfair terms and agreements.
3 (11) The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Farm Service
4 Agency (FSA) Loan Distribution Program has made it difficult for Black and
5 other persons of color to own farmland.
6 (12) In 1910, it was reported that 14 percent of all farm owner operators
7 in the United States were Black or African American. By 2012, they
8 comprised only 1.5 percent of farm owners across the country.
9 (13) Redlining was the practice of denying bank loans for mortgages to
10 Black and other persons of color, and it was used to segregate Black and other
11 communities of color into inner city neighborhoods. Redlining has drastically
12 impacted members of the BIPOC community for generations and has further
13 withheld generational wealth from the Black communities.
14 (14) The Housing and Urban Development’s Home Owners’ Loan
15 Corporation (HOLC) program denied Black and brown residents’ equal access
16 to home mortgages, often offering subprime loans that came with unusually
17 severe terms.
18 (15) Funds from the GI Bill intended to insure private mortgages, reduce
19 down payments, and cover tuition were only made available to White veterans,
20 denying BIPOC veterans access to wealth, land, and home ownership thus
21 denying them access to the economic opportunity of generational wealth.
VT LEG #380683 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.451
2025 Page 8 of 19
1 (16) Despite amendments to the U.S. Constitution and the 1866 Civil
2 Rights Act, systemic racism, within both Vermont’s housing and agricultural
3 sectors, remains prevalent today.
4 (17) On July 16, 2020, Burlington, Vermont, took the bold move to
5 declare racism as a public health emergency, citing that only four percent of
6 the homes owned in Burlington were owned by persons of color while making
7 up 18 percent of the population and that they were four and a half times as
8 likely to be denied for a home loan compared to applicants who are White.
9 (18) Housing disparity and land access may increase with COVID-19,
10 advancing the triple threats of oppression—racism, classism, and sexism—in
11 the State.
12 (19) Without adequate access to land and home ownership, BIPOC are
13 forced to live in multigenerational housing, placing them at higher risk to
14 COVID-19 exposure.
15 (20) Nearly a quarter of Black Vermonters live in poverty, compared
16 with 11 percent of Vermonters overall. However, poverty rates for the BIPOC
17 community exceeded the State average in 2018. Poverty rates were also
18 greater among persons who include themselves in two or more racial groups or
19 identified as American Indian or of Hispanic or Latino origin.
20 (c) Concerning the connection among health, wealth, and property
21 ownership, the General Assembly finds:
VT LEG #380683 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.451
2025 Page 9 of 19
1 (1) Food insecurity rates are higher for members of the BIPOC
2 community who reside in the State of Vermont than their White neighbors.
3 (2) During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was estimated by the University
4 of Vermont that 49 percent of BIPOC households in the State experienced food
5 insecurity compared to 25.2 percent of White households. Food insecurity has
6 been linked to and known to cause mental health problems and depression,
7 hypertension and hyperlipidemia, worse outcomes on health exams, being in
8 poor or fair health, poor sleep, and obesity.
9 (3) According to the 2018 Vermont Department of Health’s Behavioral
10 Risk Factor Surveillance System report, non-White Vermonters are:
11 (A) statistically less likely to have a personal doctor;
12 (B) statistically more likely to report poor mental health;
13 (C) more than twice as likely to report rarely or never getting the
14 emotional and social support they need;
15 (D) significantly more likely to have depression;
16 (E) significantly more likely to have been worried about having
17 enough food in the past year; and
18 (F) significantly more likely to report no leisure-time physical
19 activity.
20 (4) The average age is 33 for BIPOC Vermonters, versus 46 for
21 Vermonters who are White.
VT LEG #380683 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.451
2025 Page 10 of 19
1 (5) BIPOC Vermonters are at a higher risk for more serious health
2 outcomes, such as hospitalization.
3 (6) Although there are not statistically significant differences in the rates
4 of pre-existing conditions, including diabetes, lung disease, and cardiovascular
5 disease, among all Vermonters, there are disparities in rates of pre-existing
6 conditions among COVID-19 cases. The pre-existing conditions rate among
7 COVID-19 cases is 19.4 for BIPOC Vermonters.
8 (7)(A) Property ownership rates for the BIPOC community in the State
9 continue to remain stagnant.
10 (B) In a 2019 equity report, Burlington city officials found that
11 BIPOC own only four percent of the homes there, though they make up
12 18 percent of the city’s population.
13 (C) Furthermore, Black Burlingtonians are four times as likely to be
14 denied for a home loan as a White counterpart.
15 (D) This is a direct result of the wealth gap between the BIPOC
16 community and their White counterparts.
17 (8) The median household income for a Black Vermonter is $41,533.00
18 compared to $58,244.00 for their White counterparts.
19 (9) Nearly 24 percent of Black Vermonters live in poverty compared to
20 nearly 11 percent of White Vermonters.

1 Sec. 3. PURPOSE
2 The purpose of this act is to invest in systems of economic advancement
3 and cultural empowerment as a way to move towards greater racial and social
4 equity in wealth distribution, health, resilience, and economic and cultural
5 prosperity.

7 § 3. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT; PRINCIPLES; REVIEW AND
8 ASSESSMENT
9 (a) For purposes of the Vermont Statutes Annotated and State economic
10 development programs and assistance, “economic development” means the
11 process of generating economic wealth and vitality, security, and opportunity
12 for all Vermonters.
13 (b) There are established the following four five interrelated principles for
14 future economic development in Vermont:
15 (1) Vermont’s businesses, educators, nongovernmental organizations,
16 and government form a collaborative partnership that results in a highly skilled
17 multigenerational workforce to support and enhance business vitality and
18 individual prosperity.
19 (2) Vermont invests in its digital, physical, and human infrastructure as
20 the foundation for all economic development.
VT LEG #380683 v.1

2025 Page 12 of 19
1 (3) Vermont State government takes advantage of its small scale to
2 create nimble, efficient, and effective policies and regulations that support
3 business growth and the economic prosperity of all Vermonters.
4 (4) Vermont leverages its brand and scale to encourage a diverse
5 economy that reflects and capitalizes on our rural character, entrepreneurial
6 people, and reputation for environmental quality.
7 (5) Vermont embraces its responsibility to course correct the historical
8 impact of economic exploitation and exclusion from opportunity due to race
9 and ethnicity for American descendants of slavery and the broader Black,
10 Indigenous, and other Persons of Color community.
11 (c) The four five principles shall be used to guide the design and
12 implementation of each economic development program, policy, or initiative
13 that is sponsored or financially supported by the State, its subdivisions,
14 agencies, authorities, or private partners.

14 (3) The relationship between all persons and the land has been used to
15 oppress persons over the past several centuries.
16 (4) The laws and policies of our State and nation severed Indigenous
17 persons from their land while denying them, Black persons, and other persons
18 of color from having the opportunity to access and own land.
19 (5) These actions of the State led to systemic racism that has impacted
20 all Vermonters who have historically suffered from discrimination and who
21 have not had equal access to public or private economic benefits due to race,
VT LEG #380683 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.451
2025 Page 3 of 19
1 ethnicity, sex, geography, language preference, immigrant or citizen status,
2 sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, or disability status.
3 (6) The actions of the State have led to the erasure or appropriation of
4 culture for the descendants of slaves and Indigenous persons.
5 (f)(1) In order to offer repair for the systemic discrimination faced by many
6 persons throughout the State over the past four centuries, the State of Vermont
7 must engage in a just transition to an economic system that systemically
8 undoes racism instead of reinforcing it.
9 (2) Efforts to remedy wealth disparity in the United States have
10 traditionally looked to the free market, extractive economy for solutions to the
11 very problem that it has created.
12 (3) However, there has been increased recognition that improving access
13 to economic opportunity and cultural empowerment will require broader
14 approaches.
15 (4) In order to rectify this history of inequity, we must create economic
16 opportunity and cultural empowerment, using new systems that empower and
17 center Vermonters who have historically suffered from discrimination and who
18 have not had equal access to public or private economic benefits due to race,
19 ethnicity, sex, geography, language preference, immigrant or citizen status,
20 sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, or disability status.

1 (g) It is therefore the intent of the General Assembly to acknowledge and
2 address wealth disparity and cultural disempowerment by creating economic
3 opportunity and cultural empowerment for Vermonters who have historically
4 suffered from discrimination and who have not had equal access to public or
5 private economic benefits due to race, ethnicity, sex, geography, language
6 preference, immigrant or citizen status, sexual orientation, gender identity,
7 socioeconomic status, or disability status by ensuring equal access to economic
8 advancement and cultural reconstruction in the State of Vermont.
9 (h) In addition to the actions taken by this act, the State must engage in a
10 deep process of truth and reconciliation, guided by the persons who have been
11 most impacted, to address the underlying wounds of colonization and slavery.
12 Sec. 2. FINDINGS
13 (a) Definitions. As used in this section:
14 (1) “Non-White” means Black, Indigenous, and other Persons of Color
15 (BIPOC). The term is not intended to reflect self-identity but rather how
16 persons are categorized in the racial caste system on which discrimination has
17 been historically based in the United States. This term is used in this act
18 because currently Vermont typically disaggregates data solely by White and
19 non-White.
20 (2) “Race and ethnicity” means the categories for classifying individuals
21 that have been created by prevailing social perceptions, historical policies, and
VT LEG #380683 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.451
2025 Page 5 of 19
1 practices. The term includes how individuals perceive themselves and how
2 individuals are perceived by others.
3 (b) Wealth disparity in Vermont. Concerning the history of wealth
4 disparity in Vermont, the General Assembly finds:
5 (1) History, research, and experience demonstrate that Vermont
6 residents experience barriers to the equal enjoyment and benefit of economic
7 opportunity and cultural empowerment based on race and ethnicity.
8 (2) The United States was founded as a country on a triangular
9 relationship between settlers, native persons, and slaves.
10 (3) This structure created an inequity for wealth, economic resources,
11 cultural empowerment, homeownership, and land access through systemic
12 oppression and systematic racism for those who were defined as native or
13 slave.
14 (4) Prior to Vermont self-declaring its occupation of the land in 1777, it
15 is estimated that at least 10,000 Indigenous persons were living in the region,
16 specifically upwards of 4,000 Abenaki living in the Champlain Valley.
17 (5) Centuries of genocide, eugenics, broken treaties, displacement, and
18 land dispossession placed persons of the Abenaki Nations and other
19 Indigenous persons living in Vermont at a great social disadvantage.
20 (6) Although the original Vermont Constitution abolished slavery in this
21 State, with two exception clauses, it took until 1854 for African Americans to
VT LEG #380683 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.451
2025 Page 6 of 19
1 be considered legally free and not considered as property in the State, and not
2 until 1863 were African Americans federally recognized as free from
3 enslavement.
4 (7) During and since these early days of colonization and slavery, due to
5 local, State, and federal policies that were intentionally developed to
6 economically, socially, and racially discriminate against members of the
7 BIPOC community, multigenerational poverty has created a disturbing
8 disproportionate wealth gap for land and home ownership in what we now
9 know as Vermont and the United States.
10 (8) Federal land policies and programs denied members of the BIPOC
11 community farmland ownership opportunities that were available to their
12 White counterparts.
13 (9) The federal government’s creation of early land use policies, such as
14 those adopted under President Andrew Johnson, who overturned the infamous
15 “40 acres and a mule” and implemented “states’ rights” based reconstruction
16 policies, resulted in sharecropping.
17 (10) Sharecropping was the federal government prohibiting Black
18 farmers from owning property, and as a result, they were forced to rent land
19 from White landlords. Reconstruction policies resulted in sharecropping and
20 prohibiting Black farmers from owning property, and as a result, they were
VT LEG #380683 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.451
2025 Page 7 of 19
1 forced to rent land from White landlords. Many Black farmers at this time
2 experienced unfair terms and agreements.
3 (11) The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Farm Service
4 Agency (FSA) Loan Distribution Program has made it difficult for Black and
5 other persons of color to own farmland.
6 (12) In 1910, it was reported that 14 percent of all farm owner operators
7 in the United States were Black or African American. By 2012, they
8 comprised only 1.5 percent of farm owners across the country.
9 (13) Redlining was the practice of denying bank loans for mortgages to
10 Black and other persons of color, and it was used to segregate Black and other
11 communities of color into inner city neighborhoods. Redlining has drastically
12 impacted members of the BIPOC community for generations and has further
13 withheld generational wealth from the Black communities.
14 (14) The Housing and Urban Development’s Home Owners’ Loan
15 Corporation (HOLC) program denied Black and brown residents’ equal access
16 to home mortgages, often offering subprime loans that came with unusually
17 severe terms.
18 (15) Funds from the GI Bill intended to insure private mortgages, reduce
19 down payments, and cover tuition were only made available to White veterans,
20 denying BIPOC veterans access to wealth, land, and home ownership thus
21 denying them access to the economic opportunity of generational wealth.

2025 Page 8 of 19
1 (16) Despite amendments to the U.S. Constitution and the 1866 Civil
2 Rights Act, systemic racism, within both Vermont’s housing and agricultural
3 sectors, remains prevalent today.
4 (17) On July 16, 2020, Burlington, Vermont, took the bold move to
5 declare racism as a public health emergency, citing that only four percent of
6 the homes owned in Burlington were owned by persons of color while making
7 up 18 percent of the population and that they were four and a half times as
8 likely to be denied for a home loan compared to applicants who are White.
9 (18) Housing disparity and land access may increase with COVID-19,
10 advancing the triple threats of oppression—racism, classism, and sexism—in
11 the State.
12 (19) Without adequate access to land and home ownership, BIPOC are
13 forced to live in multigenerational housing, placing them at higher risk to
14 COVID-19 exposure.
15 (20) Nearly a quarter of Black Vermonters live in poverty, compared
16 with 11 percent of Vermonters overall. However, poverty rates for the BIPOC
17 community exceeded the State average in 2018. Poverty rates were also
18 greater among persons who include themselves in two or more racial groups or
19 identified as American Indian or of Hispanic or Latino origin.
20 (c) Concerning the connection among health, wealth, and property
21 ownership, the General Assembly finds:
VT LEG #380683 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.451
2025 Page 9 of 19
1 (1) Food insecurity rates are higher for members of the BIPOC
2 community who reside in the State of Vermont than their White neighbors.
3 (2) During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was estimated by the University
4 of Vermont that 49 percent of BIPOC households in the State experienced food
5 insecurity compared to 25.2 percent of White households. Food insecurity has
6 been linked to and known to cause mental health problems and depression,
7 hypertension and hyperlipidemia, worse outcomes on health exams, being in
8 poor or fair health, poor sleep, and obesity.
9 (3) According to the 2018 Vermont Department of Health’s Behavioral
10 Risk Factor Surveillance System report, non-White Vermonters are:
11 (A) statistically less likely to have a personal doctor;
12 (B) statistically more likely to report poor mental health;
13 (C) more than twice as likely to report rarely or never getting the
14 emotional and social support they need;
15 (D) significantly more likely to have depression;
16 (E) significantly more likely to have been worried about having
17 enough food in the past year; and
18 (F) significantly more likely to report no leisure-time physical
19 activity.
20 (4) The average age is 33 for BIPOC Vermonters, versus 46 for
21 Vermonters who are White.
VT LEG #380683 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.451
2025 Page 10 of 19
1 (5) BIPOC Vermonters are at a higher risk for more serious health
2 outcomes, such as hospitalization.
3 (6) Although there are not statistically significant differences in the rates
4 of pre-existing conditions, including diabetes, lung disease, and cardiovascular
5 disease, among all Vermonters, there are disparities in rates of pre-existing
6 conditions among COVID-19 cases. The pre-existing conditions rate among
7 COVID-19 cases is 19.4 for BIPOC Vermonters.
8 (7)(A) Property ownership rates for the BIPOC community in the State
9 continue to remain stagnant.
10 (B) In a 2019 equity report, Burlington city officials found that
11 BIPOC own only four percent of the homes there, though they make up
12 18 percent of the city’s population.
13 (C) Furthermore, Black Burlingtonians are four times as likely to be
14 denied for a home loan as a White counterpart.
15 (D) This is a direct result of the wealth gap between the BIPOC
16 community and their White counterparts.
17 (8) The median household income for a Black Vermonter is $41,533.00
18 compared to $58,244.00 for their White counterparts.
19 (9) Nearly 24 percent of Black Vermonters live in poverty compared to
20 nearly 11 percent of White Vermonters.

17 multigenerational workforce to support and enhance business vitality and
18 individual prosperity.
19 (2) Vermont invests in its digital, physical, and human infrastructure as
20 the foundation for all economic development.

1 (3) Vermont State government takes advantage of its small scale to
2 create nimble, efficient, and effective policies and regulations that support
3 business growth and the economic prosperity of all Vermonters.
4 (4) Vermont leverages its brand and scale to encourage a diverse
5 economy that reflects and capitalizes on our rural character, entrepreneurial
6 people, and reputation for environmental quality.
7 (5) Vermont embraces its responsibility to course correct the historical
8 impact of economic exploitation and exclusion from opportunity due to race
9 and ethnicity for American descendants of slavery and the broader Black,
10 Indigenous, and other Persons of Color community.
11 (c) The four five principles shall be used to guide the design and
12 implementation of each economic development program, policy, or initiative
13 that is sponsored or financially supported by the State, its subdivisions,
