3 Referred to Committee on
4 Date:
5 Subject: Human services; Medicaid; home-and community-based service
6 providers; designated and specialized service agencies
7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to require the
8 Secretary of Human Services to determine reasonable and adequate Medicaid
9 payment rates for providers of home-and community-based services. It would
10 direct the Secretary to adopt rules setting forth the methodology for those
11 payment rates, as well as for the Medicaid payment rates for designated and
12 specialized service agencies; the rules for all of these provider types would
13 need to include a process for determining an annual inflationary adjustment
14 and set forth a predictable timeline for redetermining the providers’ base rates.
15 The bill would require the Secretary to redetermine the payment rates for
16 home-and community-based service providers and for designated and
17 specialized service agencies at least annually and report those rates, and the
18 amounts necessary to fund them, to the General Assembly as part of the
19 Agency of Human Services’ budget presentation. The bill would also direct
20 the Department of Vermont Health Access to conduct a rate study of the
21 current Medicaid rates paid to providers of home-and community-based
