Act No. 14 (H.13). An act relating to Medicaid payment rates for community-based service
providers
Subjects: Medicaid; human services; community-based service providers;
designated and specialized service agencies
This act requires the Secretary of Human Services to calculate payment rates for
providers of community-based services in Vermont’s Medicaid program, including
designated and specialized service agencies, that are reasonable and adequate to achieve
the required outcomes for the populations they serve. It requires the Secretary to take
certain factors into account when calculating the rates and to establish a calculating
methodology that includes a schedule for conducting Medicaid rate studies, sets forth a
predictable timeline for redetermining base rates, and includes a process for calculating
an annual inflationary rate adjustment. The act directs the Secretary to recalculate the
payment rates for providers of community-based services at least annually and report
those rates and the cost of funding them to the General Assembly annually as part of the
Agency of Human Services’ budget presentation. It also directs the Secretary to establish
a process for providers to request provider stabilization from the Agency if they are at
imminent risk of closure. The act requires the Agency to provide an update on its
implementation of the act to the General Assembly on or before January 15, 2026.
