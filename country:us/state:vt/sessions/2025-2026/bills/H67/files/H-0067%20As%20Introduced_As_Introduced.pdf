6 Subject: Legislative operations; government accountability
7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to create the

10 Assembly and to update the legislative reports database.
11 An act relating to legislative operations and government accountability
12 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
13 * * * Purpose and Findings * * *
14 Sec. 1. PURPOSE
15 (a) The purpose of this act is to actuate the principle of government
16 accountability by focusing on how evidence is used to inform policy, how our
17 State laws are carried out, and how legislation can best be formed to achieve its
18 intended outcomes. This act strives to systematize government accountability
19 efforts as much as possible with simple, clear, independent, objective, and fact-

1 based processes rather than to rely upon individual legislators or individual
2 committees to be effective.
3 (b) Government accountability means the principle of demanding that
4 legislation succeeds in achieving its stated policy goals through the provision
5 of means by which to measure whether the policy goals have been met. The
6 metrics for determining whether success has been achieved are as important as
7 the goals themselves.
8 (c) Government oversight means the mechanisms put into place to ensure
9 that the bodies of government tasked with executing legislative intent are
10 properly doing so. Oversight by the General Assembly is the examination of
11 the processes followed and the information produced by government officials
12 executing the law to determine whether those officials are properly and
13 adequately achieving the policy goals established by the General Assembly.
