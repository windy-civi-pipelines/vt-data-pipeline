Whereas, nurses, the nation’s largest contingent of medical professionals, now
numbering 5.76 million, 4.91 million of whom are registered nurses and the remaining of
whom are practical nurses, have deservedly been described as “superheroes in
scrubs,” and
Whereas, their ubiquitous presence in hospitals, clinics, private offices, schools, and
other institutional settings attests to their essential role within the medical
community, and
Whereas, although many nurses remain primarily in support of supervising physicians,
in recent years, nurse practitioners, who complete advanced training programs, work
largely independently, and

Whereas, nurses’ dedication to healing is reconfirmed every day at thousands of
locations and by a multitude of individual patients regularly expressing their
appreciation, and
Whereas, a broader public recognition of the nursing profession’s place in the
American health care system began in October 1954, when the first National Nurses
Week was observed, coinciding with the centennial of nursing pioneer Florence
Nightingale’s Crimean War service, and
Whereas, in 1974, the International Council of Nurses (ICN) declared May 12 as
International Nurses Day, and that same year, President Richard Nixon signed a
proclamation recognizing National Nurse Week, and
Whereas, in 1982, the American Nurses Association (ANA) designated May 6 as
National Nurses Day and President Ronald Reagan signed a proclamation extending
public recognition to the observance, and
Whereas, in 1990, the ANA expanded the celebration to an entire week, creating
National Nurses Week, and May 6–12 became permanent in 1994, and within this special
week are National Student Nurse Day on May 8 and National School Nurse Day on the
Wednesday of the week, and
Whereas, in 2025, “The Power of Nurses” is the theme that the ANA has selected to
mark the week’s observance, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly recognizes the week of May 6–12 as National Nurses
Week in Vermont, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
ANA Vermont.
