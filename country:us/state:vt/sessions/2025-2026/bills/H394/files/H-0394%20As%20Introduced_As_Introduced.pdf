5 § 8010. SELF-GENERATION AND NET METERING
6 * * *
7 (c) In accordance with this section, the Commission shall adopt and

12 and the goals of 10 V.S.A. § 578 (greenhouse gas reduction) and is consistent
13 with the criteria of subsection 248(b) of this title;
14 (B) achieves a level of deployment of no less than 20 MW per year
15 and that is consistent with the recommendations of the Electrical Energy and

6 (F) This subdivision (F) applies to an application for a net metering
7 system with a capacity that is greater than 15 25 kilowatts, unless the system is
8 located on a new or existing structure the primary purpose of which is not the
9 generation of electricity. With respect to such a system, the rules shall not
10 waive or include provisions that are less stringent than each of the following:
11 (i) the requirement of subdivision 248(a)(4)(C) of this title to
12 provide a copy of the application to the Agencies of Agriculture, Food and

19 Sec. 3. 30 V.S.A. § 8002 (18) is amended to read:
20 (18) “Plant” means an independent technical facility that generates
21 electricity from renewable energy. A group of facilities, such as wind turbines,
VT LEG #379055 v.3

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.394
2025 Page 5 of 8
1 shall be considered one plant if the group is part of the same project and uses
2 common equipment and infrastructure such as roads, control facilities, and
3 connections to the electric grid. Common ownership, contiguity in time of
4 construction, and proximity of facilities to each other shall be relevant to
5 determining whether a group of facilities is part of the same project.
6 Independent technical facilities that are collocated on the same parcel shall not
7 be considered a single plant if each facility uses separate generators, inverters,
8 and production meters, as applicable, and each facility has a separate
9 interconnection point to the electric grid. An interconnection point is the point
10 at which the interconnection between the interconnecting utility’s electric
11 system and the renewable energy plant’s equipment interface occurs. Utility-
12 owned electric distribution and transmission lines shall not be considered part
13 of a plant or interconnection point. For purposes of eligibility in the net-
14 metering program under section 8010 of this chapter, collocated independent
15 technical facilities may not exceed a cumulative total of 500 kW in nameplate
16 capacity.

5 or held in at least one county in which any portion of the construction of the
6 facility is proposed to be located, or both. The Commission in its discretion
7 may hold a nonevidentiary public hearing in the absence of any request from a
8 member of the public or a party. From the comments made at a public hearing,
9 the Commission shall derive areas of inquiry that are relevant to the findings to
10 be made under this section and shall address each such area in its decision.
11 Prior to making findings, if the record does not contain evidence on such an
12 area, the Commission shall direct the parties to provide evidence on the area.
13 This subdivision (4) does not require the Commission to respond to each
14 individual comment.
