Union High School Chieftains Division III championship boys’ soccer team.
(H.C.R.34)
Offered by Representatives Charlton of Chester, Coffin of Cavendish, Morrow of
Weston, and Winter of Ludlow
Offered by Senators Clarkson, Major, and White
Whereas, the high caliber of the boys’ soccer team at Green Mountain Union High
School is reflected in the Chieftains earning a Division III championship game berth for
four of the past six years, and
Whereas, despite their strong athletic performance in recent years, the coveted
divisional crown had eluded the team, and the third-seeded 2024 squad was determined to
return home victorious from the pivotal contest played at Rutland’s Alumni Field against
the top-seeded Stowe High School Raiders, and
Whereas, the outlook for the Chieftains was initially problematic as the Raiders scored
first at 7:18 into the first half, and a chaotic scene at the goal line following Green
Mountain’s first attempt to score created the conditions for a successful second attempt,
and in the second half, Green Mountain broke the midgame tie, scoring with 21:12
remaining in regulation play, only to watch Stowe score its second goal at the 18:30
mark, and
Whereas, the perseverance of Green Mountain (17–1 for the year) was richly rewarded
when the team scored the winning goal at 10:32 into overtime, sending the joyous
Chieftains’ Mason Parker, Rasmuz Backlund, Andrei Solzhentisyn, Caleb Merrow, Max
Peebles, Sawyer Shepard, Ryan Jenkins, Andrew Alexander, Mason Cassidy, Logan
Williams, Collin Rose, Theo Schilling, Joachim Gibson, Logan Knight, Seth Pelkey,
Caden Spittle, Derek Hodgdon, Evan Kirdzik, Tanner Swisher, Reece Cassin, and Wyatt
Koch home as members of the winning team, and
Whereas, Head Coach Jake Walker and assistant coaches Scott Walker and Justin
Veysey were proud of the players’ great scoring and goalkeeping efforts, now
therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2024 Green Mountain Union High
School Chieftains Division III championship boys’ soccer team, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Green Mountain Union High School.
