Offered by Senators Clarkson, Major, and White
House concurrent resolution congratulating the 2024 Green Mountain Union High School Chieftains
Division III championship boys’ soccer team
Whereas, the high caliber of the boys’ soccer team at Green Mountain Union High School is reflected in the
Chieftains earning a Division III championship game berth for four of the past sixyears, and
Whereas, despite their strong athletic performance in recent years, the coveted divisional crown had eluded
the team, and the third-seeded 2024 squad was determined to return home victorious from the pivotal contest
played at Rutland’s Alumni Field against the top-seeded Stowe High School Raiders, and
Whereas, the outlook for the Chieftains was initially problematic as the Raiders scored first at 7:18 into the
first half, and a chaotic scene at the goal line following Green Mountain’s first attempt to score created the
conditions for a successful second attempt, and in the second half, Green Mountain broke the midgame tie,
scoring with 21:12 remaining in regulation play, only to watch Stowe score its second goal at the 18:30
mark, and
Whereas, the perseverance of Green Mountain (17–1 for the year) was richly rewarded when the team scored
the winning goal at 10:32 into overtime, sending the joyous Chieftains’ Mason Parker, Rasmuz Backlund,
Andrei Solzhentisyn, Caleb Merrow, MaxPeebles, Sawyer Shepard, Ryan Jenkins, Andrew Alexander, Mason
Cassidy, Logan Williams, Collin Rose, Theo Schilling, Joachim Gibson, Logan Knight, Seth Pelkey, Caden
Spittle, Derek Hodgdon, Evan Kirdzik, Tanner Swisher, Reece Cassin, and Wyatt Koch home as members of
the winning team, and
Whereas, Head Coach Jake Walker and assistant coaches Scott Walker and Justin Veysey were proud of the
players’ great scoring and goalkeeping efforts, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2024 Green Mountain Union High School Chieftains Division
III championship boys’ soccer team, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to Green Mountain Union
High School.
