6 (a) In matters within its authority, the Board shall have concurrent,
7 appellate jurisdiction with the Superior Court. Any party seeking to appeal a
8 municipal zoning decision on a housing project shall bring the appeal to the
9 Board. The decision to bring an appeal before the Board shall be deemed a
10 waiver of any right to bring an action in the Superior Court but shall not
11 abrogate any party’s right to appeal decisions of the Board to the Supreme
12 Court; as such, the Board shall retain jurisdiction of any matter originally
13 brought before it. At any time during an appeal to the Board, if the Board
14 determines that it does not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal, the appellant
15 shall have 30 days to file an appeal with the Superior Court.

17 any claim that is within the Board’s authority and that has previously been or is
18 subsequently included in an appeal in Superior Court by another party to the
19 decision or by any other aggrieved or injured party who can demonstrate legal
20 standing to appeal shall automatically be stayed by the court to provide the
21 party with standing the opportunity to intervene in the matter before the Board.
VT LEG #379302 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.42
2025 Page 6 of 12
1 If intervenor status is granted, the stay of the court action regarding those
2 claims shall continue during the pendency of the appeal to the Board. After the
3 Board has decided the appeal, the court shall dismiss the matter before it to the
4 extent the matter has been resolved by the Board. Any claim included in an
5 appeal to Superior Court that is not within the Board’s authority shall not be
6 subject to automatic stay by the court.
7 (c) Appeals shall be filed with the Board within 30 days following the final
8 decision of the appropriate municipal panel. At the same time an appeal is
9 filed with the Board, the applicant shall notify the appropriate municipal panel
10 of the appeal.

12 of notice of appeal submit to the Board a certified record of its proceedings on
13 the matter subject to the appeal.

15 any hearing upon all parties at least 20 days prior to the date of the hearing.

2 will be introduced. The rules of evidence shall not strictly apply. The Board
3 shall record the proceedings of any hearing before it and shall make such
4 recording available to the public for inspection and recording from the date of
5 the hearing to a date that is 15 working days after the Board has made a final
6 decision on the matter that is the subject of the hearing or, if an appeal is made
7 from such decision, the date upon which the matter has been finally
8 adjudicated, whichever date is later.
9 (i) The Board shall not reverse or modify a decision except for errors of
10 law or if the Board is persuaded by the balance of probabilities, on the
11 evidence before it, that said decision is unreasonable.
12 (j) Nonattorneys, including professional engineers, architects, and land
13 surveyors, may represent any party before the Board. Nothing in this section
14 shall prevent the Board from denying representation by any individual it deems
15 to be improper, inappropriate, or unable to adequately represent the interests of
16 the applicant.
17 (k) The Board’s deliberative processes in adjudicatory proceedings shall be
18 exempt from the public meeting and notice provisions of 1 V.S.A. chapter 5.
