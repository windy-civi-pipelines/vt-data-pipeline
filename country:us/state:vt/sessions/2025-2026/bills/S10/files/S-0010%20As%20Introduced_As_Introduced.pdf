12 (c) In the case of a project that requires a certificate of need under this
13 section, expenditures for which are anticipated to be in excess of
14 $30,000,000.00 $100,000,000.00, the applicant first shall secure a conceptual
15 development phase certificate of need, in accordance with the standards and
16 procedures established in this subchapter, that permits the applicant to make
17 expenditures for architectural services, engineering design services, or any
18 other planning services, as defined by the Board, needed in connection with the
19 project. Upon completion of the conceptual development phase of the project,
20 and before offering or further developing the project, the applicant shall secure

1 established in this subchapter. Applicants shall not be subject to sanctions for
2 failure to comply with the provisions of this subsection if such failure is solely
3 the result of good faith reliance on verified project cost estimates issued by
4 qualified persons, which cost estimates would have led a reasonable person to
5 conclude the project was not anticipated to be in excess of $30,000,000.00
6 $100,000,000.00 and therefore not subject to this subsection. The provisions
7 of this subsection notwithstanding, expenditures may be made in preparation

11 (d) If the Board determines that a person required to obtain a certificate of
12 need under this subchapter has separated a single project into components in
13 order to avoid cost thresholds or other requirements under this subchapter, the
14 person shall be required to submit an application for a certificate of need for
15 the entire project, and the Board may proceed under section 9445 of this title.
16 The Board’s determination under this subsection shall have the effect of a final
17 decision and is subject to appeal under section 9381 of this title.
18 (e) The Board may periodically shall adjust the monetary jurisdictional
19 thresholds contained in this section. In doing so, the Board shall reflect the
20 same categories of health care facilities, services, and programs recognized in
21 this section. Any adjustment by the Board shall not exceed an amount
