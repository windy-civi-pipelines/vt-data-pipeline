2 Compact that is enacted by other compact party states.
3 § 3041b. PURPOSE
4 The purpose of this compact is to facilitate the interstate practice of
5 school psychology in educational or school settings and, in so doing, to
6 improve the availability of school psychological services to the public.
7 This compact is intended to establish a pathway to allow school
8 psychologists to obtain equivalent licenses to provide school psychological
9 services in any member state. In this way, this compact shall enable the
10 member states to ensure that safe and effective school psychological
11 services are available and delivered by appropriately qualified
12 professionals in their educational settings. To facilitate the objectives
13 described in this section, this compact:
14 (1) enables school psychologists who qualify for receipt of an
15 equivalent license to practice in other member states without first
16 satisfying burdensome and duplicative requirements;
17 (2) promotes the mobility of school psychologists between and
18 among the member states in order to address workforce shortages and to
19 ensure that safe and reliable school psychological services are available in
20 each member state;
21 (3) enhances the public accessibility of school psychological
VT LEG #380620 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.325

1 services by increasing the availability of qualified, licensed school
2 psychologists through the establishment of an efficient and streamlined
3 pathway for licensees to practice in other member states;
4 (4) preserves and respects the authority of each member state to
5 protect the health and safety of its residents by ensuring that only qualified,
6 licensed professionals are authorized to provide school psychological
7 services within that state;
8 (5) requires school psychologists practicing within a member state
9 to comply with the scope of practice laws present in the state where the
10 school psychological services are being provided;
11 (6) promotes cooperation between the member states in regulating
12 the practice of school psychology within those states; and
13 (7) facilitates the relocation of military members and their spouses
14 who are licensed to provide school psychological services.

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.325
2025 Page 26 of 35
1 (b) The Commission shall promulgate reasonable rules to achieve the
2 intent and purpose of this interstate compact. In the event the Commission
3 exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond purpose and
4 intent of this interstate compact, or the powers granted hereunder, then such
5 an action by the Commission shall be invalid and have no force and effect of
6 law in the member states.
7 (c) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule, by
8 enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the
9 compact within four years of the date of adoption of the rule, then such rule
10 shall have no further force and effect in any member state.
11 (d) Rules or amendments to the rules shall be adopted or ratified at a
12 regular or special meeting of the Commission in accordance with
13 Commission rules and bylaws.

VT LEG #380620 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.325
2025 Page 27 of 35
1 (2) on the website of each member state licensing authority or other

3 otherwise publish proposed rules.
4 (f) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may
5 consider and adopt an emergency rule with 48 hours’ notice, with opportunity
6 to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures shall be
7 retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event
8 later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this

11 (1) meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
12 (2) prevent a loss of Commission or member state funds;

2025 Page 28 of 35
1 (2) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
2 Commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent
3 jurisdiction where the principal office of the Commission is located. The

6 Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any
7 action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such
8 similar matter.
9 (3) The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in
10 any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact and
11 shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure
12 to provide the Commission service of process shall render a judgment or order
13 void as to the Commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.
14 (b) Default, technical assistance, and termination.
15 (1) If the Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in
16 the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or

4 be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a supermajority
5 of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges and benefits
6 conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective
7 date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending
8 state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
9 (d) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only
10 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of
11 intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the

13 legislature, the defaulting state’s licensing authority, and each of the
14 member states’ licensing authorities.

16 obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination,
17 including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.
18 (f) Upon the termination of a state’s membership from this compact, that
19 state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state of
20 such termination. The terminated state shall continue to recognize all
21 licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of six months after

6 petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal

8 shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s
9 fees.
10 (i) Dispute resolution.

12 resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and

18 legal action against a member state in default in the U. S. District Court for
19 the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
20 principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact
21 and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive
VT LEG #380620 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.325
2025 Page 31 of 35
1 relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the
2 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
3 reasonable attorney’s fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive
4 remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other
5 remedies available under federal or the defaulting member state’s law.
6 (2) A member state may initiate legal action against the Commission
7 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district
8 where the Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with
9 the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought
10 may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
11 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
12 such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
13 (3) No person other than a member state shall enforce this compact
14 against the Commission.

17 compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state.

20 charter member states to determine if the statute enacted by each such
VT LEG #380620 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.325
2025 Page 32 of 35
1 charter member state is materially different than the model compact
2 statute.
3 (A) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be
4 materially different from the model compact statute shall be entitled to
5 the default process set forth in section 3041k of this title.
6 (B) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is
7 terminated or withdraws from the compact, the Commission shall
8 remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if the
9 number of member states should be fewer than seven.
10 (2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the charter
11 member states shall be subject to the process set forth in subdivision
12 3041(c)(21) of this title to determine if their enactments are materially
13 different from the model compact statute and whether they qualify for
14 participation in the compact.
15 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in
16 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to
17 the effective date of the compact or the Commission coming into
18 existence shall be considered to be actions of the Commission unless

20 (A) Any State that joins the compact subsequent to the

12 effective date of withdrawal.
13 (d) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact,

VT LEG #380620 v.1

2025 Page 34 of 35
1 arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does
2 not conflict with the provisions of this compact.
3 (2) This compact may be amended by the member states. No

6 § 3041m. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
7 (a) This compact and the Commission’s rulemaking authority shall be
8 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation

10 authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to
11 limit the Commission’s rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
12 (b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase,
13 clause, sentence or provision of this compact is held by a court of competent
14 jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, a state
15 seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the
16 applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.325
2025 Page 35 of 35
1 requirements of subsection 3041k(b) of this title, terminate a member state’s
2 participation in the compact if it determines that a constitutional requirement
3 of a member state is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if
4 this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member
5 state, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining
6 member states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as
7 to all severable matters.
8 § 3041n. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE
9 LAWS
10 (a) Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law
11 of a member state that is not inconsistent with the compact.

13 state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.

6 improve the availability of school psychological services to the public.

8 psychologists to obtain equivalent licenses to provide school psychological
9 services in any member state. In this way, this compact shall enable the

11 services are available and delivered by appropriately qualified
12 professionals in their educational settings. To facilitate the objectives
13 described in this section, this compact:
14 (1) enables school psychologists who qualify for receipt of an
15 equivalent license to practice in other member states without first
16 satisfying burdensome and duplicative requirements;
17 (2) promotes the mobility of school psychologists between and

9 to comply with the scope of practice laws present in the state where the
10 school psychological services are being provided;

4 be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a supermajority
5 of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges and benefits
6 conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective
7 date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending
8 state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
9 (d) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only
10 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of
11 intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the
12 governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s
13 legislature, the defaulting state’s licensing authority, and each of the
14 member states’ licensing authorities.
15 (e) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments,
16 obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination,
17 including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.
18 (f) Upon the termination of a state’s membership from this compact, that
19 state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state of
20 such termination. The terminated state shall continue to recognize all
21 licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of six months after

3 found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact unless
4 agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting state.
5 (h) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by
6 petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal
7 district where the Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party
8 shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s
9 fees.
10 (i) Dispute resolution.
11 (1) Upon request by a member state, the Commission shall attempt to
12 resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and
13 between member and non-member states.
14 (2) The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both
15 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
16 (j) Enforcement.
17 (1) By majority vote as provided by rule, the Commission may initiate
18 legal action against a member state in default in the U. S. District Court for
19 the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
20 principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact
21 and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.325
2025 Page 31 of 35
1 relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the
2 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
3 reasonable attorney’s fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive
4 remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other
5 remedies available under federal or the defaulting member state’s law.
6 (2) A member state may initiate legal action against the Commission
7 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district
8 where the Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with
9 the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought
10 may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
11 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
12 such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
13 (3) No person other than a member state shall enforce this compact
14 against the Commission.
15 § 3041l. EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
16 (a) The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the
17 compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state.

VT LEG #380620 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.325
2025 Page 32 of 35
1 charter member state is materially different than the model compact
2 statute.
3 (A) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be
4 materially different from the model compact statute shall be entitled to
5 the default process set forth in section 3041k of this title.
6 (B) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is
7 terminated or withdraws from the compact, the Commission shall
8 remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if the
9 number of member states should be fewer than seven.
10 (2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the charter
11 member states shall be subject to the process set forth in subdivision
12 3041(c)(21) of this title to determine if their enactments are materially
13 different from the model compact statute and whether they qualify for
14 participation in the compact.
15 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in
16 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to
17 the effective date of the compact or the Commission coming into
18 existence shall be considered to be actions of the Commission unless

VT LEG #380620 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.325
2025 Page 33 of 35
1 to the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the compact

12 effective date of withdrawal.
13 (d) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact,
14 a state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all
15 licensees within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory

18 of six months after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
19 (1) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to

VT LEG #380620 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.325
2025 Page 34 of 35
1 arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does
2 not conflict with the provisions of this compact.
3 (2) This compact may be amended by the member states. No
4 amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon
5 any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
6 § 3041m. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
7 (a) This compact and the Commission’s rulemaking authority shall be
8 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation
9 and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact expressly
10 authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to
11 limit the Commission’s rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
12 (b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase,
13 clause, sentence or provision of this compact is held by a court of competent
14 jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, a state
15 seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the
16 applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is
17 held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
18 of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other
19 government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
20 (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, the Commission may
21 deny a state’s participation in the compact or, in accordance with the
VT LEG #380620 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.325
2025 Page 35 of 35
1 requirements of subsection 3041k(b) of this title, terminate a member state’s
2 participation in the compact if it determines that a constitutional requirement
3 of a member state is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if
4 this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member
5 state, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining
6 member states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as
7 to all severable matters.
8 § 3041n. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE
9 LAWS
10 (a) Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law
11 of a member state that is not inconsistent with the compact.
12 (b) Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a member
13 state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
14 (c) All permissible agreements between the Commission and the member
15 states are binding in accordance with their terms.
