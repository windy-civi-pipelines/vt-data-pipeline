11 forth in this section.
12 (b) Approved independent schools. On application, the State Board shall
13 approve an independent school that offers elementary or secondary education
14 if it finds, after opportunity for hearing, that the school provides a minimum
15 course of study pursuant to section 906 of this title and that it substantially
16 complies with all statutory requirements for approved independent schools and
17 the Board’s rules for approved independent schools. An independent school
18 that intends to accept public tuition shall be approved by the State Board only
19 on the condition that the school agrees, notwithstanding any provision of law
20 to the contrary, to enroll any student who requires special education services
21 and who is placed in or referred to the approved independent school as an
VT LEG #379058 v.3

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.122
2025 Page 10 of 32
1 appropriate placement and least restrictive environment for the student by the
2 student’s individualized education program team or by the local education
3 agency; provided, however, that this requirement shall not apply to an
4 independent school that limits enrollment to students who are on an
5 individualized education program or a plan under Section 504 of the
6 Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and who are enrolled pursuant to
7 a written agreement between the local education agency and the school.
8 Except as provided in subdivision (6) of this subsection, the Board’s rules must
9 at minimum require that the school have the resources required to meet its
10 stated objectives, including financial capacity, faculty who are qualified by
11 training and experience in the areas in which they are assigned, and physical
12 facilities and special services that are in accordance with any State or federal
13 law or regulation. Approval may be granted without State Board evaluation in
14 the case of any school accredited by a private, State, or regional agency
15 recognized by the State Board for accrediting purposes, provided that the State
16 Board shall determine that the school complies with all student enrollment
17 provisions required by law.
18 (1) On application, the State Board shall approve an independent school

VT LEG #379058 v.3

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.122
2025 Page 11 of 32

2 buildings in which kindergartens are conducted but shall consider all findings
3 and recommendations of any such agency in making its approval decision.
4 (2) Approvals under this subsection (b) shall be for a term established
5 by rule of the Board but not greater than five years.
6 (3) An approved independent school shall provide to the parent or
7 guardian responsible for each of its students, prior to accepting any money for
8 a student, an accurate statement in writing of its status under this section and a
9 copy of this section. Failure to comply with this provision may create a
10 permissible inference of false advertising in violation of 13 V.S.A. § 2005.
11 (4) Each approved independent school shall provide to the Secretary on
12 October 1 of each year the names, genders, dates of birth, and addresses of its
13 enrolled students. Within seven days of the termination of a student’s
14 enrollment, the approved independent school shall notify the Secretary of the
15 name and address of the student. The Secretary shall notify the appropriate
16 school officials as provided in section 1126 of this title.
17 (5) The State Board may revoke, suspend, or impose conditions upon
18 the approval of an approved independent school, after having provided an
19 opportunity for a hearing, for substantial failure to comply with the minimum
20 course of study, for failure to demonstrate that the school has the resources
21 required to meet its stated objectives, for failure to comply with statutory
VT LEG #379058 v.3

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.122
2025 Page 12 of 32
1 requirements or the Board’s rules for approved independent schools, or for
2 failure to report under subdivision (4) of this subsection (b). Upon that
3 revocation or suspension, students required to attend school who are enrolled
4 in that school shall become truant unless they enroll in a public school, an
5 approved or recognized independent school, or a home study program.
6 (6) This subdivision (6) applies to an independent school located in
7 Vermont that offers a distance learning program and that, because of its
8 structure, does not meet some or all the rules of the State Board for approved
9 independent schools. In order to be approved under this subdivision, a school
10 shall meet the standards adopted by rule of the State Board for approved
11 independent schools that can be applied to the applicant school and any other
12 standards or rules adopted by the State Board regarding these types of schools.
13 A school approved under this subdivision shall not be eligible to receive tuition
14 payments from public school districts under chapter 21 of this title.
15 (7) Approval for independent residential schools under this subsection is
16 also contingent upon proof of the school’s satisfactory completion of an annual
17 fire safety inspection by the Department of Public Safety or its designee
18 pursuant to 20 V.S.A. chapter 173, subchapter 2. A certificate executed by the
19 inspecting entity, declaring satisfactory completion of the inspection and
20 identifying the date by which a new inspection must occur, shall be posted at
21 the school in a public location. The school shall provide a copy of the
VT LEG #379058 v.3

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.122
2025 Page 13 of 32
1 certificate to the Secretary of Education after each annual inspection. The
2 school shall pay the actual cost of the inspection unless waived or reduced by
3 the inspecting entity.
4 (8)(A) If an approved independent school experiences any of the
5 following financial reporting events during the period of its approved status,
6 the school shall notify the Secretary of Education within five days after its
7 knowledge of the event unless the failure is de minimis:
8 (i) the school’s failure to file its federal or State tax returns when
9 due, after permissible extension periods have been taken into account;
10 (ii) the school’s failure to meet its payroll obligations as they are
11 due or to pay federal or State payroll tax obligations as they are due;
12 (iii) the school’s failure to maintain required retirement
13 contributions;
14 (iv) the school’s use of designated funds for nondesignated
15 purposes;
16 (v) the school’s inability to fully comply with the financial terms
17 of its secured installment debt obligations over a period of two consecutive
18 months, including the school’s failure to make interest or principal payments
19 as they are due or to maintain any required financial ratios;
VT LEG #379058 v.3

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.122
2025 Page 14 of 32
1 (vi) the withdrawal or conditioning of the school’s accreditation
2 on financial grounds by a private, State, or regional agency recognized by the
3 State Board for accrediting purposes; or
4 (vii) the school’s insolvency, as defined in 9 V.S.A. § 2286(a).
5 (B)(i) If the Secretary reasonably believes that an approved
6 independent school lacks financial capacity to meet its stated objectives during
7 the period of its approved status, then the Secretary shall notify the school in
8 writing of the reasons for this belief and permit the school a reasonable
9 opportunity to respond.
10 (ii) If the Secretary, after having provided the school a reasonable
11 opportunity to respond, does not find that the school has satisfactorily
12 responded or demonstrated its financial capacity, the Secretary may establish a
13 review team that, with the consent of the school, includes a member of the
14 Council of Independent Schools, to:
15 (I) conduct a school visit to assess the school’s financial
16 capacity;
17 (II) obtain from the school such financial documentation as the
18 review team requires to perform its assessment; and
19 (III) submit a report of its findings and recommendations to the
20 State Board.

2025 Page 15 of 32
1 (iii) If the State Board concludes that an approved independent
2 school lacks financial capacity to meet its stated objectives during the period of
3 its approved status, the State Board may take any action that is authorized by
4 this section.
5 (iv) In considering whether an independent school lacks financial
6 capacity to meet its stated objectives during the period of its approved status
7 and what actions the State Board should take if it makes this finding, the State
8 Board may consult with, and draw on the analytical resources of, the Vermont
9 Department of Financial Regulation.
10 (C) Information provided by an independent school under this
11 subsection that is not already in the public domain is exempt from public
12 inspection and copying under the Public Records Act and shall be kept
13 confidential. [Repealed.]
14 (c) Recognized independent schools. Upon filing an enrollment notice, a
15 recognized independent school may provide elementary or secondary
16 education in Vermont. The enrollment notice shall be on a form provided by
17 the Secretary and shall be filed with the Secretary no not earlier than three
18 months before the beginning of the school year for the public schools in the
19 town in which the applicant proposes to locate.
20 (1) The enrollment notice shall contain the following information and
21 assurances:
VT LEG #379058 v.3

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.122
2025 Page 16 of 32
1 (A) a statement that the school will be in session an amount of time
2 substantially equivalent to that required for public schools;
3 (B) a detailed description or outline of the minimum course of study
4 for each grade level the school offers and how the annual assessment of each
5 student will be performed; and
6 (C) assurances that:
7 (i) the school will prepare and maintain attendance records for
8 each student enrolled or regularly attending classes;
9 (ii) at least once each year, the school will assess each student’s
10 progress, and will maintain records of that assessment, and present the result of
11 that assessment to each student’s parent or guardian;
12 (iii) the school’s educational program will include the minimum
13 course of study set forth in section 906 of this title;
14 (iv) the school will have teachers and materials sufficient to carry
15 out the school’s educational program; and
16 (v) the school will meet such State and federal laws and
17 regulations concerning its physical facilities and health and safety matters as
18 are applicable to recognized independent schools.
19 (2) If the Secretary has information that creates significant doubt about
20 whether the school would be able to meet the requirements set forth in this
21 subsection (c), the Secretary may call a hearing. At the hearing, the school
VT LEG #379058 v.3

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.122
2025 Page 17 of 32
1 shall establish that it can meet the requirements for recognized independent
2 schools. Failure to do so shall result in a finding by the Secretary that the
3 school must take specified action to come into compliance within a specified
4 time frame or the children enrolled must attend another recognized
5 independent school, a public school, an approved independent school, or a
6 home study program, or be declared truant unless absent with legal excuse.
7 (3) A recognized independent school shall provide to each student’s
8 parent or guardian a copy of its currently filed statement of objectives and a
9 copy of this section. The copy shall be provided when the student enrolls or
10 before September 1, whichever comes later. Failure to comply with this
11 subsection may create a permissible inference of false advertising in violation
12 of 13 V.S.A. § 2005.
13 (4) A recognized independent school shall renew its enrollment notice
14 annually. An independent school shall be recognized for a period not to
15 exceed five years by the Secretary without need for filing an annual enrollment
16 notice if:
17 (A) it is recognized by an organization approved by the State Board
18 for the purpose of recognizing such school; or
19 (B) it is accredited by a private, state, or regional agency approved by
20 the State Board for accrediting purposes; provided, however, nothing in this
VT LEG #379058 v.3

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.122
2025 Page 18 of 32
1 subdivision (4) shall be construed to prohibit the Secretary from initiating a
2 hearing under this subsection (c).
3 (5) If the Secretary has information that creates significant doubt about
4 whether the school, once in operation, is meeting the requirements for
5 recognized independent schools, the Secretary may call a hearing. At the
6 hearing, the school shall establish that it has met the requirements for
7 recognized independent schools. Failure to do so shall result in a finding by
8 the Secretary that:
9 (A) the school may not be in operation for the remainder of the
10 school year and that the children are truant unless absent with legal excuse or
11 enrolled in a public school, an independent school, another recognized
12 independent school, or a home study program; or
13 (B) the school must take specified action to come into compliance
14 within a specified time frame or the school will not be permitted to operate for
15 the remainder of the school year.
16 (6) Each recognized independent school shall provide to the Secretary
17 on October 1 of each year the names, genders, dates of birth, and addresses of
18 its enrolled students. Within seven days of after the termination of a student’s
19 enrollment, the recognized independent school shall notify the Secretary of the
20 name and address of the student. The Secretary shall notify the appropriate
21 school officials as provided in section 1126 of this title.

1 (7) After the filing of the enrollment notice or at a hearing, if the school
2 is unable to comply with any specific requirements due to deep religious
3 conviction shared by an organized group, the Secretary may waive such
4 requirements if he or she the Secretary determines that the educational
5 purposes of this subsection are being or will be substantially met.
6 (d) Council of Independent Schools. A Council of Independent Schools is
7 created consisting of 11 members, no fewer than three of whom shall be
8 representatives of recognized independent schools. The Secretary shall
9 appoint nine members from within the independent schools’ community. The
10 Secretary shall appoint two members from the public-at-large. Each member
11 shall serve for two years and may be reappointed for up to an additional two
12 terms. The Council shall adopt rules for its own operation. A chair shall be
13 elected by and from among the members. The duties of the Council shall
14 include advising the Secretary on policies and procedures with respect to
15 independent schools. No hearing shall be initiated under this section before the
16 State Board or by the Secretary until the recommendations of the Council have
17 been sought and received. The recommendations of the Council, including any
18 minority reports, shall be admissible at the hearing.
19 (e) Harassment, hazing, and bullying policies. The board of trustees of an
20 approved or a recognized independent school operating in Vermont shall adopt
21 harassment, hazing, and bullying prevention policies; establish procedures for

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.122
2025 Page 20 of 32
1 dealing with harassment, hazing, and bullying of students; and provide notice
2 of these. The provisions of chapter 9, subchapter 5 of this title for public
3 schools shall apply to this subsection, except that the board shall follow its
4 own procedures for adopting policy.
5 (f) Tuition bills. An approved independent school A school eligible for
6 designation under section 820 of this title that accepts students for whom the
7 district of residence pays tuition under chapter 21 of this title shall bill the
8 sending district monthly for a State-placed student and shall not bill the
9 sending district for any month in which the State-placed student was not
10 enrolled.
11 (g) Tuition students; assessments. An approved independent school A
12 school eligible for designation under section 820 of this title that accepts
13 students for whom the district of residence pays tuition under chapter 21 of this
14 title shall use the assessment or assessments required under subdivision 164(9)
15 of this title to measure attainment of standards for student performance of
16 those students. In addition, the school shall provide data related to the
17 assessment or assessments as required by the Secretary.
