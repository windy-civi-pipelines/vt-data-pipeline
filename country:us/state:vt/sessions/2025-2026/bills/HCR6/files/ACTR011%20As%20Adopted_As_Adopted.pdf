Whereas, the vibrancy of Milton High School’s girls’ soccer program was
convincingly renewed during the fall 2024 season, as the top-ranked Yellowjackets (17–
1) proved their command of the pitch, and
Whereas, at the 2024 Division II championship game, played at Burlington’s Buck
Hard Field, the Yellowjackets exhibited commanding soccer prowess against the seventh-
seeded Mt. Abraham Union High School Eagles, scoring goals in the 15th minute of play
and then again with 17:36 remaining in regulation time to tally both the school’s 18th
divisional championship and 11th shutout this season, and
Whereas, the victorious Yellowjackets were Samantha Provost, Dasie May Gabree,
Sydney Greenfield, Cianna Tomasi, Kaitlyn Bombard, Molly St. Amand, Madison Rose,
Grace Dowling, Holley MacLellan, Callie Fougere, Lucy Spaulding, Taylor Shappy,
Savannah Monahan, Caitlyn Fortier, Antoinette Brynga, Emily Banacos, Avery Turner,
Hannah Smiley, Allessandra Hoffman, Lajla Pasic, Catherine Preuss, Marlie Bushey,
Logan Freeman, Lila Martin, and Lily Daunais, and
Whereas, Head Coach Caitlyn Fogel, assistant coaches Scott Tomasi and Rebecca
Brygna, and Team Manger Meghan Abare were all proud of Milton’s 2024 outstanding
girls’ soccer season, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2024 Milton High School Yellowjackets
girls’ soccer team on winning a second consecutive Division II championship, and be it
further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
