5 Subject: Conservation and development; solid waste; flood safety; wetlands;
6 dams
7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to amend
8 multiple environmental subjects. The bill would extend by a year the date by
9 which an assessment of the end-of-life management of certain battery types
10 shall be conducted and requires the battery stewardship organization in the
11 State to complete the assessment instead of the Agency of Natural Resources.
12 The bill also clarifies when a fuel dealer can deliver to a category one tank that
13 does not have a valid permit or otherwise may result in a release to the
14 environment. The bill would provide that information submitted to the
15 Department of Environmental Conservation under the Healthy Homes
16 Initiative shall be considered confidential. In addition, the bill would extend
17 multiple deadline dates for reporting or rulemaking for specific flood safety,
18 river corridor, wetlands, and dam programs.

12 The bill also clarifies when a fuel dealer can deliver to a category one tank that
13 does not have a valid permit or otherwise may result in a release to the
14 environment. The bill would provide that information submitted to the
15 Department of Environmental Conservation under the Healthy Homes
16 Initiative shall be considered confidential. In addition, the bill would extend
17 multiple deadline dates for reporting or rulemaking for specific flood safety,
18 river corridor, wetlands, and dam programs.
