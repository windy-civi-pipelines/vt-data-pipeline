6 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to require the

10 U.S. Constitution.

13 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
14 Sec. 1. SHORT TITLE
15 This act may be cited as the “Vermont Defend the Guard Act”.
16 Sec. 2. FINDINGS

1 (2) The Vermont National Guard plays a unique dual role, serving both
2 the State and federal functions, with State authority during peace time retained
3 under Title 32 of the United States Code.
4 (3) The federal government has increasingly circumvented
5 Congressional authority, engaging the National Guard units in combat
6 operations without formal Congressional declaration of war, undermining
7 constitutional principles.
8 (4) Vermont retains authority over its militia as a safeguard against
9 federal overreach, consistent with the 10th Amendment to the U.S.
10 Constitution.
11 (5) This act seeks to ensure Vermont’s Guard members are deployed in
12 accordance with constitutional requirements, preserving their safety and the
13 integrity of the law.
14 Sec. 3. 20 V.S.A. chapter 21 is amended to read:

11 purposes:
