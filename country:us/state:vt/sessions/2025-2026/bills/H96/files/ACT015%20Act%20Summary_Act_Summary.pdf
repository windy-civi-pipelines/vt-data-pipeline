need
Subjects: Health; Green Mountain Care Board; health care facilities; certificates of

adds new exclusions from CON requirements for fully depreciated medical equipment,
for ground ambulance services and emergency medical equipment and supplies, and for
new services or construction projects for facilities owned or operated by the State of
Vermont or funded by a contract or grant from the State of Vermont, although notice of a
new State-owned, -operated, or -funded service or project must be provided to the Green
Mountain Care Board.
