BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.96
2025 Page 3 of 12
1 by the Board, shall be considered together in calculating the amount of an

6 operating expense that exceeds $500,000.00 $10,000,000.00 for either of the

11 establishment or expansion of an ambulatory surgical center for which the cost
12 exceeds $10,000,000.00.
13 (b) A hospital shall not develop or have developed on its behalf a new
14 health care project without issuance of a certificate of need by the Board. For
15 purposes of this subsection, a “new health care project” includes the following:
16 (1) The construction, development, purchase, renovation, or other
17 establishment of a health care facility, or any capital expenditure by or on

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.96
2025 Page 4 of 12
1 of a donation the value, is in excess of $1,500,000.00 $10,000,000.00. For
2 purposes of this subdivision, the purchase or lease of one or more articles of
3 diagnostic or therapeutic equipment that are necessarily interdependent in the
4 performance of their ordinary functions or that would constitute any health
5 care facility included under subdivision 9432(8)(B) of this title, as determined
6 by the Board, shall be considered together in calculating the amount of an
7 expenditure. The Board’s determination of functional interdependence of
8 items of equipment under this subdivision shall have the effect of a final

10 (3) The offering of a health care service or technology having an annual
11 operating expense that exceeds $1,000,000.00 $10,000,000.00 for either of the

13 employed, either on a fixed or a mobile basis, by the hospital within the
14 previous three fiscal years.
15 (4) A change from one licensing period to the next in the number of
16 licensed beds of a health care facility through addition or conversion, or
17 through relocation from one physical facility or site to another.
18 (5) The offering of any home health service.
19 (c) In the case of a project that requires a certificate of need under this
20 section, expenditures for which are anticipated to be in excess of
21 $30,000,000.00 $50,000,000.00, the applicant first shall secure a conceptual
BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.96
2025 Page 5 of 12
1 development phase certificate of need, in accordance with the standards and
2 procedures established in this subchapter, that permits the applicant to make
3 expenditures for architectural services, engineering design services, or any
4 other planning services, as defined by the Board, needed in connection with
5 the project. Upon completion of the conceptual development phase of the
6 project, and before offering or further developing the project, the applicant
7 shall secure a final certificate of need in accordance with the standards and
8 procedures established in this subchapter. Applicants shall not be subject to
9 sanctions for failure to comply with the provisions of this subsection if such
10 failure is solely the result of good faith reliance on verified project cost
11 estimates issued by qualified persons, which cost estimates would have led a
12 reasonable person to conclude the project was not anticipated to be in excess of
13 $30,000,000.00 $50,000,000.00 and therefore not subject to this subsection.
14 The provisions of this subsection notwithstanding, expenditures may be made

16 need, which expenditures shall not exceed $1,500,000.00 for non-hospitals or
17 $3,000,000.00 for hospitals $10,000,000.00.

21 person shall be required to submit an application for a certificate of need for
BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.96
2025 Page 6 of 12
1 the entire project, and the Board may proceed under section 9445 of this title.
2 The Board’s determination under this subsection shall have the effect of a final
3 decision and is subject to appeal under section 9381 of this title.
4 (e) The Board may periodically adjust the monetary jurisdictional
5 thresholds contained in this section. In doing so, the Board shall reflect the
6 same categories of health care facilities, services, and programs recognized in
7 this section. Any adjustment by the Board shall not exceed an amount
8 calculated using the cumulative Consumer Price Indexrate of inflation.

5 (5) The offering of a health care service or technology having an annual
6 operating expense that exceeds $500,000.00 $10,000,000.00 for either of the
7 next two budgeted fiscal years, if the service or technology was not offered or
8 employed, either on a fixed or a mobile basis, by the health care facility within
9 the previous three fiscal years.
10 (6) The construction, development, purchase, lease, or other
11 establishment or expansion of an ambulatory surgical center for which the cost
12 exceeds $10,000,000.00.
13 (b) A hospital shall not develop or have developed on its behalf a new
14 health care project without issuance of a certificate of need by the Board. For
15 purposes of this subsection, a “new health care project” includes the following:
16 (1) The construction, development, purchase, renovation, or other
17 establishment of a health care facility, or any capital expenditure by or on
18 behalf of a hospital, for which the capital cost exceeds $3,000,000.00

1 of a donation the value, is in excess of $1,500,000.00 $10,000,000.00. For
2 purposes of this subdivision, the purchase or lease of one or more articles of
3 diagnostic or therapeutic equipment that are necessarily interdependent in the
4 performance of their ordinary functions or that would constitute any health
5 care facility included under subdivision 9432(8)(B) of this title, as determined
6 by the Board, shall be considered together in calculating the amount of an
7 expenditure. The Board’s determination of functional interdependence of
8 items of equipment under this subdivision shall have the effect of a final
9 decision and is subject to appeal under section 9381 of this title.
10 (3) The offering of a health care service or technology having an annual
11 operating expense that exceeds $1,000,000.00 $10,000,000.00 for either of the
12 next two budgeted fiscal years, if the service or technology was not offered or
13 employed, either on a fixed or a mobile basis, by the hospital within the
14 previous three fiscal years.
15 (4) A change from one licensing period to the next in the number of
16 licensed beds of a health care facility through addition or conversion, or
17 through relocation from one physical facility or site to another.

19 (c) In the case of a project that requires a certificate of need under this
20 section, expenditures for which are anticipated to be in excess of
21 $30,000,000.00 $50,000,000.00, the applicant first shall secure a conceptual

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.96
2025 Page 5 of 12
1 development phase certificate of need, in accordance with the standards and
2 procedures established in this subchapter, that permits the applicant to make
3 expenditures for architectural services, engineering design services, or any
4 other planning services, as defined by the Board, needed in connection with
5 the project. Upon completion of the conceptual development phase of the
6 project, and before offering or further developing the project, the applicant
7 shall secure a final certificate of need in accordance with the standards and
8 procedures established in this subchapter. Applicants shall not be subject to
9 sanctions for failure to comply with the provisions of this subsection if such
10 failure is solely the result of good faith reliance on verified project cost
11 estimates issued by qualified persons, which cost estimates would have led a
12 reasonable person to conclude the project was not anticipated to be in excess of
13 $30,000,000.00 $50,000,000.00 and therefore not subject to this subsection.
14 The provisions of this subsection notwithstanding, expenditures may be made
15 in preparation for obtaining a conceptual development phase certificate of
16 need, which expenditures shall not exceed $1,500,000.00 for non-hospitals or
17 $3,000,000.00 for hospitals $10,000,000.00.
18 (d) If the Board determines that a person required to obtain a certificate of
19 need under this subchapter has separated a single project into components in
20 order to avoid cost thresholds or other requirements under this subchapter, the
21 person shall be required to submit an application for a certificate of need for

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.96

1 the entire project, and the Board may proceed under section 9445 of this title.
2 The Board’s determination under this subsection shall have the effect of a final
3 decision and is subject to appeal under section 9381 of this title.
4 (e) The Board may periodically adjust the monetary jurisdictional
5 thresholds contained in this section. In doing so, the Board shall reflect the
6 same categories of health care facilities, services, and programs recognized in
7 this section. Any adjustment by the Board shall not exceed an amount
8 calculated using the cumulative Consumer Price Indexrate of inflation.
