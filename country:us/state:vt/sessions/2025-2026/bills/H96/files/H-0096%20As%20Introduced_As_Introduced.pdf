2 procedures established in this subchapter, that permits the applicant to make

6 and before offering or further developing the project, the applicant shall secure
7 a final certificate of need in accordance with the standards and procedures
8 established in this subchapter. Applicants shall not be subject to sanctions for
9 failure to comply with the provisions of this subsection if such failure is solely
10 the result of good faith reliance on verified project cost estimates issued by
