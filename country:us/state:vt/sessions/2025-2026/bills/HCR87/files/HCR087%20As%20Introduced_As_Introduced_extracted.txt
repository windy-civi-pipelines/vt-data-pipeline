program on winning a fifth consecutive Division II championship
Whereas, during the 2024–2025 regular season, the first-seeded Solons and the third-seeded Harwood

was not insurmountable, and

drive, outscoring Harwood 19–10, ensuring a final 68–57 victory, and achieving a consecutive-year
boys’ basketball championship record not seen in Vermont high school competition in over three
decades, and
