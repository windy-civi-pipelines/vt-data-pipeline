Whereas, during the 2024–2025 regular season, the first-seeded Solons and the third-
seeded Harwood Highlanders had two encounters in which Montpelier strongly outscored
Harwood, and the highly experienced Solons team was determined to repeat those earlier
on-court performances at the Division II championship contest played at the Barre
Auditorium, and
Whereas, the game proved to be a spirited hoop encounter, as at halftime the 40–30
Montpelier lead was not insurmountable, and
Whereas, recognizing the Highlanders’ perseverance, the Solons accelerated their
fourth-quarter drive, outscoring Harwood 19–10, ensuring a final 68–57 victory, and
achieving a consecutive-year boys’ basketball championship record not seen in Vermont
high school competition in over three decades, and
Whereas, the victorious Solons were Kayden Anderson-Hall, Kleo Bridge, Carter
Bruzzese, Carson Cody, Clayton Foster, Cayden Haley, Winter Holloway, Weston Jones,
Atif Milak, Orion Nuss, Joseph Nyiringabo, Stone Poor, Colby Sterling-Proulx, Eliades
Toman-Greenberg, and Alex Weinstein, and
Whereas, Head Coach Nick Foster and assistant coaches Bill Bruzzese, Ryan Booth,
and Anthony Roberts inspired the team throughout the 2024–2025 basketball season, now
therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the Montpelier High School Solons boys’
basketball program on winning a fifth consecutive Division II championship, and be it
further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
