2 Sec. 1. LEGISLATIVE INTENT
3 It is the intent of the General Assembly that:
4 (1) by increasing from four to six the number of psychiatric residential
5 beds that the Department of Mental Health oversees or contracts for statewide,
6 in addition to those currently available in northern and central Vermont, a
7 greater number of individuals in crisis will be successfully diverted from
8 inpatient psychiatric settings;
9 (2) by providing adequate residential alternatives to hospitalization for
10 individuals in mental health crisis, Vermonters will have greater access to
11 residential support and various therapeutic options during mental health crisis;
12 (3) by expanding peer-supported programming, individuals in mental
13 health crisis seeking an alternative to hospitalization receive effective,
14 compassionate, and affordable care;
15 (4) the State and those individuals seeking support during a mental
16 health crisis may avoid incurring expensive hospitalization costs; and
17 (5) by providing more residential beds for short- to medium-term stays,
18 individuals in mental health crisis will have fewer long-term stays in Vermont
19 hospital emergency departments.
