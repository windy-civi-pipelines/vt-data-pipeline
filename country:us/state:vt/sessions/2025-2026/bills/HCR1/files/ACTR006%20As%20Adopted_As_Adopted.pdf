Whereas, Richford Junior-Senior High School had not won a boys’ track and field
divisional title since 2015, and the 2024 team coalesced around the goal of winning the
Division IV crown in honor of its former assistant coach, Andre LaBier, who in 2024
retired as the school’s resource officer, and
Whereas, at the championship meet, held at Thompson Park in Manchester, the
Falcons secured first place in the 200m and 400m, the 4x100 relay, and the triple jump,
and the team’s consistently solid performances resulted in its outscoring second-place
Green Mountain Union High School (137–112) for a great victory, and
Whereas, the Falcons, who received a rousing fire department welcome on their
triumphant return home, were Carson Steinhour, Carter Blaney, Daniel Blazevic, Davian
Coy, David Scott, Eli Martin, Silas Martin, Jerrick Jacobs, Lars Riesterer, Lucas Kalo,
Matthew Stryker, Oliver Pike, Tristan Whitestone, and Wyatt Chagnon, and
Whereas, the innovative leadership of Head Coach Richard Flint and Assistant Coach
Kaydeen Juaire inspired the team, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2024 Richford Junior-Senior High
School Falcons Division IV championship boys’ track and field team, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Richford Junior-Senior High School.
