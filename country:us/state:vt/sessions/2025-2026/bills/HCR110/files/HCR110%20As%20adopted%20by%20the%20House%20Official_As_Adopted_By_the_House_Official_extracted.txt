House concurrent resolution designating April 2025 as Black Maternal Care Awareness Month in Vermont
Whereas, according to a Commonwealth Fund study released in June 2024, the United States has the highest
maternal death rate among the world’s high-income nations, and the maternal death rate for Black women in
this country is significantly higher than for other racial groups, and
Whereas, provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that, in
September 2024, the maternal death rate for non-Hispanic White women was 14.9 per 100,000 live births, an
admittedly high rate, but the comparable rate for non-Hispanic Black women was far higher, at 50.5 per
100,000 live births, and
Whereas, the most recently published CDC infant mortality data by race and Hispanic origin from 2023
reported 4.48 infant deaths per 1,000 live births for non-Hispanic White women, while the non-Hispanic Black
infant mortality rate was 10.93 per 1,000 live births, and
Whereas, research reported in The American Journal of Maternal/Child Nursing documented that rates of
depression and anxiety during pregnancy overall in the United States ranged from 14–16 percent, but were a
considerably higher maximum of 28 percent for Black women, and
Whereas, the higher prevalence of Black women lacking access to comprehensive prenatal care or health
insurance coverage contributes to these statistics, and
Whereas, to bring attention to this situation, the Black Mamas Matter Alliance annually observes the Week
of April 11–17 as Black Maternal Health Week to “raise awareness around racial inequities in maternal health
outcomes in the United States” and to celebrate those individuals working to address these disparities, now
therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly designates April 2025 as Black Maternal Care Awareness Month in Vermont,
and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the Black Mamas
Matter Alliance.
