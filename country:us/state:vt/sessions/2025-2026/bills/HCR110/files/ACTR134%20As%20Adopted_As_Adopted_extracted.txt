Whereas, according to a Commonwealth Fund study released in June 2024, the United
States has the highest maternal death rate among the world’s high-income nations, and
the maternal death rate for Black women in this country is significantly higher than for
other racial groups, and
Whereas, provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
show that, in September 2024, the maternal death rate for non-Hispanic White women
was 14.9 per 100,000 live births, an admittedly high rate, but the comparable rate for
non-Hispanic Black women was far higher, at 50.5 per 100,000 live births, and
Whereas, the most recently published CDC infant mortality data by race and Hispanic
origin from 2023 reported 4.48 infant deaths per 1,000 live births for non-Hispanic White
women, while the non-Hispanic Black infant mortality rate was 10.93 per 1,000 live
births, and
Whereas, research reported in The American Journal of Maternal/Child Nursing
documented that rates of depression and anxiety during pregnancy overall in the United
States ranged from 14–16 percent, but were a considerably higher maximum of 28
percent for Black women, and
Whereas, the higher prevalence of Black women lacking access to comprehensive
prenatal care or health insurance coverage contributes to these statistics, and
Whereas, to bring attention to this situation, the Black Mamas Matter Alliance
annually observes the Week of April 11–17 as Black Maternal Health Week to “raise
awareness around racial inequities in maternal health outcomes in the United States” and
to celebrate those individuals working to address these disparities, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly designates April 2025 as Black Maternal Care Awareness
Month in Vermont, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the Black Mamas Matter Alliance.
