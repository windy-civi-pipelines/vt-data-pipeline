9 Program. It would expand the eligibility criteria to apply for Home
10 Weatherization Assistance Program grants. It also proposes to accelerate and
11 increase administrative and financial support of weatherization trade workforce

1 benefit the health of Vermont citizens, the environment, and the economy.

4 Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and the Home Heating Fuel Assistance
5 Program.
6 (2) Increase job opportunities in the field of weatherization and
7 alternative heating systems by recruiting and training new applicants to the
8 industry.
9 (3) Weatherization is a means for homeowners to protect the
10 environment and diminish the outflow of the money to the fossil fuel industry.
11 (4) Workforce availability remains a limiting factor in Vermont’s effort
12 to comply with required greenhouse gas emissions reductions from the
13 building sector. Increasing the wage level while aggressively recruiting and
14 training new applicants can eventually overcome the workforce shortage.
