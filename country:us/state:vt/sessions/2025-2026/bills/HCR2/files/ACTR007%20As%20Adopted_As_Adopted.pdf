No. R-7. House concurrent resolution congratulating the 2024 Missisquoi Valley
Union High School Thunderbirds Division I championship softball team
(H.R.C.2)
Offered by Representatives Hango of Berkshire, Laroche of Franklin, Oliver of
Sheldon, Walker of Swanton, and Gregoire of Fairfield
Offered by Senators Brock and Norris
Whereas, at 2024 Division I softball’s decisive contest, played at Castleton, the fifth-
seeded Thunderbirds challenged the second-seeded Mt. Anthony Patriots for the sport’s
top honor, and the game proved an exciting day on the diamond, and
Whereas, although the Patriots were the first on the scoreboard, these opening runs
signaled the start of a seesaw battle during which each team enjoyed a lead, but at the end
of the seven standard innings, the teams were tied at seven-all, necessitating extra innings
to determine the game’s outcome, and
Whereas, in the eighth inning, sensing the suspense should be ended quickly, a
Thunderbird stole both second and third base, accelerating her scoring of the final run,
and securing an 8–7 Missisquoi victory, and
Whereas, the thrilled Thunderbirds, who played with skill and enthusiasm, were Kerri
Campbell, Molly Gagne, Molly Medor, Brooke Rainville, Sierra Reynolds, Lizi
Bourdeau, Kirby King, Josie Maguire, Cayley Renaudette, Abigail Wilcox, Lillianna
Fournier, Addison Gates, Avery Guyette, Addy Longway, Brooke Pilbin, Jadyn Lapan,
and Ava Howe, and
Whereas, Head Coach Bill Sheets; assistant coaches Megan Rowell, Connie Sheets,
and Emily Bourdeau; and team managers Alexis Beyor and Kyle Perkins were all critical
to the Thunderbirds’ success, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2024 Missisquoi Valley Union High
School Thunderbirds Division I championship softball team, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Missisquoi Valley Union High School.
