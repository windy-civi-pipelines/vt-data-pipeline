Act No. 22 (S.36). An act relating to the delivery and payment of certain services provided
through the Agency of Human Services, services for persons who are incapacitated,
and Human Services Board proceedings
Subjects: Medicaid; human services; mental health; substance use disorder; long-
term residential treatment
This act requires the Agency of Human Services (AHS) to provide coverage for
medically necessary high-intensity, medically monitored residential treatment episodes
and medically necessary low-intensity, clinically managed residential treatment episodes
when prescribed by a health care professional employed by a residential program who is
practicing within the scope of the health care professional’s license and the residential
treatment program is participating in Vermont’s Medicaid program. It further requires
that coverage of these residential treatment episodes be for the entire length of stay
prescribed by the health care professional.
This act requires AHS to conduct a review of the Medicaid payment model for
residential substance use disorder treatment services and submit the results of the review
to the General Assembly on or before December 1, 2025.
This act eliminates a repeal that would have prohibited individuals who are
incapacitated due to use of alcohol or other drugs from being held at a Department of
Corrections’ facility. It requires the Departments of Health and of Mental Health’s
existing plan to expand services and programming for individuals incapacitated due to
use of alcohol or other drugs to prioritize Chittenden County. It also requires the
submission of two presentations to the General Assembly on or before February 15,
2026. The first is a joint presentation from the Departments of Health and of Mental
Health on efforts to expand services and programming for individuals who are
incapacitated due to use of alcohol or other drugs. The second is a presentation from the
Department of Corrections on efforts to reinstate the practice of connecting individuals
who are in a correctional facility due to incapacitation from alcohol or other drug use
with appropriate community-based substance use recovery providers.
This act requires AHS, in consultation with the Human Services Board, the Office of
the Attorney General, each of the Agency’s departments with cases before the Human
Services Board, community partners, and individuals with lived experience as appellants
before the Board, to submit a report by December 15, 2025, with various
recommendations on Board proceedings. Some of the reporting requirements include a
proposal for attorney training and a proposal on resolving potential appeals prior to
reaching the Board. It also requires the Board, in consultation with AHS, each of the
Agency’s departments with cases before the Human Services Board, the Office of
Attorney General, community partners, and individuals with lived experience as
appellants before the Board, to submit a report by December 15, 2025, with various
recommendations on Board proceedings. Some of the reporting requirements include a
