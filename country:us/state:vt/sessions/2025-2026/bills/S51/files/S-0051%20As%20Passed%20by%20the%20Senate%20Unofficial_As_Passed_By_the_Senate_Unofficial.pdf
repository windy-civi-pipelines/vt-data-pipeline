2 An act relating to the Vermont unpaid caregiver tax credit
3 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
4 Sec. 1. FINDINGS
5 The General Assembly finds:
6 (1) According to the U.S. Department of Labor, women in the United
7 States 55 years of age and older provide 26.6 million hours of unpaid care to
8 family and friends daily.
9 (2) According to the AARP:
10 (A) More than 75 percent of family caregivers 50 years of age and
11 older who retired early because of family caregiving responsibilities would
12 have remained in the workforce longer if they had access to financial or
13 nonfinancial supports.
14 (B) If family caregivers aged 50 years of age and older have access to
15 support in the workplace, U.S. Gross Domestic Product could grow by an
16 additional $1.7 trillion (5.5 percent) in 2030.
17 (3) According to a 2023 report by the Urban Institute, entitled “Lifetime
18 Employment-Related Costs to Women of Providing Family Care,” the
19 employment-related costs for mothers of providing unpaid care to minor
20 children and parents, parents-in-law, and spouses (including unmarried
21 partners) with care needs average $295,000.00 over a lifetime.
