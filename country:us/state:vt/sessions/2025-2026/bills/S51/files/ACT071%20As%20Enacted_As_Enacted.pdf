child tax credit under the laws of the United States or who would have been
entitled to a child tax credit under the laws of the United States but for the fact
that the individual or the individual’s spouse does not have a taxpayer

taxable year shall be in the amount of $1,000.00 per qualifying child, as
defined under 26 U.S.C. § 152(c) but notwithstanding the taxpayer
identification number requirements under 26 U.S.C. § 24(e) and (h)(7), who is
five six years of age or younger as of the close of the calendar year in which
the taxable year of the taxpayer begins. For a part-year resident individual, the
amount of the credit shall be multiplied by the percentage that the individual’s
income that is earned or received during the period of the individual’s
residency in this State bears to the individual’s total income. An otherwise
eligible individual shall be entitled to the credit under this section without
regard for the laws of the United States pertaining to the amount of federal
child tax credit that may be refunded.
