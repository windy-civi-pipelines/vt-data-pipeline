Act No. 71 (S.51). An act relating to Vermont income tax exclusions and tax credits
Subjects: Income tax; taxation; tax credit
This act makes several changes to Vermont income tax credits and income tax
exclusions. For the Vermont child tax credit, it increases the maximum age for a child to
count as a qualifying child from age five to age six. For the Vermont earned income tax
credit, it increases the amount provided to an individual who does not claim any
qualifying children from 38 percent of the federal credit to 100 percent of the federal
credit. For the exclusion of retirement income, the act increases the income thresholds
used to determine eligibility by $5,000.00 of adjusted gross income. The act further
expands the exclusion of U.S. military retirement income by allowing an exclusion for
survivor benefits and significantly increasing the income thresholds for eligibility and the
amount that can be excluded from income taxation. The act also creates a Vermont
veteran tax credit for residents with low income who have a discharge record from the
uniformed services.
