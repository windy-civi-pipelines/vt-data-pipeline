6 Referred to Committee on
7 Date:
8 Subject: Court procedure; pleadings generally; strategic lawsuits against public
9 participation
10 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to include good
11 faith reports or complaints involving sex offenses or sexual harassment within
12 the protections of the anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuits against public
13 participation) statute. The SLAPP statute is intended to address lawsuits that
14 are brought for the purpose of chilling the valid exercise of the constitutional
15 right to freedom of speech and freedom to petition the government by striking
16 the action if it is devoid of any reasonable factual support and any arguable
17 basis in law and has not caused actual harm. This act extends those protections
18 to cases in which a person has filed a report regarding a sex offense or sexual
19 harassment.
