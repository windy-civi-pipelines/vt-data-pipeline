Whereas, on March 18, 1850, the Bennington village trustees passed an ordinance
establishing the Bennington Fire Department “to consist of such persons and officers, and
such number of engine companies and hook and ladder companies as shall from time to
time be ordered and directed by said village,” and
Whereas, land was acquired and the funding secured for the construction of two
firehouses, which became the headquarters for Spartan Engine Company #1 on Pleasant
Street near North Street and Protection Engine Company #2 on East Main Street opposite
Morgan Street, and
Whereas, over the decades, with the upgrading and modernization of equipment and
departmental expansion in a growing community, the two original companies were
transformed into today’s four highly trained and prepared companies, and
Whereas, the W.H. Bradford Hook and Ladder Company #1 was established on
October 28, 1866, and
Whereas, Stark Hose Company #1 is the direct descendant of Spartan Engine
Company #1, which from 1871 until 1887 was known as the General Stark Steamer
Company, and
Whereas, the H.W. Putnam Company #3 was organized on June 20, 1887, and
Whereas, the Eagle Hose Company #4 was formed on February 12, 1894, and all four
companies are now located at the central fire station on River Street, and
Whereas, under the outstanding leadership of Chief Nathan Berres, the Bennington
Fire Department is proud of the organization’s many accomplishments as it celebrates
175 years of volunteer firefighting excellence and looks to the future, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly commemorates the 175th anniversary of the Bennington
Fire Department, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
each of the four companies of the Bennington Fire Department.
