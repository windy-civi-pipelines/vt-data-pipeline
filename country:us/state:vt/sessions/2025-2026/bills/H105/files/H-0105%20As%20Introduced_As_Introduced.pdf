1 H.105
2 Introduced by Representative Dolan of Essex Junction
3 Referred to Committee on
4 Date:
5 Subject: Youth; juveniles; alcohol possession; impaired driving; Youth
6 Substance Awareness Safety Program
7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to expand the
8 Youth Substance Awareness Safety Program (YSASP) by lowering the
9 minimum age of eligible individuals to 10 years of age and to include
10 violations for youth who engage in impaired driving with a minimum 0.02
11 blood alcohol concentration. By expanding YSASP to include impaired
12 driving, the bill proposes to incentivize accountability and treatment and
13 clarify that the person is subject to a delinquency petition if the person is
14 unsuccessful in YSASP. This bill further proposes such an incentive by rolling
15 in the relevant provisions of 23 V.S.A. § 1216 into 7 V.S.A. § 656.
