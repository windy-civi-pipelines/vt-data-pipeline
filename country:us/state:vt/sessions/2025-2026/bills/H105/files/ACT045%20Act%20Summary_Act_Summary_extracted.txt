Act No. 45 (H.105). An act relating to expanding the Youth Substance Awareness Safety
Program
Subjects: Youth; juveniles; impaired driving; alcohol possession; Youth Substance
Awareness Safety Program
This act expands the Youth Substance Awareness Safety Program (YSASP) to include
underage violations for cannabis possession and impaired driving, along with technical
statutory changes to account for these inclusions.
Specifically, the statutes governing underage cannabis possession and impaired
driving violations are repealed and the violations are no longer delinquencies adjudicated
in the Family Division of the Vermont Superior Court. Instead, these violations are
referred to YSASP for appropriate remedial programming, including automatic license
suspensions for impaired driving violations and automatic license reinstatements for
successful completion of YSASP. If the participant fails to meet certain statutory and
YSASP requirements, then the infractions are treated as civil violations to be adjudicated
by the Judicial Bureau.
The act also creates reporting requirements on various data points related to underage
impaired driving violations and suspensions, along with a Public Records Act exemption
for information disclosed during the YSASP process.
Effective Date: July 1, 2025
