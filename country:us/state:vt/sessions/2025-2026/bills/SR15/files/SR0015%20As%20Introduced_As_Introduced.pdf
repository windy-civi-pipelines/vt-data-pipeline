S.R. 15. Senate resolution relating to urging that all State agencies, departments, and offices protect the civil rights,
medical confidentiality, and all aspects of personal privacy of Vermonters who have been diagnosed with autism in light of
theSecretary of the U.S. Health and Human Services’ recently announced plans to establish an autism research database and
otherdatabasesrelatedtoautism.
Whereas, theStateofVermontis fullycommittedtoensuringtheenforcement oftherightsofindividualswith disabilities

Whereas, individuals with autism contribute their talents, perspectives, and problem-solving abilities to strengthen
Vermont’sworkforce;enrich familiesand communities;andadvance innovationin science, technology, the arts, and beyond,

attributabletoimproveddiagnosticpractices, greaterawarenessofautism, andexpandedaccesstoscreeningtools, and
Whereas, individuals with disabilities, including individuals with autism, are too often stigmatized and underestimated,

planstoestablishafederalresearchdatabaseintendedtobeusedtoinvestigatetherootcausesofautism, and

medicalrecords;andwearabledevices, suchassmartwatches, and
Whereas, although this new database is no longer characterized as an “autism registry,” as Secretary Kennedy and
National Institutes of Health Director, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, had previously announced, and despite public promises of
personal and medical privacy, significant concerns remain regarding the potential use of Vermonters’ sensitive, personally
identifiablehealthcareinformationwithouttheirspecificandinformedconsent, and
