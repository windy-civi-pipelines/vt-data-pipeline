Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 131
Offered by Senators Harrison and Hashim
House concurrent resolution congratulating Westgate Housing Inc. of Brattleboro on the nonprofit
corporation’s 25th anniversary
Whereas, the story of Westgate Housing Inc. is the saga of residents determined to continue residing in their
affordable rental housing units and becoming actively involved in their community’s management, and
Whereas, Westgate was privately constructed in 1971 as a 98-unit rental housing complexpursuant to a
contract with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that guaranteed the units would remain
affordable for 20–40 years, and
Whereas, after the initial 20-year contractual period expired, it was apparent that significant rent increases
were looming that would force most residents to find alternative housing, and
Whereas, during the 1990s, the Westgate Tenants Association began organizing with the goal of avoiding
Westgate’s gentrification and the resulting involuntary departures from their community, and
Whereas, in 2000, following considerable effort, a coalition of nonprofit organizations under the combined
leadership of Housing Vermont and Westgate residents purchased the property, and the groups formed the new
nonprofit Westgate Housing Inc. (WHI) to own and manage the property, and
Whereas, since December 2000, Housing Vermont and WHI have acted as partners in Westgate’s ownership,
retaining rents considerably below market rates and providing the residents with input in the community’s
management, and
Whereas, the percentage of the WHI Board’s resident membership continued to increase, reaching 100
percent in 2009, the intended permanent organizational structure, and
Whereas, consequently, Westgate is one of the few resident-controlled rental housing developments in the
United States, and
Whereas, the resulting residential pride has led to a vibrant community that takes responsibility for its
operation and maintains a high level of neighborhood quality and civic engagement, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates Westgate Housing Inc. of Brattleboro on the nonprofit
corporation’s 25th anniversary, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to WHI.
