3 Referred to Committee on
4 Date:
5 Subject: Conservation and development; State land; wildlands
6 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to designate
7 certain lands as State wildlands and create a process for the designation of
8 State wildlands in the future.
9 An act relating to the designation of State wildlands
10 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
11 Sec. 1. SHORT TITLE
12 This act may be cited as the “Vermont Climate Resilience and State
13 Wildlands Act.”
14 Sec. 2. FINDINGS
15 The General Assembly finds:
16 (1) The planet is facing the consequences of climate change and the
17 catastrophic loss of biodiversity, both globally and locally.
18 (2) Intact and connected ecosystems reduce flood risks, mitigate
19 drought, sequester and store carbon, and support Vermont’s biodiversity and
20 clean water.
VT LEG #379419 v.2

1 (3) Vermont’s most effective and efficient contribution to conserving
2 biological diversity and maintaining a landscape resilient to climate change is
3 to conserve an intact and connected landscape.
4 (4) The Department of Fish and Wildlife, working within the Agency of
5 Natural Resources and with Vermont conservation organizations, has
6 developed Vermont Conservation Design, a framework to sustain the State’s
7 ecologically functional landscape into the future.
8 (5) Vermont Conservation Design finds that:
9 (A) historically, the vast majority of Vermont’s landscape was old
10 forest, and it is the original habitat condition for many species;
11 (B) the State’s native flora and fauna that have been here prior to
12 European settlement are adapted to this landscape of old, structurally complex
13 forest punctuated by natural disturbance gaps and occasional natural openings
14 such as wetlands or rock outcrops;
15 (C) the complex physical structure of old forests creates diverse
16 habitats, many of which are absent or much less abundant in younger forests;
17 (D) as a result of the persistent structural and vegetative complexity
18 above ground and the diverse biome belowground and associated complex
19 biotic and abiotic relationships that develop over time, old forests also protect
20 water quality, sequester and store carbon, provide opportunities for adaptation
21 of species and community relationships to climate and other environmental

1 changes, and set an ecological benchmark against which to measure active
2 management of Vermont’s forests;
3 (E) although there are small patches of old forest scattered around the
4 state, old forest is absent in Vermont as a functional component of the
5 landscape;
6 (F) allowing about nine percent of Vermont’s forest to become old
7 forest will bring this missing component back to Vermont’s landscape and
8 offer confidence that species that benefit from or depend on this condition can
9 persist; and
10 (G) in most forests, passive restoration will result in old forest
11 conditions.
12 (6) Only approximately four percent of Vermont and three percent of
13 New England are managed as ecological reserves as defined in 10 V.S.A.
14 chapter 89, to assist with restoration of old forests.
15 (7) State lands provide only two percent of Vermont’s average annual
16 timber harvest volume.
17 (8) Ninety percent of State lands are located in forested headwater
18 settings, which are particularly susceptible to generating runoff during storm
19 events, given their topography and geologic setting.

1 (9) 2023 Acts and Resolves No. 59 called for prioritizing ecological
2 reserve areas to protect highest priority natural communities and maintain or
3 restore old forests.
4 (10) To meet the goals of 2023 Acts and Resolves No. 59, the State of
5 Vermont requires a statutory landscape designation to facilitate the
6 establishment of ecological reserves on State lands.
7 Sec. 3. 10 V.S.A. chapter 90 is created:
8 CHAPTER 90. STATE WILDLANDS
