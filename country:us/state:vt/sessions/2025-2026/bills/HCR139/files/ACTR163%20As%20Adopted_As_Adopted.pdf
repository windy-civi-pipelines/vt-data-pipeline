Whereas, farmers markets are a special venue for local agricultural and culinary
producers to market their edible products and for artisans to display and sell their
creations, and
Whereas, they serve as the ideal setting to act on the slogan “buy local” and to
participate in an event that exudes community spirit and often features the
accompaniment of vocalists and instrumentalists presenting the best of local musical
talent, and
Whereas, one of Vermont’s premier and oldest farmers' markets is the vendor-owned
Brattleboro Area Farmers’ Market (originally the Brattleboro Farmers’ Market), which
was established on a small scale in 1975, and
Whereas, the Brattleboro Area Farmers’ Market’s continued growth has included an
expansion in the number of vendors and activities and has prompted several relocations
to accommodate its popularity, and
Whereas, every Saturday from 9:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m. starting in May and
continuing through October at 570 Western Avenue (Route 9), the Brattleboro Area
Farmers’ Market convenes for five hours of commerce, enjoyment, and good cheer, and
Whereas, in 2006, the success of this three-season event sparked the creation of a
separate winter companion, and
Whereas, on Saturday, May 17, 2025, the Brattleboro Area Farmers’ Market will
conduct a commemorative ceremony to mark its half-century milestone of serving the
community as a place to purchase locally produced foods and crafts, enjoy great music,
and meet neighbors old and new, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the Brattleboro Area Farmers’ Market on its
50th anniversary, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the Brattleboro Area Farmers’ Market.
