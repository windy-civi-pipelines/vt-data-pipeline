Whereas, starting in 2024, the Green Mountain Hometown Heroes Corporation, in
collaboration with Bennington American Legion Post 13 Riders and the Bennington
VFW Post 1332 Riders, organized a commemorative display of customized banners
along Route 7, extending from Four Corners in downtown Bennington to the Vermont
Veterans’ Home, honoring past and present Bennington-associated members of our
nation’s armed forces who served in the U.S. Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marine
Corps, Merchant Marines, Navy, Space Force, and the Vermont National Guard, and
Whereas, the individuals who were recognized served in military conflicts as long ago
as the Civil War and in the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, the
Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, and the Global War on Terror, and
Whereas, this special celebration enabled family members or descendants to
commemorate their loved ones who are on active duty, who were honorably discharged,
or who were killed while serving our country, and
Whereas, this patriotic tribute to Bennington’s military veterans became a reality due
to successful partnerships with the Bennington Select Board and Town Manager, who
granted official approval for this innovative endeavor; Bennington’s public works crew,
which installed the banners; and Green Mountain Power, which gave permission for the
banners to be displayed on its utility poles, and
Whereas, on November 11, 2024, Veterans Day, the Green Mountain Hometown
Heroes Banner Program was formally dedicated in a solemnly reflective ceremony
occurring in Bennington, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly honors the Green Mountain Hometown Heroes Banner
Program and its recognized members of the U.S. Armed Forces, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the Green Mountain Hometown Heroes Corporation, Bennington American Legion Post
13 Riders, Bennington VFW Post 1332 Riders, the Bennington Town Manager, and
Green Mountain Power.
