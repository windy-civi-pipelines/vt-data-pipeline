House concurrent resolution honoring the Green Mountain Hometown Heroes Banner Program and its
recognized members of the U.S. Armed Forces
Whereas, starting in 2024, the Green Mountain Hometown Heroes Corporation, in collaboration with
Bennington American Legion Post 13 Riders and the Bennington VFW Post 1332 Riders, organized a
commemorative display of customized banners along Route 7, extending from Four Corners in downtown
Bennington to the Vermont Veterans’ Home, honoring past and present Bennington-associated members of our
nation’s armed forces who served in the U.S. Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Merchant Marines,
Navy, Space Force, and the Vermont National Guard, and
Whereas, the individuals who were recognized served in military conflicts as long ago as the Civil War and
in the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, and
the Global War on Terror, and
Whereas, this special celebration enabled family members or descendants to commemorate their loved ones
who are on active duty, who were honorably discharged, or who were killed while serving our country, and
Whereas, this patriotic tribute to Bennington’s military veterans became a reality due to successful
partnerships with the Bennington Select Board and Town Manager, who granted official approval for this
innovative endeavor; Bennington’s public works crew, which installed the banners; and Green Mountain Power,
which gave permission for the banners to be displayed on its utility poles, and
Whereas, on November 11, 2024, Veterans Day, the Green Mountain Hometown Heroes Banner Program
was formally dedicated in a solemnly reflective ceremony occurring in Bennington, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly honors the Green Mountain Hometown Heroes Banner Program and its
recognized members of the U.S. Armed Forces, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the Green Mountain
Hometown Heroes Corporation, Bennington American Legion Post 13 Riders, Bennington VFW Post 1332
Riders, the Bennington Town Manager, and Green Mountain Power.
