2 Sec. 1. 16 V.S.A. § 822b is added to read:
3 § 822b. SCHOOL CHOICE
4 (a) Policy. It shall be the policy of the State of Vermont to allow a parent
5 and the parent’s child in grades prekindergarten through 12 to choose which
6 public or independent school the child shall attend, regardless of the child’s
7 district of residence.
8 (b) Parental choice of school. On or before a date set by the Secretary of
9 Education in the second semester of a school year, the parent or guardian of a
10 student may select from a list of public and approved independent schools
11 maintained by the Agency of Education the school to which the parent or
12 guardian wishes to have the parent or guardian’s child attend for the coming
13 school year, and shall notify the Agency of that choice. Failure to notify the
14 Agency in a timely manner shall be deemed to indicate that the parent or
15 guardian wishes the child to remain in the school in which the student currently
16 attends. The State Board of Education shall by rule provide for midyear
17 transfers and adjustments in extraordinary cases.
18 (c) Acceptance of choice of school. A Vermont public school shall accept
19 all students whose parent or guardian has selected that school unless the school
20 has insufficient capacity or resources. In that case, the school shall accept

5 student’s acceptance by the receiving school, the Agency of Education shall
6 issue a School Choice Grant to the receiving district or approved independent
7 school selected, which shall be paid from the Education Fund payment
8 otherwise due the student’s school district of residence.
9 (e) Nonoperating districts. If a district does not maintain a school for the
10 grades it is organized to provide education for its resident students, at and after
11 the inception of the program described in this section, the district shall
12 continue to pay tuition for each of its resident students according to sections
13 821 and 822 of this title until a student continuing to reside in the district
14 completes the student’s secondary education.
15 (f) Acceptance of School Choice Grants. A Vermont public school shall
16 accept the tuition paid under the School Choice Grant established in
17 subsection (d) of this section as full payment for tuition but may assess fees
18 and other charges related to the cost of providing its customary education
19 program for all of its students. An approved independent school or an out-of-
20 state public school may charge tuition in excess of the tuition amount paid
21 under the School Choice Grant under subsection (e) of this section, but
