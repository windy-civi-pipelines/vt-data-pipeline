fiber-optic service to rural communities.
(H.C.R.18)

Bennington
Whereas, reliable broadband is a critical utility that enhances economic development,
supports educational opportunities, facilitates telehealth services, enables remote work,
and strengthens communities, and
Whereas, in order to solve the rural broadband crisis in Vermont, in 2015 Acts and
Resolves No. 41, codified as 30 V.S.A. chapter 82, the General Assembly established the
process for the formation and operation of a communications union district (CUD), and
Whereas, the CUD structure places long-term control of fiber-broadband assets in the
hands of Vermonters through a governing board consisting of one representative from
each town in the CUD, and
Whereas, these unique municipal subdivisions, currently nine in number, serve a
pivotal role in addressing Vermont’s digital divide, and their financing is acquired
through the leveraging of municipal revenue bonds, securing grants from the Vermont
Community Broadband Fund, entering into public-private partnerships, and using other
financial resources, all without triggering financial liability for CUD member
communities or individuals, and
Whereas, the leadership, staff, and volunteers of the CUDs have demonstrated
extraordinary dedication and collaboration in their establishment of fiber-optic
infrastructure in rural and remote areas of Vermont, resulting in a reduction from 100,000
to 20,000 of internet addresses with no or subpar broadband service, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly honors Vermont’s communications union districts for their
visionary leadership and effective efforts in bringing world-class fiber-optic service to
rural communities, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
each CUD, the Vermont Community Development Board, and Governor Philip B. Scott.
