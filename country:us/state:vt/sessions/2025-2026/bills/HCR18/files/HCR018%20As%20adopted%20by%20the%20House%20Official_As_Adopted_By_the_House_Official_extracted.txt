Section 1:
State of Vermont
House of Representatives
Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 18
House concurrent resolution honoring Vermont’s communications union districts for their
visionary leadership and effective efforts in bringing world-class fiber-optic service to rural
communities
Whereas, reliable broadband is a critical utility that enhances economic development,
supports educational opportunities, facilitates telehealth services, enables remote work, and
strengthens communities, and
Whereas, in order to solve the rural broadband crisis in Vermont, in 2015 Acts and Resolves
No. 41, codified as 30 V.S.A. chapter 82, the General Assembly established the process for the
formation and operation of a communications union district (CUD), and
Whereas, the CUD structure places long-term control of fiber-broadband assets in the hands
of Vermonters through a governing board consisting of one representative from each town in the
CUD, and
Whereas, these unique municipal subdivisions, currently nine in number, serve a pivotal role
in addressing Vermont’s digital divide, and their financing is acquired through the leveraging of
municipal revenue bonds, securing grants from the Vermont Community Broadband Fund,
entering into public-private partnerships, and using other financial resources, all without
triggering financial liability for CUD member communities or individuals, and
Whereas, the leadership, staff, and volunteers of the CUDs have demonstrated extraordinary
dedication and collaboration in their establishment of fiber-optic infrastructure in rural and
remote areas of Vermont, resulting in a reduction from 100,000 to 20,000 of internet addresses
with no or subpar broadband service, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly honors Vermont’s communications union districts for their
visionary leadership and effective efforts in bringing world-class fiber-optic service to rural
communities, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to each
CUD, the Vermont Community Development Board, and Governor Philip B. Scott.
