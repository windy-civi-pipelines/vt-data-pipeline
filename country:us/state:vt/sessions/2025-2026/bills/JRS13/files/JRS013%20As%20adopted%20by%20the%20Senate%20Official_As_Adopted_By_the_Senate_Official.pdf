State of Vermont
Senate Chamber
Montpelier, Vermont
Joint Senate Resolution
Offered by Senator Baruth,
J.R.S. 13. Joint resolution establishing a procedure for the conduct of the election of the
University of Vermont and State Agricultural College trustees by plurality vote by the General
Assembly in 2025.
Whereas, in 1997 the election of three trustees of the University of Vermont and State
Agricultural College was decided by plurality vote, which required one ballot only, and
Whereas, in 1999 the election of three trustees of the University of Vermont and State
Agricultural College was decided by majority vote, which required a total of eight ballots, and
Whereas, in 2001 and subsequent bienniums the elections of three trustees of the University
of Vermont and State Agricultural College were decided by plurality vote, each of which
required one ballot only, and
Whereas, if an election for multiple vacancies is to be decided by a plurality vote, then a great
savings of time can be effectuated, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That, notwithstanding the current provisions of Joint Rule 10, and for this election only, the
election of three trustees of the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College at a Joint
Assembly to be held on February 20, 2025, shall be governed by the following procedure:
(1) All candidates for the office of trustee shall be voted upon and decided on the same
ballot; members may vote for any number of candidates up to and including the maximum
number of vacancies to be filled, which in this case shall be three.
(2) The three candidates receiving the most votes shall be declared elected to fill the three
vacancies.
(3) In the event that the first balloting for the trustee vacancies results in a tie vote for one
or more of the three vacant positions, then voting shall continue on successive ballots until the
vacancies have been filled, again by election declared of those candidates receiving the most
votes.
