12 An act relating to establishing the Farm and Forestry Operations Security
13 Special Fund to provide grants for losses to farms and forestry operations
14 due to weather conditions
15 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
16 Sec. 1. FINDINGS

1 (2) Many existing State and federal programs that are designed to
2 support farms and forestry operations are difficult to access, are
3 administratively burdensome, are not equitably distributed to small- and
4 medium-scale farmers and forestry operations, and currently do not meet the
5 needs of Vermont farmers and forestry operation in a holistic way.
6 (3) In particular, because federal crop insurance programs are not
7 designed to serve the needs of smaller scale or more diversified farming
8 operations, many Vermont farmers are not covered by crop insurance.
9 (4) The purpose of State funding should be to ensure that farms and
10 forestry operations remain viable in Vermont to ensure food security, climate
11 resilience, rural economic vitality, and environmental health.
12 (5) The State should be continuously investing in farms and forestry
13 operations in a way that makes them more resilient to current and future
14 challenges.
15 (6) The State should establish a permanent funding support program to:
16 (A) maintain the viability of farms and forestry operations in
17 Vermont in order to ensure food security, climate resilience, rural economic
18 vitality, and environmental health;
19 (B) continuously invest in farms and forestry operations in a way that
20 makes them more resilient to current and future challenges; and
