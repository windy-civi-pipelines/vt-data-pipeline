Whereas, on a chilly day in April 1975, Doug Casella took a pickup truck, which he
had purchased with money from jobs he held as a teenager, and began collecting garbage
from a few customers in Rutland and the Killington region, and in 1976, his younger
brother, John Casella, joined the company (Casella), and
Whereas, in 1977, Casella inaugurated Vermont’s first recycling facility, and this bold
decision triggered the development of a waste and resource management infrastructure
throughout the northeastern states, and
Whereas, in 1997, on an inauspicious morning immediately following a major stock
market downturn, Casella launched an extremely successful public stock offering, and
today, the corporation is listed on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol
“CWST,” and
Whereas, since 2000, resource management and sustainability have become
increasingly important corporate objectives, and
Whereas, in 2025, Casella, now officially known as Casella Waste Systems, Inc., has
over 5,000 employees, maintains operations in 10 states, and serves more than 1 million
customers in 46 states, and

Whereas, Casella was a charter member of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency’s 2005 Climate Leaders program, and today, it includes EV collection trucks in
its fleet, and
Whereas, in partnership with the University of Vermont, Casella established the
Casella Center for Circular Economy and Sustainability, an internationally recognized
research program for the study of sustainable waste and materials management, and
Whereas, Casella was delighted to be listed as one of Forbes Magazine’s 2025
America’s Best Midsized Employers; the only honoree in the waste management-
recycling industry and the only Vermont headquartered company, so recognized, and
Whereas, in 2020, the company established the Kenneth A. Heir Sr. CDL Training
Center, named after Casella’s first employee, which has trained over 300 employees as
commercially licensed drivers, and
Whereas, the Casella Foundation supervises the company’s giving initiatives and
annually contributes over $2 million to local communities, and the company’s employees
volunteer more than 14,000 hours each year towards worthy causes, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates Casella Waste Systems, Inc. on the
company’s 50th anniversary, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Casella Waste Systems, Inc.
