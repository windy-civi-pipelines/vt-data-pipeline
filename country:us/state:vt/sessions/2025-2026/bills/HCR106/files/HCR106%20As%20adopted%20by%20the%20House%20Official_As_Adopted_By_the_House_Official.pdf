House concurrent resolution congratulating the 2025 Mount Mansfield Union High School Cougars
dance program on winning a 10th consecutive hip-hop State championship
Whereas, under Vermont Principals’ Association guidelines, high school dance teams compete in
three categories: jazz, hip-hop, and pom, and
Whereas, at the State championship held this year at Vergennes Union High School on February 15,
2025, each team was required to compete in two of the three categories, and each category was limited
to a single round in which a team performed a routine consisting of three to 20 dancers, for a duration of
two to two and a half minutes, with a recorded musical accompaniment, and a champion was designated
for each of the three categories, and
Whereas, for the 10th consecutive year, the Cougars ranked supreme in the hip-hop category, and
they celebrated the additional bonus of achieving first place overall in scoring, narrowly outdistancing
second-place South Burlington 259–253, and
Whereas, the hip-hopping Cougars were Sophia Bellizia, Maddie Brown, Savannah Cohen, Gabby
Cowan, Hazel Fashing, Haley Kaleita, Sarah Ketover, Annie Marek, Zoey Marek, Anya Muller, Liza
Mundell, Munashe Pfende, Audrey Rogers, Arianna Stewart, and Zoey Van-Duyn, and
Whereas, coaches Rose Bedard, Lisa Russin, Addie Price, Ella Davis, and Edie Watson were superb
guides for the dancing Cougars, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2025 Mount Mansfield Union High School Cougars
dance program on winning a 10th consecutive hip-hop State championship, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to Mount
Mansfield Union High School.
