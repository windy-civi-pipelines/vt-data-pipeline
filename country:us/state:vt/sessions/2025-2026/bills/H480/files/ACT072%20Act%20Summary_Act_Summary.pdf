Act No. 72 (H.480). An act relating to miscellaneous amendments to education law
Subjects: Education; school safety; postsecondary schools; virtual learning;
BOCES; flexible pathways; Secretary of Education; State Board of Education;
literacy; National Guard Tuition Benefit Program; cardiac emergency response
plans; school libraries; therapeutic approved independent schools; cell-phones;
social media; career and technical education
This act makes several miscellaneous changes to Vermont education laws. It makes
amendments to the effective dates of portions of 2023 Acts and Resolves No. 29, 2023’s
school safety act, and amends the list of postsecondary schools that are accredited and
approved to operate in Vermont to reflect schools that no longer operate in Vermont or
have updated their name. It amends the cost thresholds at which school districts are
required to seek public bids, codifies the requirement for the Agency of Education (AOE)
to maintain access to and oversight of a virtual learning provider, and allows supervisory
unions that are exploring formation of a Board of Cooperative Education Services
(BOCES) to apply for and receive a start-up grant rather than waiting until after a
BOCES is already formed to be eligible for the grant. This act requires schools, when
providing students with postsecondary planning resources, to include resources and
information regarding the admissions process and requirements necessary to proceed with
any and all military-related opportunities. It further requires the Governor to send a letter
to the Chair of the State Board of Education (SBE) asking the Board to initiate the
candidate selection process for a new Secretary of Education not later than 30 days after
public notification of a vacancy or anticipated vacancy and for the SBE to begin a
national search not later than 60 days after receipt of a letter from the Governor
This act also amends the title of 16 V.S.A. § 2903 from “preventing early school
failure; reading instruction” to “foundation for literacy” and requires schools to provide
supplemental reading instruction to any enrolled student in grades kindergarten through
12 whose reading proficiency falls significantly below proficiency standards for the
student’s grade level or whose reading proficiency prevents progress in school. It
expands the Vermont National Guard Tuition Benefit Program to allow eligible members
to receive more than one undergraduate certificate, undergraduate degree, graduate
degree, or other credential recognized by VSAC under the Program, provided that the
cost of all certificates, degrees, and credentials received by the individual under the
Program does not exceed an amount equal to twice the full-time in-state tuition rate
charged by UVM for completion of an undergraduate baccalaureate degree. It requires
schools to maintain cardiac emergency response plans beginning in the 26–27 school year
and allows school districts to enter into energy performance contracts for a period not to
exceed 20 years without needing voter approval. It requires school boards to develop
policies for library material selection and superintendents to develop procedures for the
reconsideration and retention of library materials. It allows a therapeutic approved

independent school to maintain its approval status if it changes tax status or converts to a
nonprofit organization absent any other changes to the organization. This act also
requires the Agency of Education to develop a model policy that prohibits students from
using cell phones and non-school-issued personal electronic devices from arrival to
dismissal and prohibits public schools, approved independent schools, school districts,
and supervisory unions from using social media to communicate directly with students.
It also allows secondary students to apply for enrollment into programs offered at CTE
centers outside the student’s assigned service region when the center in the student’s
service region does not offer the program in which they wish to enroll or they are not able
to enroll in the program of their choice.
Multiple effective dates, beginning on June 27, 2025
