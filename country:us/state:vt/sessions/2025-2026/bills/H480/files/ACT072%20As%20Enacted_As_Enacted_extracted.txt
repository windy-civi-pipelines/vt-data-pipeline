§ 2903. PREVENTING EARLY SCHOOL FAILURE; READING
INSTRUCTION FOUNDATION FOR LITERACY

Children who fail to read by the end of the first grade will likely fall further
behind in school. The personal and economic costs of reading failure are
enormous both while the student remains in school and long afterward. All
students need to receive systematic and explicit evidence-based reading
instruction in the early grades from a teacher who is skilled in teaching the
foundational components of reading, including phonemic awareness, phonics,
fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. Students who require intensive
supplemental instruction tailored to the unique difficulties encountered shall be
provided those additional supports by an appropriately trained education
professional.
