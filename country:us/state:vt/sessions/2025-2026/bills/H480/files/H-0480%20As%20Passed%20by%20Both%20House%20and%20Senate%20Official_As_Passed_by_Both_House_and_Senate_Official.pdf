Sec. 10. 16 V.S.A. § 2903 is amended to read:
§ 2903. PREVENTING EARLY SCHOOL FAILURE; READING
INSTRUCTION FOUNDATION FOR LITERACY
(a) Statement of policy. The ability to read is critical to success in
learning. Children who fail to read by the end of the first grade will likely fall
further behind in school. The personal and economic costs of reading failure
are enormous both while the student remains in school and long afterward. All
students need to receive systematic and explicit evidence-based reading
instruction in the early grades from a teacher who is skilled in teaching the
foundational components of reading, including phonemic awareness, phonics,
fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. Students who require intensive
supplemental instruction tailored to the unique difficulties encountered shall be
provided those additional supports by an appropriately trained education
professional.

(c) Reading instruction. A public school or approved independent school
that is eligible to receive public tuition that offers instruction in grades
