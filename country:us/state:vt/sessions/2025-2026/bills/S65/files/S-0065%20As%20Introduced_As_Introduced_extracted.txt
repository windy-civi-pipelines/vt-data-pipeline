1 (A)(5) Regulated use of the Efficiency Fund. Balances in the Electric
2 Efficiency Fund shall be ratepayer funds, shall be used to support the activities
3 authorized in this subdivision in a fuel neutral manner, and shall be carried
4 forward and remain in the Fund at the end of each fiscal year. These monies
5 shall not be available to meet the general obligations of the State. Interest
6 earned shall remain in the Fund. The Commission will annually provide the
7 General Assembly with a report detailing the revenues collected and the
8 expenditures made for energy efficiency programs under this section. The
9 provisions of 2 V.S.A. § 20(d) (expiration of required reports) shall not apply
10 to the report to be made under this subsection (d).
11 (B)(A) The charge charges established by the Commission pursuant
12 to this subdivision (3)(5) shall be in an amount determined by the Commission
13 by rule or order that is consistent with the principles of least-cost integrated
14 planning as defined in section 218c of this title are societally cost-effective for
15 the purpose of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As circumstances and
16 programs evolve, the amount of the charge charges shall be reviewed for
17 unrealized energy efficiency potential and shall be adjusted as necessary in
18 order to realize all reasonably available, cost-effective energy efficiency
19 savings. In setting the amount of the charge and its allocation, the Commission
20 shall determine an appropriate balance among the following objectives;
21 provided, however, that particular emphasis shall be accorded to the first four
VT LEG #380343 v.3
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.65
2025 Page 8 of 18
1 of these objectives: prioritize the reduction of greenhouse gases and seek to
2 balance the other following objectives: reducing Vermont’s total energy
3 demand, consumption, and expenditures; reducing the size of future power
4 purchases; reducing the generation of greenhouse gases equitable distribution
5 of benefits using geographic and economic indicators; limiting the need to
6 upgrade the State’s transmission and distribution infrastructure; minimizing the
7 costs of electricity; reducing Vermont’s total energy demand, consumption,
8 and expenditures; providing efficiency and conservation as a part of a
9 comprehensive resource supply strategy that includes implementation of
10 beneficial electrification and energy storage system projects; providing the
11 opportunity for all Vermonters to participate in efficiency and conservation
12 programs; and targeting efficiency and conservation efforts to locations,
13 markets, or customers where they may provide the greatest value.
14 (C)(B) The Commission, by rule or order, shall establish a process by
15 which a customer who pays an average annual energy efficiency charge under
16 this subdivision (3)(5) of at least $5,000.00 may apply to the Commission to
17 self-administer energy efficiency through an energy savings account or
18 customer credit program that shall contain up to 75 percent and 90 percent,
19 respectively of the customer’s energy efficiency charge payments as
20 determined by the Commission. The remaining portion of the charge shall be
21 used for administrative, measurement, verification, and evaluation costs and
VT LEG #380343 v.3
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.65
2025 Page 9 of 18
1 for systemwide energy benefits. Customer energy efficiency funds may be
2 approved for use by the Commission for one or more of the following: electric
3 energy efficiency projects and non-electric nonelectric efficiency projects,
4 which may include thermal and process fuel efficiency, flexible load
5 management, combined heat and power systems, demand management, energy
6 productivity, and energy storage. These funds shall not be used for the
7 purchase or installation of new equipment capable of combusting fossil fuels.
8 The Commission in its rules or order shall establish criteria for each program
9 and approval of these applications, establish application and enrollment
10 periods, establish participant requirements, and establish the methodology for
11 evaluation, measurement, and verification for programs. The total amount of
12 customer energy efficiency funds that can be placed into energy savings
13 accounts or the customer credit program annually is $2,000,000.00 and
14 $1,000,000.00 respectively.
15 (D) The Commission may authorize the use of funds raised through
16 an energy efficiency charge on electric ratepayers to reduce the use of fossil
17 fuels for space heating by supporting electric technologies that may increase
18 electric consumption, such as air source or geothermal heat pumps if, after
19 investigation, it finds that deployment of the technology:
20 (i) will be beneficial to electric ratepayers as a whole;
VT LEG #380343 v.3
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.65
2025 Page 10 of 18
1 (ii) will result in cost-effective energy savings to the end-user and
2 to the State as a whole;
3 (iii) will result in a net reduction in State energy consumption and
4 greenhouse gas emissions on a life-cycle basis and will not have a detrimental
5 impact on the environment through other means such as release of refrigerants
6 or disposal. In making a finding under this subdivision, the Commission shall
7 consider the use of the technology at all times of year and any likely new
8 electricity demand created by such use;
9 (iv) will be part of a comprehensive energy efficiency and
10 conservation program that meets the requirements of subsections (d)-(g) of this
11 section and that makes support for the technology contingent on the energy
12 performance of the building in which the technology is to be installed. The
13 building’s energy performance shall achieve or shall be improved to achieve an
14 energy performance level that is approved by the Commission and that is
15 consistent with meeting or exceeding the goals of 10 V.S.A. § 581 (building
16 efficiency);
17 (v) among the product models of the technology that are suitable
18 for use in Vermont, will employ the product models that are the most efficient
19 available;
VT LEG #380343 v.3
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.65
2025 Page 11 of 18
1 (vi) will be promoted in conjunction with demand management
2 strategies offered by the customer’s distribution utility to address any increase
3 in peak electric consumption that may be caused by the deployment;
4 (vii) will be coordinated between the energy efficiency and
5 distribution utilities, consistent with subdivision (f)(5) of this section; and
6 (viii) will be supported by an appropriate allocation of funds
7 among the funding sources described in this subsection (d) and subsection (e)
8 of this section. In the case of measures used to increase the energy
9 performance of a building in which the technology is to be installed, the
10 Commission shall assume installation of the technology in the building and
11 then determine the allocation according to the proportion of the benefits
12 provided to the regulated fuel and unregulated fuel sectors. In this subdivision
13 (viii), “regulated fuel” and “unregulated fuel” shall have the same meaning as
14 under subsection (e) of this section.
15 (4)(6) Contract or order of appointment. Appointment of an entity
16 under subdivision (2) of this subsection may be by contract or by an order of
17 appointment. An appointment, whether by order of appointment or by
18 contract, may only be issued after notice and opportunity for hearing. An order
19 of appointment shall be for a limited duration not to exceed 12 years, although
20 an entity may be reappointed by order or contract. An order of appointment
21 may include any conditions and requirements that the Commission deems
VT LEG #380343 v.3
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.65
2025 Page 12 of 18
1 appropriate to promote the public good. For good cause, after notice and
2 opportunity for hearing, the Commission may amend or revoke an order of
3 appointment.
4 (5)(7) Appointed entity; supervision. Any entity appointed by order of
5 appointment under subdivisions (2) and (4)(6) of this subsection that is not an
6 electric or gas utility already regulated under this title shall not be considered
7 to be a company as defined under section 201 of this title but shall be subject
8 to the provisions of sections 18–21, 30–32, 205–208, subsection 209(a),
9 sections 219, 221, and subsection 231(b) of this title, to the same extent as a
10 company as defined under section 201 of this title. The Commission and the
11 Department of Public Service shall have jurisdiction under those sections over
12 the entity, its directors, receivers, trustees, lessees, or other persons or
13 companies owning or operating the entity and of all plants, equipment, and
14 property of that entity used in or about the business carried on by it in this
15 State as covered and included in this section. This jurisdiction shall be
16 exercised by the Commission and the Department so far as may be necessary
17 to enable them to perform the duties and exercise the powers conferred upon
18 them by law. The Commission and the Department each may, when they deem
19 the public good requires, examine the plants, equipment, and property of any
20 entity appointed by order of appointment under subdivisions (2) and (4) of this
21 subsection.

9 portfolio of services.
10 (D) On or before September 1, 2026, the appointed entity shall
11 propose and the Commission shall evaluate the appropriateness of a statewide
12 low-income energy efficiency rate for regulated fuels. The Commission may
13 consider the technical feasibility of implementation before approving such a
14 rate. For a distribution utility that is also an appointed entity, and has a
15 Commission approved discounted low-income rate, that appointed entity may
16 elect to apply its Commission approved discounted low-income rate criteria to
17 the energy efficiency charge in lieu of adopting a statewide low-income energy
18 efficiency rate.
19 (e) Thermal energy and process fuel efficiency funding.
20 (1) Each of the following shall be used to deliver thermal energy and
21 process fuel energy efficiency services in accordance with this section for

3 subdivision (d)(2)(B) of this section to use monies subject to this subsection
4 for the engineering, design, and construction of facilities for the conversion of
5 thermal energy customers using fossil fuels to district heat if the majority of
6 the district’s energy is from biomass sources, the district’s distribution system
7 is highly energy efficient, and such conversion is cost effective.
8 (A) Net revenues above costs associated with payments from the New
9 England Independent System Operator (ISO-NE) for capacity savings resulting
10 from the activities of the energy efficiency utility designated under subdivision
11 (2)(A) of this subsection (e) that are not transferred to the State PACE Reserve
12 Fund under 24 V.S.A. § 3270(c). These revenues shall be deposited into the
13 Electric Efficiency Fund established by this section. In delivering services with
14 respect to heating systems using the revenues subject to this subdivision (A),
15 the entity shall give priority to incentives for the installation of high efficiency
16 biomass heating systems and shall have a goal of offering an incentive that is
17 equal to 25 percent of the installed cost of such a system. Provision of an
18 incentive under this subdivision (A) for a biomass heating system shall not be
19 contingent on the making of other energy efficiency improvements at the
20 property on which the system will be installed.
VT LEG #380343 v.3

1 of these objectives: prioritize the reduction of greenhouse gases and seek to
2 balance the other following objectives: reducing Vermont’s total energy
3 demand, consumption, and expenditures; reducing the size of future power
4 purchases; reducing the generation of greenhouse gases equitable distribution
5 of benefits using geographic and economic indicators; limiting the need to
6 upgrade the State’s transmission and distribution infrastructure; minimizing the
7 costs of electricity; reducing Vermont’s total energy demand, consumption,
8 and expenditures; providing efficiency and conservation as a part of a
9 comprehensive resource supply strategy that includes implementation of
10 beneficial electrification and energy storage system projects; providing the
11 opportunity for all Vermonters to participate in efficiency and conservation
12 programs; and targeting efficiency and conservation efforts to locations,
13 markets, or customers where they may provide the greatest value.
14 (C)(B) The Commission, by rule or order, shall establish a process by
15 which a customer who pays an average annual energy efficiency charge under
16 this subdivision (3)(5) of at least $5,000.00 may apply to the Commission to
17 self-administer energy efficiency through an energy savings account or
18 customer credit program that shall contain up to 75 percent and 90 percent,
19 respectively of the customer’s energy efficiency charge payments as
20 determined by the Commission. The remaining portion of the charge shall be
21 used for administrative, measurement, verification, and evaluation costs and

12 customer energy efficiency funds that can be placed into energy savings
13 accounts or the customer credit program annually is $2,000,000.00 and
14 $1,000,000.00 respectively.
15 (D) The Commission may authorize the use of funds raised through
16 an energy efficiency charge on electric ratepayers to reduce the use of fossil
17 fuels for space heating by supporting electric technologies that may increase
18 electric consumption, such as air source or geothermal heat pumps if, after
19 investigation, it finds that deployment of the technology:
20 (i) will be beneficial to electric ratepayers as a whole;
VT LEG #380343 v.3

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.65
2025 Page 10 of 18
1 (ii) will result in cost-effective energy savings to the end-user and
2 to the State as a whole;
3 (iii) will result in a net reduction in State energy consumption and
4 greenhouse gas emissions on a life-cycle basis and will not have a detrimental
5 impact on the environment through other means such as release of refrigerants
6 or disposal. In making a finding under this subdivision, the Commission shall
7 consider the use of the technology at all times of year and any likely new
8 electricity demand created by such use;
9 (iv) will be part of a comprehensive energy efficiency and
10 conservation program that meets the requirements of subsections (d)-(g) of this
11 section and that makes support for the technology contingent on the energy
12 performance of the building in which the technology is to be installed. The
13 building’s energy performance shall achieve or shall be improved to achieve an
14 energy performance level that is approved by the Commission and that is
15 consistent with meeting or exceeding the goals of 10 V.S.A. § 581 (building
16 efficiency);

2 strategies offered by the customer’s distribution utility to address any increase
3 in peak electric consumption that may be caused by the deployment;
4 (vii) will be coordinated between the energy efficiency and
5 distribution utilities, consistent with subdivision (f)(5) of this section; and
6 (viii) will be supported by an appropriate allocation of funds
7 among the funding sources described in this subsection (d) and subsection (e)
8 of this section. In the case of measures used to increase the energy
9 performance of a building in which the technology is to be installed, the
10 Commission shall assume installation of the technology in the building and
11 then determine the allocation according to the proportion of the benefits
12 provided to the regulated fuel and unregulated fuel sectors. In this subdivision
13 (viii), “regulated fuel” and “unregulated fuel” shall have the same meaning as
14 under subsection (e) of this section.
15 (4)(6) Contract or order of appointment. Appointment of an entity
16 under subdivision (2) of this subsection may be by contract or by an order of
17 appointment. An appointment, whether by order of appointment or by
18 contract, may only be issued after notice and opportunity for hearing. An order
19 of appointment shall be for a limited duration not to exceed 12 years, although
20 an entity may be reappointed by order or contract. An order of appointment
21 may include any conditions and requirements that the Commission deems
VT LEG #380343 v.3

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.65

8 to the provisions of sections 18–21, 30–32, 205–208, subsection 209(a),
9 sections 219, 221, and subsection 231(b) of this title, to the same extent as a
10 company as defined under section 201 of this title. The Commission and the
11 Department of Public Service shall have jurisdiction under those sections over
12 the entity, its directors, receivers, trustees, lessees, or other persons or
13 companies owning or operating the entity and of all plants, equipment, and
14 property of that entity used in or about the business carried on by it in this
15 State as covered and included in this section. This jurisdiction shall be
16 exercised by the Commission and the Department so far as may be necessary
17 to enable them to perform the duties and exercise the powers conferred upon
18 them by law. The Commission and the Department each may, when they deem

9 England Independent System Operator (ISO-NE) for capacity savings resulting
10 from the activities of the energy efficiency utility designated under subdivision
11 (2)(A) of this subsection (e) that are not transferred to the State PACE Reserve
12 Fund under 24 V.S.A. § 3270(c). These revenues shall be deposited into the
13 Electric Efficiency Fund established by this section. In delivering services with
14 respect to heating systems using the revenues subject to this subdivision (A),
15 the entity shall give priority to incentives for the installation of high efficiency
16 biomass heating systems and shall have a goal of offering an incentive that is
17 equal to 25 percent of the installed cost of such a system. Provision of an
18 incentive under this subdivision (A) for a biomass heating system shall not be
19 contingent on the making of other energy efficiency improvements at the
20 property on which the system will be installed.
