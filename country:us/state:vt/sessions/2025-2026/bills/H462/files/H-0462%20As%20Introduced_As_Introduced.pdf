1 The City Council shall have power:
2 * * *
3 (67)(A) To provide by ordinance protections for residential tenants, as
4 defined in 9 V.S.A. chapter 137, from eviction without “just cause,” where
5 “just cause” shall include:
6 (i) a tenant’s material breach of a written rental agreement;
7 (ii) a tenant’s violation of State statutes regulating tenant
8 obligations in residential rental agreements;
9 (iii) nonpayment of rent; and
10 (iv) a tenant’s failure to accept written, reasonable, good faith
11 renewal terms.
12 (B) The ordinance shall exclude from “just cause” the expiration of a
13 rental agreement as the sole grounds for termination of tenancy. In addition to
14 the exemptions in 9 V.S.A. chapter 137, the ordinance shall exempt from this
15 provision, subject to mitigation provisions, sublets and in-unit rentals as well
16 as the following properties, but not limited to:
17 (i) owner-occupied duplexes and triplexes;
18 (ii) those being withdrawn from the rental market, including
19 properties to be occupied by the owner or an immediate family member as a

1 (iii) those in need of substantial renovations that preclude
2 occupancy.
3 (C) The ordinance shall include provisions that:
4 (i) mitigate potential negative impacts on tenants and property
5 owners, including requirements of adequate notice and reasonable relocation
6 expenses;
7 (ii) provide for a reasonable probationary period after initial
8 occupancy; and
9 (iii) limit unreasonable rent increases to prevent de facto evictions
10 or nonrenewals, although this shall not be construed to limit rents beyond the
11 purpose of preventing individual evictions.
12 (D) The ordinance shall define what is “reasonable” and “adequate
13 notice” in defining “just cause” and shall require that landlords provide notice
14 of just cause and other legal requirements as part of the rental agreement.
