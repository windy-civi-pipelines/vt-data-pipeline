Act No. 37 (H.481). An act relating to stormwater management
Subjects: Conservation and development; water quality; stormwater; three-acre
permit
This act amends requirements related to the permitting of stormwater systems in the
State. The act allows municipalities that assume full legal responsibility for a stormwater
system to assess municipal special assessment fees on users of the stormwater system.
The act extends the deadline by which owners of impervious surface subject to the three-
acre impervious surface permit must complete permitting. In the Lake Champlain, Lake
Memphremagog, and stormwater impaired watersheds, the deadline for permit
compliance is extended to October 1, 2028. In all other watersheds, the permit deadline
is extended to October 1, 2038, or not later than five years after a binding stormwater-
specific waste-load allocation has been established for that watershed, whichever occurs
first.
The act also repeals the sunset of the clean water surcharge on the property transfer tax
and makes several conforming changes to legislation related to use of the clean water
surcharge. The act amends the eligibility criteria for the Municipal Stormwater
Implementation Program and the Developed Lands Implementation Program and clarifies
that both Programs are available to provide financial assistance for compliance with the
three-acre stormwater permit. The act also provides that the Clean Water Board shall
recommend at least $1,000,000.00 annually for the Municipal Stormwater
Implementation Program until October 1, 2032, and the act requires the Clean Water
Board to recommend $5,000,000.00 for the Municipal Stormwater Implementation
Program in fiscal year 2027.
The act requires the Secretary of Natural Resources to publish a Public Resource
Guide to Stormwater Management that provides to persons subject to stormwater
operation permits information and resources related to compliance with permit
requirements. The act also creates the Study Committee on Stormwater Management and
Creation of Regional Stormwater Utility Districts to review the feasibility and benefit of
creating regional stormwater utility districts to facilitate implementation and compliance
with the water quality laws of the State.
