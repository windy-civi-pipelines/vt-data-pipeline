3 Date:
4 Subject: Conservation and development; water quality; stormwater; three-acre
5 permit
6 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to amend
7 requirements related to the permitting of stormwater systems in the State. The
8 bill would extend the deadline by which owners of impervious surface subject
9 to the three-acre impervious surface permit must complete permitting. The bill
10 also would allow municipalities that assume full legal responsibility for a
11 stormwater system to assess municipal impact fees on users of the stormwater
12 system. In addition, the bill repeals the sunset of the clean water surcharge on
13 the property transfer tax. The bill also would create the Study Committee on
14 the Creation of Regional Stormwater Utility Districts to review the feasibility
15 and benefit of creating regional stormwater utility districts to facilitate
16 implementation and compliance with the water quality laws of the State.
17 An act relating to stormwater management
18 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
19 Sec. 1. 10 V.S.A. § 1264 is amended to read:

4 (2) No permit is required under subdivision (c)(1), (5), or (7) of this
5 section and for which a municipality has assumed full legal responsibility as
6 part of a permit issued to the municipality by the Secretary. As used in this
7 subdivision, “full legal responsibility” means legal control of the stormwater
8 system, including a legal right to access the stormwater system, a legal duty to
9 properly maintain the stormwater system, and a legal duty to repair and replace
10 the stormwater system when it no longer adequately protects waters of the
11 State. Notwithstanding the provisions of 24 V.S.A. § 3254 to the contrary,
12 when a municipality assumes full legal responsibility for a stormwater system,
13 the municipality may assess municipal impact fees on users of the stormwater
14 system provided that a majority of the property owners subject to the impact
15 fee consented and the impact fee assessed is a fair apportionment to the user of
16 the cost of the improvement in accordance with the benefits the user received.

20 (3) Within 120 days after the adoption by the Secretary of the rules
21 required under subsection (f) of this section, the Secretary shall issue a general
VT LEG #381286 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.481
2025 Page 3 of 16
1 permit under this section for discharges of stormwater from impervious surface
2 of three or more acres in size, when the stormwater discharge previously was
3 not permitted or was permitted under an individual permit or general permit
4 that did not incorporate the requirements of the 2002 Stormwater Management
5 Manual or any subsequently adopted Stormwater Management Manual. Under
6 the general permit, the Secretary shall:
7 (A) Establish a schedule for implementation of the general permit by
8 geographic area of the State. The schedule shall establish the date by which an
9 owner of impervious surface shall apply for coverage under this subdivision
10 (3). The schedule established by the Secretary shall require an owner of
11 impervious surface subject to permitting under this subdivision to obtain
12 coverage by the following dates:
13 (i) for impervious surface located within the Lake Champlain
14 watershed, the Lake Memphremagog watershed, or the watershed of a
15 stormwater-impaired water on or before October 1, 2023 2028; and
16 (ii) for impervious surface located within all other watersheds of
17 the State, no not later than October 1, 2033 2038 or not later than five years
18 after a binding stormwater-specific waste-load allocation has been established
19 for that watershed, whichever occurs first.
20 (B) Establish criteria and technical standards, such as best
21 management practices, for implementation of stormwater improvements for the
