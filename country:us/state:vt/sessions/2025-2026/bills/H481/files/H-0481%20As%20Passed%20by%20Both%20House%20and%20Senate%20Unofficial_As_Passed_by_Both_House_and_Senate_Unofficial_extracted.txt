6 * * *
7 (c) Prohibitions.
8 * * *
9 (7) In accordance with the schedule established under subdivision (g)(3)
10 of this section, a person shall not discharge stormwater from impervious
11 surface of three or more acres in size without first obtaining an individual
12 permit or coverage under a general permit issued under this section if the
13 discharge was never previously permitted or was permitted under an individual
14 permit or general permit that did not incorporate the requirements of the 2002
15 Stormwater Management Manual or any subsequently adopted Stormwater
16 Management Manual. The Secretary shall provide notice to all owners of
17 property subject to the permit required under this subdivision.
18 (d) Exemptions.
19 * * *
20 (2) No permit is required under subdivision (c)(1), (5), or (7) of this
21 section and for which a municipality has assumed full legal responsibility as
22 part of a permit issued to the municipality by the Secretary. As used in this
VT LEG #383682 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.481

1 subdivision, “full legal responsibility” means legal control of the stormwater
2 system, including a legal right to access the stormwater system, a legal duty to
3 properly maintain the stormwater system, and a legal duty to repair and replace
4 the stormwater system when it no longer adequately protects waters of the
5 State. Notwithstanding the provisions of 24 V.S.A. § 3254 to the contrary,
6 when a municipality assumes or has assumed full legal responsibility for a
7 stormwater system, the municipality may assess municipal special assessment
8 fees on users of the stormwater system provided that a majority of the property
9 owners subject to the special assessment fee consented and the fee assessed is a
10 fair apportionment to the user of the cost of the improvement in accordance
11 with the benefits the user received.
12 * * *
13 (g) General permits.
14 * * *
15 (3) Within 120 days after the adoption by the Secretary of the rules
16 required under subsection (f) of this section, the Secretary shall issue a general
17 permit under this section for discharges of stormwater from impervious surface
18 of three or more acres in size, when the stormwater discharge previously was
19 not permitted or was permitted under an individual permit or general permit
20 that did not incorporate the requirements of the 2002 Stormwater Management

4 allocate resources and cost-effectively and equitably achieve pollutant
5 reduction measures that are not fully achieved by regulated sites, as might be
6 articulated in a regional stormwater management plan; and
7 (E) recommend whether and how a regional stormwater utility could
8 improve the management of parcel-based issues in a more cost-effective and
9 equitable manner, such as how a regional utility could address regulation of
10 stormwater systems lacking a homeowners’ association or other accountable
11 entity or how a regional utility could improve management of upstream
12 properties that drain into stormwater systems subject to permitting;
13 (4) recommend whether stormwater permitting for municipalities or
14 others could be streamlined to improve the application process, permit
15 renewal, or fee requirements;

6 * * *
7 (c) Prohibitions.
8 * * *
9 (7) In accordance with the schedule established under subdivision (g)(3)
10 of this section, a person shall not discharge stormwater from impervious
11 surface of three or more acres in size without first obtaining an individual
12 permit or coverage under a general permit issued under this section if the
13 discharge was never previously permitted or was permitted under an individual
14 permit or general permit that did not incorporate the requirements of the 2002
15 Stormwater Management Manual or any subsequently adopted Stormwater
16 Management Manual. The Secretary shall provide notice to all owners of
17 property subject to the permit required under this subdivision.
18 (d) Exemptions.
19 * * *
20 (2) No permit is required under subdivision (c)(1), (5), or (7) of this
21 section and for which a municipality has assumed full legal responsibility as
22 part of a permit issued to the municipality by the Secretary. As used in this
VT LEG #383682 v.1

1 subdivision, “full legal responsibility” means legal control of the stormwater
2 system, including a legal right to access the stormwater system, a legal duty to
3 properly maintain the stormwater system, and a legal duty to repair and replace
4 the stormwater system when it no longer adequately protects waters of the
5 State. Notwithstanding the provisions of 24 V.S.A. § 3254 to the contrary,
6 when a municipality assumes or has assumed full legal responsibility for a
7 stormwater system, the municipality may assess municipal special assessment
8 fees on users of the stormwater system provided that a majority of the property
9 owners subject to the special assessment fee consented and the fee assessed is a
10 fair apportionment to the user of the cost of the improvement in accordance
11 with the benefits the user received.
12 * * *
13 (g) General permits.
14 * * *
15 (3) Within 120 days after the adoption by the Secretary of the rules
16 required under subsection (f) of this section, the Secretary shall issue a general
17 permit under this section for discharges of stormwater from impervious surface
18 of three or more acres in size, when the stormwater discharge previously was
19 not permitted or was permitted under an individual permit or general permit
20 that did not incorporate the requirements of the 2002 Stormwater Management
