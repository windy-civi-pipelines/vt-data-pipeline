It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
Sec. 1. 10 V.S.A. § 1264 is amended to read:

Section 2:
§ 1264. STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
* * *
(c) Prohibitions.
* * *
(7) In accordance with the schedule established under subdivision (g)(3)
of this section, a person shall not discharge stormwater from impervious
surface of three or more acres in size without first obtaining an individual
permit or coverage under a general permit issued under this section if the
discharge was never previously permitted or was permitted under an individual
permit or general permit that did not incorporate the requirements of the 2002
Stormwater Management Manual or any subsequently adopted Stormwater
Management Manual. The Secretary shall provide notice to all owners of
property subject to the permit required under this subdivision.
(d) Exemptions.
* * *
(2) No permit is required under subdivision (c)(1), (5), or (7) of this

Section 3:
section and for which a municipality has assumed full legal responsibility as
part of a permit issued to the municipality by the Secretary. As used in this
VT LEG #384094 v.1
No. 37 Page 2 of 19
2025
subdivision, “full legal responsibility” means legal control of the stormwater
system, including a legal right to access the stormwater system, a legal duty to
properly maintain the stormwater system, and a legal duty to repair and replace
the stormwater system when it no longer adequately protects waters of the
State. Notwithstanding the provisions of 24 V.S.A. § 3254 to the contrary,
when a municipality assumes or has assumed full legal responsibility for a
stormwater system, the municipality may assess municipal special assessment
fees on users of the stormwater system provided that a majority of the property
owners subject to the special assessment fee consented and the fee assessed is a
fair apportionment to the user of the cost of the improvement in accordance
with the benefits the user received.
* * *
(g) General permits.
* * *
(3) Within 120 days after the adoption by the Secretary of the rules
required under subsection (f) of this section, the Secretary shall issue a general
permit under this section for discharges of stormwater from impervious surface
of three or more acres in size, when the stormwater discharge previously was
not permitted or was permitted under an individual permit or general permit
that did not incorporate the requirements of the 2002 Stormwater Management
Manual or any subsequently adopted Stormwater Management Manual. Under
the general permit, the Secretary shall:
VT LEG #384094 v.1
No. 37 Page 3 of 19
2025
(A) Establish a schedule for implementation of the general permit by
geographic area of the State. The schedule shall establish the date by which an
owner of impervious surface shall apply for coverage under this subdivision
(3). The schedule established by the Secretary shall require an owner of
impervious surface subject to permitting under this subdivision to obtain
coverage by the following dates:
(i) for impervious surface located within the Lake Champlain
watershed, the Lake Memphremagog watershed, or the watershed of a
stormwater-impaired water on or before October 1, 2023 2028; and
(ii) for impervious surface located within all other watersheds of
the State, no not later than October 1, 2033 2038 or not later than five years
after a binding stormwater-specific waste-load allocation has been established
for that watershed, whichever occurs first.
(B) Establish criteria and technical standards, such as best
management practices, for implementation of stormwater improvements for the
retrofitting of impervious surface subject to permitting under this subdivision
(3).
(C) Require that a discharge of stormwater from impervious surface
subject to the requirements of this section comply with the standards of
subsection (h) of this section for redevelopment of or renewal of a permit for
existing impervious surface.

No. 37 Page 16 of 19
2025
(c) Powers and duties. The Study Committee shall review the feasibility of
establishing regional stormwater utility districts in the State. The Study
Committee shall:
(1) review current statutory authority for the development of regional
stormwater utility districts comprised of multiple municipalities, including
identifying any potential disincentives or obstacles to utility formation;
(2) propose an approach the State could use for implementing a regional
stormwater utility that would allow the utilities to assume liability and
responsibility for compliance with water quality laws, including how a utility
could assume responsibility for:
(A) securing the permitting of properties subject to the three-acre
stormwater permit; and
(B) achieving the phosphorus reduction targets for the three-acre
stormwater permitted properties within the utility district;
(3) review and recommend cost-effective and equitable approaches for
regional level revenue raising and distribution of project funding for the
purpose of stormwater controls to meet total maximum daily load plans
(TMDLs) including:
(A) consider prior revenue-raising recommendations made in the
2017 Clean Water Report from the Office of the State Treasurer;
(B) recommend whether and how to authorize a regional stormwater
utility to assess fees or charges to all landowners, residents, and businesses
VT LEG #384094 v.1
No. 37 Page 17 of 19
2025
within the regional stormwater utility district for the purpose of stormwater
controls to meet TMDLs;
(C) propose how a regional stormwater utility district could be
eligible for Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund awards and access State-
level financial assistance for the design, construction, and operation and
maintenance of regulatory and nonregulatory stormwater systems, including
from the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund;
(D) recommend whether and how a regional stormwater utility can
allocate resources and cost-effectively and equitably achieve pollutant
reduction measures that are not fully achieved by regulated sites, as might be
articulated in a regional stormwater management plan; and
(E) recommend whether and how a regional stormwater utility could
improve the management of parcel-based issues in a more cost-effective and
equitable manner, such as how a regional utility could address regulation of
stormwater systems lacking a homeowners’ association or other accountable
entity or how a regional utility could improve management of upstream
properties that drain into stormwater systems subject to permitting;
(4) recommend whether stormwater permitting for municipalities or
others could be streamlined to improve the application process, permit
renewal, or fee requirements;
VT LEG #384094 v.1
No. 37 Page 18 of 19
2025
(5) propose how statute should be amended to implement any of the
recommendations of the Study Committee, including stormwater management
planning for purposes of overall regional phosphorus pollutant reductions; and
(6) estimate a cost to operate proposed regional stormwater utility
districts.

(c) Powers and duties. The Study Committee shall review the feasibility of
establishing regional stormwater utility districts in the State. The Study
Committee shall:
(1) review current statutory authority for the development of regional
stormwater utility districts comprised of multiple municipalities, including
identifying any potential disincentives or obstacles to utility formation;
(2) propose an approach the State could use for implementing a regional
stormwater utility that would allow the utilities to assume liability and
responsibility for compliance with water quality laws, including how a utility
could assume responsibility for:
(A) securing the permitting of properties subject to the three-acre
stormwater permit; and
(B) achieving the phosphorus reduction targets for the three-acre
stormwater permitted properties within the utility district;
(3) review and recommend cost-effective and equitable approaches for
regional level revenue raising and distribution of project funding for the
purpose of stormwater controls to meet total maximum daily load plans
(TMDLs) including:

eligible for Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund awards and access State-
level financial assistance for the design, construction, and operation and
maintenance of regulatory and nonregulatory stormwater systems, including
from the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund;
(D) recommend whether and how a regional stormwater utility can
allocate resources and cost-effectively and equitably achieve pollutant
reduction measures that are not fully achieved by regulated sites, as might be
articulated in a regional stormwater management plan; and
(E) recommend whether and how a regional stormwater utility could
improve the management of parcel-based issues in a more cost-effective and
equitable manner, such as how a regional utility could address regulation of
stormwater systems lacking a homeowners’ association or other accountable
entity or how a regional utility could improve management of upstream
properties that drain into stormwater systems subject to permitting;
(4) recommend whether stormwater permitting for municipalities or
others could be streamlined to improve the application process, permit
renewal, or fee requirements;
VT LEG #384094 v.1

No. 37 Page 18 of 19
2025
