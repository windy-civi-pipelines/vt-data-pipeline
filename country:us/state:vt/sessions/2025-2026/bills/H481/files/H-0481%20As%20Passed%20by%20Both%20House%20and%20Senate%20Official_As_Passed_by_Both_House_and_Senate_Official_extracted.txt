5 permit
6 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to amend
7 requirements related to the permitting of stormwater systems in the State. The
8 bill would extend the deadline by which owners of impervious surface subject
9 to the three-acre impervious surface permit must complete permitting. The bill
10 also would allow municipalities that assume full legal responsibility for a
11 stormwater system to assess municipal impact fees on users of the stormwater
12 system. In addition, the bill repeals the sunset of the clean water surcharge on
13 the property transfer tax. The bill also would create the Study Committee on
14 the Creation of Regional Stormwater Utility Districts to review the feasibility
15 and benefit of creating regional stormwater utility districts to facilitate
16 implementation and compliance with the water quality laws of the State.
17 An act relating to stormwater management
18 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:

5 (2) No permit is required under subdivision (c)(1), (5), or (7) of this
6 section and for which a municipality has assumed full legal responsibility as
7 part of a permit issued to the municipality by the Secretary. As used in this
8 subdivision, “full legal responsibility” means legal control of the stormwater
9 system, including a legal right to access the stormwater system, a legal duty to
10 properly maintain the stormwater system, and a legal duty to repair and replace
11 the stormwater system when it no longer adequately protects waters of the
12 State. Notwithstanding the provisions of 24 V.S.A. § 3254 to the contrary,
13 when a municipality assumes full legal responsibility for a stormwater system,
14 the municipality may assess municipal impact fees on users of the stormwater
15 system provided that a majority of the property owners subject to the impact
16 fee consented and the impact fee assessed is a fair apportionment to the user of
17 the cost of the improvement in accordance with the benefits the user received.

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE AND SENATE H.481
2025 Page 33 of 36
(2) propose an approach the State could use for implementing a
regional stormwater utility that would allow the utilities to assume liability
and responsibility for compliance with water quality laws, including how a
utility could assume responsibility for:
(A) securing the permitting of properties subject to the three-acre
stormwater permit; and
(B) achieving the phosphorus reduction targets for the three-acre
stormwater permitted properties within the utility district;
(3) review and recommend cost-effective and equitable approaches for
regional level revenue raising and distribution of project funding for the
purpose of stormwater controls to meet total maximum daily load plans
(TMDLs) including:
(A) consider prior revenue-raising recommendations made in the
2017 Clean Water Report from the Office of the State Treasurer;
(B) recommend whether and how to authorize a regional stormwater
utility to assess fees or charges to all landowners, residents, and businesses
within the regional stormwater utility district for the purpose of stormwater
controls to meet TMDLs;
(C) propose how a regional stormwater utility district could be
eligible for Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund awards and access State-
level financial assistance for the design, construction, and operation and
BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE AND SENATE H.481
2025 Page 34 of 36
maintenance of regulatory and nonregulatory stormwater systems, including
from the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund;
(D) recommend whether and how a regional stormwater utility can
allocate resources and cost-effectively and equitably achieve pollutant
reduction measures that are not fully achieved by regulated sites, as might be
articulated in a regional stormwater management plan; and
(E) recommend whether and how a regional stormwater utility could
improve the management of parcel-based issues in a more cost-effective and
equitable manner, such as how a regional utility could address regulation of
stormwater systems lacking a homeowners’ association or other accountable
entity or how a regional utility could improve management of upstream
properties that drain into stormwater systems subject to permitting;
(4) recommend whether stormwater permitting for municipalities or
others could be streamlined to improve the application process, permit
renewal, or fee requirements;
(5) propose how statute should be amended to implement any of the
recommendations of the Study Committee, including stormwater management
planning for purposes of overall regional phosphorus pollutant reductions;
and
(6) estimate a cost to operate proposed regional stormwater utility
districts.

2 Introduced by Committee on Environment
3 Date:
4 Subject: Conservation and development; water quality; stormwater; three-acre
5 permit
6 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to amend
7 requirements related to the permitting of stormwater systems in the State. The
8 bill would extend the deadline by which owners of impervious surface subject
9 to the three-acre impervious surface permit must complete permitting. The bill
10 also would allow municipalities that assume full legal responsibility for a
11 stormwater system to assess municipal impact fees on users of the stormwater
12 system. In addition, the bill repeals the sunset of the clean water surcharge on
13 the property transfer tax. The bill also would create the Study Committee on
14 the Creation of Regional Stormwater Utility Districts to review the feasibility
15 and benefit of creating regional stormwater utility districts to facilitate
16 implementation and compliance with the water quality laws of the State.
17 An act relating to stormwater management
18 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
19 Sec. 1. 10 V.S.A. § 1264 is amended to read:

2 * * *
3 (d) Exemptions.
4 * * *
5 (2) No permit is required under subdivision (c)(1), (5), or (7) of this
6 section and for which a municipality has assumed full legal responsibility as
7 part of a permit issued to the municipality by the Secretary. As used in this
8 subdivision, “full legal responsibility” means legal control of the stormwater
9 system, including a legal right to access the stormwater system, a legal duty to
10 properly maintain the stormwater system, and a legal duty to repair and replace
11 the stormwater system when it no longer adequately protects waters of the
12 State. Notwithstanding the provisions of 24 V.S.A. § 3254 to the contrary,
13 when a municipality assumes full legal responsibility for a stormwater system,
14 the municipality may assess municipal impact fees on users of the stormwater
15 system provided that a majority of the property owners subject to the impact
16 fee consented and the impact fee assessed is a fair apportionment to the user of
17 the cost of the improvement in accordance with the benefits the user received.

1 (3) Within 120 days after the adoption by the Secretary of the rules
2 required under subsection (f) of this section, the Secretary shall issue a general
3 permit under this section for discharges of stormwater from impervious surface
4 of three or more acres in size, when the stormwater discharge previously was
5 not permitted or was permitted under an individual permit or general permit
6 that did not incorporate the requirements of the 2002 Stormwater Management
7 Manual or any subsequently adopted Stormwater Management Manual. Under
8 the general permit, the Secretary shall:
9 (A) Establish a schedule for implementation of the general permit by
10 geographic area of the State. The schedule shall establish the date by which an
11 owner of impervious surface shall apply for coverage under this subdivision
12 (3). The schedule established by the Secretary shall require an owner of
13 impervious surface subject to permitting under this subdivision to obtain
14 coverage by the following dates:
15 (i) for impervious surface located within the Lake Champlain
16 watershed, the Lake Memphremagog watershed, or the watershed of a
17 stormwater-impaired water on or before October 1, 2023 2028; and
18 (ii) for impervious surface located within all other watersheds of
19 the State, no not later than October 1, 2033 2038 or not later than five years
20 after a binding stormwater-specific waste-load allocation has been established
21 for that watershed, whichever occurs first.

1 (B) Establish criteria and technical standards, such as best
2 management practices, for implementation of stormwater improvements for
3 the retrofitting of impervious surface subject to permitting under this
4 subdivision (3).
5 (C) Require that a discharge of stormwater from impervious surface
6 subject to the requirements of this section comply with the standards of
7 subsection (h) of this section for redevelopment of or renewal of a permit for
8 existing impervious surface.
9 (D) Allow the use of stormwater impact fees, offsets, and phosphorus
10 credit trading within the watershed of the water to which the stormwater
11 discharges or runs off.
