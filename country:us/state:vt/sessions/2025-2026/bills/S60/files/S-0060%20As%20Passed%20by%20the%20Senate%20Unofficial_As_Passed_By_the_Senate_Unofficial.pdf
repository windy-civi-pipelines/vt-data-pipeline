2 An act relating to establishing the Farm Security Special Fund to provide
3 grants for farm losses due to weather conditions
4 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
5 Sec. 1. FINDINGS
6 The General Assembly finds that:
7 (1) In 2023 and 2024, Vermont experienced extreme flooding and other
8 climate-fueled disasters that devastated farms and other working lands
9 businesses across the State.
10 (2) Many existing State and federal programs that are designed to
11 support farms are difficult to access, are administratively burdensome, and
12 currently do not meet the needs of Vermont farmers in a holistic way.
13 (3) In particular, because federal crop insurance programs are not
14 designed to serve the needs of smaller scale or more diversified farming
15 operations, many Vermont farmers are not covered by crop insurance.
16 (4) The State should establish a permanent funding support program to:
17 (A) maintain the viability of farms in Vermont in order to ensure
18 food security, climate resilience, rural economic vitality, and environmental
19 health;
20 (B) continuously invest in farms in a way that makes them more
21 resilient to current and future challenges; and
