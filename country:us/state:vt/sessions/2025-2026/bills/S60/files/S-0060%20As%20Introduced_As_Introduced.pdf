6 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to establish the
7 Farm Security Special Fund to provide financial assistance to farms that
8 experienced qualifying losses due to weather conditions.
9 An act relating to establishing the Farm Security Special Fund to provide
10 grants for farm losses due to weather conditions
11 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
12 Sec. 1. FINDINGS
13 The General Assembly finds that:
14 (1) In 2023 and 2024, Vermont experienced extreme flooding and other
15 climate-fueled disasters that devastated farms and other working lands
16 businesses across the State.
17 (2) Many existing State and federal programs that are designed to
18 support farms are difficult to access, are administratively burdensome, are not
19 equitably distributed to small- and medium-scale farmers, and currently do not
20 meet the needs of Vermont farmers in a holistic way.
VT LEG #379703 v.1

1 (3) In particular, because federal crop insurance programs are not
2 designed to serve the needs of smaller scale or more diversified farming
3 operations, many Vermont farmers are not covered by crop insurance.
4 (4) The State should establish a permanent funding support program to:
5 (A) maintain the viability of farms in Vermont in order to ensure
6 food security, climate resilience, rural economic vitality, and environmental
7 health;
8 (B) continuously invest in farms in a way that makes them more
9 resilient to current and future challenges; and
10 (C) provide a source of relief funds permanently available to farmers
11 impacted by climate emergencies and extreme weather.
12 Sec. 2. 6 V.S.A. chapter 207 is amended to read:
