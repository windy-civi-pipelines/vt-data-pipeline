9 unfair commercial practice, requiring certain rental agreements to be in
10 writing, limiting no-cause evictions and annual rent increases, creating a rental
11 registry, creating the Office of Tenant’s Rights Advocate, providing for the
12 right to counsel in eviction proceedings and the expungement of eviction
13 records, and affording tenants the right to receive notice of a landlord’s intent
14 to sell an apartment building and to negotiate in good faith and purchase the
15 building with a down payment revolving fund administered by the Vermont
16 Housing and Conservation Board. The bill also proposes to add citizenship
