9 trade, or business or substantially all of the assets of any employer who has
10 been operating the business within two weeks prior to the acquisition, except
11 any assets retained by the employer incident to the liquidation of the

14 business was acquired and, if not already an employer before the acquisition,
15 shall become an employer on the date of the acquisition. The Commissioner
16 shall transfer the experience-rating record of the predecessor employer to the
17 successor employer. If the successor was not an employer before the date of
18 acquisition, the successor’s rate of contribution for the remainder of the rate
19 year shall be the rate applicable to the predecessor employers with respect to
20 the period immediately preceding the date of acquisition if there was only one

5 occurred will remain assigned to the successor for the remainder of the rate
6 year, after which the experience-rating record of the predecessor shall be

14 organization, trade, or business or substantially all of the assets of any
15 employing unit who was an employer before the date of acquisition and whose
16 currently assigned contribution rate is higher than that currently assigned to the
17 acquiring individual or employing unit shall not be treated as a successor.

20 or more corporate entities, the successor shall designate one of the corporate
21 entities involved in successor’s business operations as the filing successor for

2025 Page 19 of 22
1 purposes of quarterly wage reporting and benefit rate assignment. The

14 preceding calendar year by the total wages paid for employment during that
15 calendar year as reported by employers by the following March 31.

18 period that ended within the 10-year period ending on the preceding December
19 31, by the total wages paid during the four calendar quarter periods that ended

5 subdivision (d)(2) to the contrary, when computing the taxrate schedule to
6 become effective on July 1, 2021 and on each subsequent July 1, the
