BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.117
2025 Page 27 of 33
any assets retained by the employer incident to the liquidation of the
employer’s obligations, and who thereafter continues the acquired business
shall be considered to be a successor to the predecessor from whom the
business was acquired and, if not already an employer before the acquisition,
shall become an employer on the date of the acquisition. The Commissioner
shall transfer the experience-rating record of the predecessor employer to the

the period immediately preceding the date of acquisition if there was only one
predecessor or there were only predecessors with identical rates. If the

year, after which the experience-rating record of the predecessor shall be

organization, trade, or business or substantially all of the assets of any

the acquiring individual or employing unit shall not be treated as a successor.
(3) If a successor, upon acquisition of an employer under subdivision (1)
of this subsection, divides operation of the successor business between two or
more corporate entities, the successor shall designate one of the corporate
entities involved in successor’s business operations as the filing successor for
purposes of quarterly wage reporting and benefit rate assignment. The
designated filing successor shall include all employees involved in carrying on
the successor business in the designated filing successor’s quarterly wage
reporting and shall pay the full successor benefit tax on all business
employees.

ended within that 12-month period is the highest annual ratio within the 10-
