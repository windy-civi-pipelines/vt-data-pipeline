§ 1325. EMPLOYERS’ EXPERIENCE-RATING RECORDS;
DISCLOSURE TO SUCCESSOR ENTITY
* * *
(b)(1) Disclosure of contribution rate to successor entity. Any individual
or employing unit who in any manner succeeds to or acquires the organization,
trade, or business or substantially all of the assets of any employer who has
been operating the business within two weeks prior to the acquisition, except
any assets retained by the employer incident to the liquidation of the
employer’s obligations, and who thereafter continues the acquired business
shall be considered to be a successor to the predecessor from whom the
business was acquired and, if not already an employer before the acquisition,
shall become an employer on the date of the acquisition. The Commissioner
shall transfer the experience-rating record of the predecessor employer to the
successor employer. If the successor was not an employer before the date of
acquisition, the successor’s rate of contribution for the remainder of the rate
year shall be the rate applicable to the predecessor employers with respect to
the period immediately preceding the date of acquisition if there was only one
predecessor or there were only predecessors with identical rates. If the
predecessors’ rates were not identical, the Commissioner shall determine a rate
based on the combined experience of all the predecessor employers. If the
successor was an employer before the date of acquisition, the contribution rate
that was assigned to the successor for the rate year in which the acquisition
occurred will remain assigned to the successor for the remainder of the rate
year, after which the experience-rating record of the predecessor shall be
combined with the experience rating of the successor to form the single
employer experience-rating record of the successor. At any time prior to the
issuance of the certificate required by subsection 1322(b) of this chapter, an
employing unit shall, upon request of a potential successor, disclose to the
potential successor its current experience-rating record.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection,
an individual or employing unit who in any manner succeeds to or acquires the
organization, trade, or business or substantially all of the assets of any
employing unit who was an employer before the date of acquisition and whose
currently assigned contribution rate is higher than that currently assigned to the
acquiring individual or employing unit shall not be treated as a successor.
(3) If a successor, upon acquisition of an employer under subdivision
(1) of this subsection, divides operation of the successor business between two
or more corporate entities, the successor shall designate one of the corporate
entities involved in successor’s business operations as the filing successor for
purposes of quarterly wage reporting and benefit rate assignment. The
designated filing successor shall include all employees involved in carrying on
the successor business in the designated filing successor’s quarterly wage
reporting and shall pay the full successor benefit tax on all business
employees.
* * *
Sec. 18. 21 V.S.A. § 1326 is amended to read:

Section 14:
§ 1326. RATE BASED ON BENEFIT EXPERIENCE
* * *
(d) The Commissioner shall compute a current fund ratio, and a highest
benefit cost rate, as follows:
(1) The current fund ratio shall be determined by dividing the available
balance of the Unemployment Compensation Fund on December 31 of the
preceding calendar year by the total wages paid for employment during that
calendar year as reported by employers by the following March 31.
(2)(A) The highest benefit cost rate shall be determined by dividing the
highest amount of benefit payments made during a consecutive 12-month
period that ended within the 10-year period ending on the preceding December
31, by the total wages paid during the four calendar quarter periods that ended
within that 12-month period is the highest annual ratio within the 10-year
period ending on the preceding December 31 of benefits paid, including the
State’s share of extended benefits, for taxpaying employers divided by total
wages paid in covered employment for taxpaying employers for the same
period.
(B) Notwithstanding any provision of subdivision (A) of this
subdivision (d)(2) to the contrary, when computing the tax rate schedule to
become effective on July 1, 2021 and on each subsequent July 1, the
Commissioner shall calculate the highest benefit cost rate without
consideration of benefit payments made in calendar year 2020.
* * *
Sec. 19. 21 V.S.A. § 1338a is amended to read:

Section 15:
§ 1338a. DISREGARDED EARNINGS
(a) An individual shall be deemed “partially unemployed” in any week of
less than full-time work if the wages earned by the individual with respect to
such week are less than the weekly benefit amount the individual would be
entitled to receive if totally unemployed and eligible. As used in this section,

trade, or business or substantially all of the assets of any employer who has
been operating the business within two weeks prior to the acquisition, except
any assets retained by the employer incident to the liquidation of the
employer’s obligations, and who thereafter continues the acquired business
shall be considered to be a successor to the predecessor from whom the
business was acquired and, if not already an employer before the acquisition,
shall become an employer on the date of the acquisition. The Commissioner
shall transfer the experience-rating record of the predecessor employer to the
successor employer. If the successor was not an employer before the date of
acquisition, the successor’s rate of contribution for the remainder of the rate
year shall be the rate applicable to the predecessor employers with respect to
the period immediately preceding the date of acquisition if there was only one
predecessor or there were only predecessors with identical rates. If the
predecessors’ rates were not identical, the Commissioner shall determine a rate
based on the combined experience of all the predecessor employers. If the
successor was an employer before the date of acquisition, the contribution rate
that was assigned to the successor for the rate year in which the acquisition
occurred will remain assigned to the successor for the remainder of the rate
year, after which the experience-rating record of the predecessor shall be
combined with the experience rating of the successor to form the single
employer experience-rating record of the successor. At any time prior to the

employing unit shall, upon request of a potential successor, disclose to the
potential successor its current experience-rating record.

an individual or employing unit who in any manner succeeds to or acquires the
organization, trade, or business or substantially all of the assets of any
employing unit who was an employer before the date of acquisition and whose
currently assigned contribution rate is higher than that currently assigned to the
acquiring individual or employing unit shall not be treated as a successor.
(3) If a successor, upon acquisition of an employer under subdivision
(1) of this subsection, divides operation of the successor business between two
or more corporate entities, the successor shall designate one of the corporate
entities involved in successor’s business operations as the filing successor for
purposes of quarterly wage reporting and benefit rate assignment. The
designated filing successor shall include all employees involved in carrying on
the successor business in the designated filing successor’s quarterly wage
reporting and shall pay the full successor benefit tax on all business
employees.
* * *
Sec. 18. 21 V.S.A. § 1326 is amended to read:
§ 1326. RATE BASED ON BENEFIT EXPERIENCE
* * *
(d) The Commissioner shall compute a current fund ratio, and a highest
benefit cost rate, as follows:
(1) The current fund ratio shall be determined by dividing the available
balance of the Unemployment Compensation Fund on December 31 of the
preceding calendar year by the total wages paid for employment during that
calendar year as reported by employers by the following March 31.
(2)(A) The highest benefit cost rate shall be determined by dividing the
highest amount of benefit payments made during a consecutive 12-month
period that ended within the 10-year period ending on the preceding December
31, by the total wages paid during the four calendar quarter periods that ended
within that 12-month period is the highest annual ratio within the 10-year
period ending on the preceding December 31 of benefits paid, including the
State’s share of extended benefits, for taxpaying employers divided by total
wages paid in covered employment for taxpaying employers for the same
period.
(B) Notwithstanding any provision of subdivision (A) of this
subdivision (d)(2) to the contrary, when computing the tax rate schedule to

become effective on July 1, 2021 and on each subsequent July 1, the
Commissioner shall calculate the highest benefit cost rate without
consideration of benefit payments made in calendar year 2020.
* * *
Sec. 19. 21 V.S.A. § 1338a is amended to read:
§ 1338a. DISREGARDED EARNINGS
(a) An individual shall be deemed “partially unemployed” in any week of
less than full-time work if the wages earned by the individual with respect to
such week are less than the weekly benefit amount the individual would be
entitled to receive if totally unemployed and eligible. As used in this section,
“wages” in any one week includes only that amount of remuneration rounded
down to the nearest dollar that is in excess of 50 percent of the individual’s
weekly wage.
