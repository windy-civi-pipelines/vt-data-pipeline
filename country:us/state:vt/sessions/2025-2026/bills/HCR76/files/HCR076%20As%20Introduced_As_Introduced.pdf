State of Vermont
House of Representatives
Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 76
Offered by Representatives Houghton of EssexJunction, Black of Essex, and Scheu of Middlebury
House concurrent resolution honoring Robin Lunge for her dedicated public service in Vermont State
government
Whereas, Robin Lunge’s exemplary career across the three branches of Vermont State government has
always epitomized the ideal virtue of public service, a selfless dedication to serving all Vermonters, and
Whereas, a graduate of Brattleboro Union High School, Robin earned a bachelor’s degree from the
University of California at Santa Cruz and a Juris Doctor cum laude at Cornell University Law School, and
Whereas, her first legal position was as a Vermont State trial court clerk, leading to several years of private
law practice, and then she started the first of two terms (11/2003–6/2007) and (11/2008–1/2011) as a
nonpartisan Legislative Counsel staff attorney where she provided legal support to legislators and legislative
committees on matters pertaining to health care and international trade, and
Whereas, in the interlude between her legislative assignments, Robin Lunge was employed as a budget
analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, DC, and
Whereas, upon departing the Legislative Counsel in 2011, Robin Lunge transitioned to a staff attorney role at
the Department of Financial Regulation, but that assignment was short-lived, as Governor Peter Shumlin
appointed her to the challenging task of serving as the Director of State Health Care Reform during the effort to
introduce single-payer health insurance, and
Whereas, in November 2016, Governor Peter Shumlin appointed Robin Lunge to the Green Mountain Care
Board, where her broad scope of health care experience, fine-tuned with a master’s degree in health care
science from Dartmouth College, has brought a singularly independent and informed thinker to the Board, and
Governor Philip Scott extended her tenure, and
Whereas, despite her intensive professional life, Robin Lunge is an enthusiastic mountain hiker who even
installed a climbing wall in her home, and after eight years at the Board, she is embarking on a new adventure
as the Senior Outreach Representative for Health Care in the Burlington and Montpelier offices of U.S. Senator
Welch, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly honors Robin Lunge for her dedicated public service in Vermont State
government, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to Robin Lunge.
