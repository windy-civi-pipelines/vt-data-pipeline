public service in Vermont State government.

Offered by Representatives Houghton of Essex Junction, Black of Essex, and Scheu of
Middlebury
Whereas, Robin Lunge’s exemplary career across the three branches of Vermont State
government has always epitomized the ideal virtue of public service, a selfless dedication
to serving all Vermonters, and
Whereas, a graduate of Brattleboro Union High School, Robin earned a bachelor’s
degree from the University of California at Santa Cruz and a Juris Doctor cum laude at
Cornell University Law School, and
Whereas, her first legal position was as a Vermont State trial court clerk, leading to
several years of private law practice, and then she started the first of two terms (11/2003–
6/2007) and (11/2008–1/2011) as a nonpartisan Legislative Counsel staff attorney where
she provided legal support to legislators and legislative committees on matters pertaining
to health care and international trade, and
Whereas, in the interlude between her legislative assignments, Robin Lunge was
employed as a budget analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in
Washington, DC, and
Whereas, upon departing the Legislative Counsel in 2011, Robin Lunge transitioned to
a staff attorney role at the Department of Financial Regulation, but that assignment was
short-lived, as Governor Peter Shumlin appointed her to the challenging task of serving
as the Director of State Health Care Reform during the effort to introduce single-payer
health insurance, and
Whereas, in November 2016, Governor Peter Shumlin appointed Robin Lunge to the
Green Mountain Care Board, where her broad scope of health care experience, fine-tuned
with a master’s degree in health care science from Dartmouth College, has brought a
singularly independent and informed thinker to the Board, and Governor Philip Scott
extended her tenure, and
Whereas, despite her intensive professional life, Robin Lunge is an enthusiastic
mountain hiker who even installed a climbing wall in her home, and after eight years at
the Board, she is embarking on a new adventure as the Senior Outreach Representative
for Health Care in the Burlington and Montpelier offices of U.S. Senator Welch, now
therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly honors Robin Lunge for her dedicated public service in
Vermont State government, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Robin Lunge.
