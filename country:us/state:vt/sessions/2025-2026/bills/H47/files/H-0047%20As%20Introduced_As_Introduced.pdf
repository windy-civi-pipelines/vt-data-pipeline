1 § 691. TITLE AND PURPOSE
2 This statute shall be known and cited as the Dentist and Dental Hygienist
3 Compact. The purposes of this Compact are to facilitate the interstate practice
4 of dentistry and dental hygiene and improve public access to dentistry and
5 dental hygiene services by providing dentists and dental hygienists licensed in
6 a participating state the ability to practice in participating states in which they
7 are not licensed. The Compact does this by establishing a pathway for a
8 dentists and dental hygienists licensed in a participating state to obtain a
9 compact privilege that authorizes them to practice in another participating state
10 in which they are not licensed. The Compact enables participating states to
11 protect the public health and safety with respect to the practice of such dentists
12 and dental hygienists, through the state’s authority to regulate the practice of
13 dentistry and dental hygiene in the state. The Compact:
14 (1) enables dentists and dental hygienists who qualify for a compact
15 privilege to practice in other participating states without satisfying burdensome
16 and duplicative requirements associated with securing a license to practice in
17 those states;
18 (2) promotes mobility and addresses workforce shortages through each
19 participating state’s acceptance of a compact privilege to practice in that state;
VT LEG #378322 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.47
2025 Page 3 of 45
1 (3) increases public access to qualified, licensed dentists and dental
2 hygienists by creating a responsible, streamlined pathway for licensees to
3 practice in participating states;
4 (4) enhances the ability of participating states to protect the public’s
5 health and safety;
6 (5) does not interfere with licensure requirements established by a
7 participating state;
8 (6) facilitates the sharing of licensure and disciplinary information
9 among participating states;
10 (7) requires dentists and dental hygienists who practice in a participating
11 state pursuant to a compact privilege to practice within the scope of practice
12 authorized in that state;
13 (8) extends the authority of a participating state to regulate the practice
14 of dentistry and dental hygiene within its borders to dentists and dental
15 hygienists who practice in the state through a compact privilege;
16 (9) promotes the cooperation of participating state in regulating the
17 practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within those states; and
18 (10) facilitates the relocation of military members and their spouses who
19 are licensed to practice dentistry or dental hygiene.

1 (b) The licensee must comply with the requirements of subsection (a) of
2 this section to maintain the compact privilege in the remote state. If those
3 requirements are met, the compact privilege will continue as long as the
4 licensee maintains a qualifying license in the state through which the licensee
5 applied for the compact privilege and pays any applicable compact privilege
6 renewal fees.

19 period of time is not eligible for a compact privilege in any other remote state
20 until the specific time for removal of the compact privilege has passed and all
21 encumbrance requirements are satisfied.

12 removed has ended; and

5 authority to impose adverse action against the qualifying license issued by that
6 participating state.
7 (b) A participating state may take adverse action based on the significant
8 investigative information of a remote state, so long as the participating state

10 (c) Nothing in this Compact shall override a participating state’s decision
11 that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse
12 action and that such participation shall remain nonpublic if required by the
13 participating state’s laws. Participating states must require licensees who enter

15 a compact privilege in any other participating state during the term of the
16 alternative program without prior authorization from such other participating
17 state.

2 hygienist holds a license or compact privilege.

5 against a licensee’s compact privilege in the state.
6 (2) In furtherance of its rights and responsibilities under the Compact
7 and the Commission’s rules, issue subpoenas for both hearings and
8 investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the
9 production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a state licensing authority in a
10 participating state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses, or the
11 production of evidence from another participating state, shall be enforced in
12 the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice
13 and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings
14 pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel
15 expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the State
16 where the witnesses or evidence are located.
17 (3) If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the licensee the

11 the licensee had a compact privilege in that remote state.

13 information had the licensee continued to have a compact privilege in that
14 remote state, the remote state shall report the presence of such information to
15 the data system as required by subdivision 698(b)(6) of this title as if it was

8 (a) The Commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to
9 effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and
10 provisions of the Compact. A Commission rule shall be invalid and have no
11 force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is

9 Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any
10 action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such
11 similar matter.
12 (3) The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in
13 any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the Compact or
14 Commission rule and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for

16 render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or
17 promulgated rules.
18 (b) Default, technical assistance, and termination.

6 other participating states.
7 (c) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be
8 terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the
9 Commissioners, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that state

11 cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or

14 all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent
15 to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the

14 may deny a state’s participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the
15 requirements of subsection 700(b) of this title, terminate a participating
16 state’s participation in the Compact, if it determines that a constitutional
17 requirement of a participating state is a material departure from the
18 Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to the
19 constitution of any participating state, the Compact shall remain in full
20 force and effect as to the remaining participating states and in full force
21 and effect as to the participating state affected as to all severable matters.
