4 (a) The General Assembly finds:
5 (1) the State of Vermont is currently experiencing an education funding
6 crisis and one of the central drivers of the increased education fund pressures
7 are the costs associated with treating mental health needs of youth and
8 families;
9 (2) there is a need to fund mental health, treatment, and recovery
10 resources;
11 (3) the consumption of alcoholic beverages is a significant factor for
12 mental health, overdoses, and cancer diagnoses;
13 (4) the responsible consumption of alcoholic beverages requires that the
14 consumer be adequately informed of the beverage and its contents; and
15 (5) according to the 2024 Direct to Consumer Shipping Pilot Program
16 conducted by the Department of Liquor and Lottery, 100% of the direct-to-
17 consumer shipments received under the Program failed to fully comply with
18 Vermont law.

20 (1) all alcoholic beverages sold in the State bear a label that discloses
