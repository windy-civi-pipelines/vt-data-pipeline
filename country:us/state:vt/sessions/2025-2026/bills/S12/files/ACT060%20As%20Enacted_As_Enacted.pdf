No. 60 Page 23 of 38
2025
treated in all respects as if the person had never been arrested, convicted, or
sentenced for the offense and that its effect is to annul the record of arrest,
conviction, and sentence. The court shall provide notice of the sealing to the
respondent, Vermont Crime Information Center (VCIC), the arresting agency,
the Restitution Unit of the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services, and any
other entity that may have a record related to the order to seal. The VCIC shall

Crime Information Center send a copy of any order sealing a criminal history
record to all of the parties and attorneys representing the parties, including to
the prosecuting agency that prosecuted the offense, the Vermont Crime
Information Center (VCIC), the arresting agency, and any other Vermont State
entity identified by the petitioner that may have a record subject to the sealing
order. VCIC shall provide notice of the sealing order to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation’s National Crime Information Center.
(b) Effect.
(1) Except as provided in subdivision subsection (c) of this section,
upon entry of a sealing order, the order shall be legally effective immediately
and the person whose record is sealed shall be treated in all respects as if he or
she the person had never been arrested, convicted, or sentenced for the offense.
(2) In any application for employment, license, or civil right or privilege

required to answer questions about a previous criminal history record only with

(3) The response to an inquiry from any member of the public regarding

pursuant to the exceptions established in this subsection, in a court proceeding
shall, prior to any use of or reference to the record in open court or in a public
filing, notify the court of the party’s intent to do so. The court shall thereafter
determine whether the record may be used prior to its disclosure in the
proceeding. If a party submits a filing that contains a sealed record or a
reference to a sealed record, that filing shall be filed under seal and remain
under seal unless the court permits the use of the sealed record. This shall not
