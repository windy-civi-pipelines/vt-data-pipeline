is intended to provide a general summary of the act and may not be exhaustive. It has been prepared by the
staff of the Office of Legislative Counsel without input from members of the General Assembly. It is not
intended to aid in the interpretation of legislation or to serve as a source of legislative intent.
Act No. 60 (S.12). An act relating to sealing criminal history records
Subjects: Crimes and criminal procedure; criminal history records; sealing
This act amends the chapter adopted by the General Assembly in 2012 that sets forth
the process for a person to petition to have a criminal history record sealed or expunged.
In general, this section moves from a system of sealing and expungement to one of
sealing in most instances, with an expanded list of qualifying crimes, and limited access
to sealed records for certain entities that require such records.
The act also requires automatic expungement of records relating to municipal
violations two years from the date of satisfaction of the judgment and amends the
previously adopted statute requiring expungement of motor vehicle violations to clarify
that the statute applies to motor vehicle violations that occur on and after July 1, 2021.
Finally, the act requires that on or before December 15, 2025, the Vermont Criminal
Justice Council establish a statewide model policy governing the access and use of sealed
criminal history records by Vermont law enforcement agencies. The purpose of the
policy is to ensure consistent statewide application of law and practice regarding the
access and use of sealed criminal history information for criminal justice purposes under
13 V.S.A. chapter 230, balancing the confidentiality of this information with legitimate
criminal justice purposes.
