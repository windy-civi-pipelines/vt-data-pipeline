subsection. Use of a sealed record pursuant to an exception shall not change
the effect of sealing under subsection (b) of this section. Notwithstanding
any other provision of law or a sealing order:
(1) An entity or person that possesses a sealed record, or an attorney for
such entity or person, may continue to use it the record for any litigation or
claim arising out of the same incident or occurrence or involving the same

provisions of 23 V.S.A. § 1210.
(5) A person or a court in possession of an order issued by a court
regarding a matter that was subsequently sealed may file or cite to that
decision in any subsequent proceeding. The party or court filing or citing to
that decision shall ensure that information regarding the identity of the
defendant in the sealed record is redacted.

have access to sealed criminal history records without limitation for the
purpose of responding to queries to the National Instant Criminal Background

pursuant to this chapter and the person’s attorney may access and use the
sealed records.
(9) A law enforcement agency may inspect and receive copies of the
sealed criminal history records of any applicant who applies to the agency to
be a law enforcement officer or a current employee for the purpose of internal
investigation.

criminal history record to carry out research pursuant to 20 V.S.A. § 2056b.
(11) Information and materials gathered by the Department for Children
and Families during a joint investigation with law enforcement, including law
enforcement affidavits and related references to such information and
materials, are not criminal history records as defined in subdivision 7601(2) of
this title and are considered Department records that shall be maintained and
may be utilized as statutorily prescribed by 33 V.S.A. chapter 49 and produced
in response to a court order.

(12) Information and materials gathered by Adult Protective Services
during a joint investigation with law enforcement, including law enforcement
affidavits and other investigative materials, are not criminal history records as
defined in subdivision 7601(2) of this title and are considered records of the
Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent Living, which shall be
maintained and may be utilized as authorized by 33 V.S.A. chapter 69 and
produced in response to a court order.
(d) Process.
(1) The court shall bar viewing of the sealed offense in any accessible
database that it maintains.
(2) Until all charges on a docket have been sealed, the case file shall
remain publicly accessible.
(3) When all charges on a docket have been sealed, the case file shall
become exempt from public access.
(4) When a sealing order is issued by the court, any person or entity,
except the court, that possesses criminal history records and has been provided
notice of the order shall:
(A) bar viewing of the sealed offense in any accessible database that
it maintains or remove information pertaining to the sealed records from any
publicly accessible database that the person or entity maintains; and
(B) clearly label the criminal history record as “SEALED” to ensure
compliance with this section.
(e) Special index.
(1) The court shall keep a special index of cases that have been sealed
together with the sealing order. The index shall list only the name of the

docket number, and the criminal offense that was the subject of the sealing.
(2) The special index and related documents specified in subdivision (1)
of this subsection shall be confidential and shall be physically and
electronically segregated in a manner that ensures confidentiality and that
limits access to authorized persons.
(3) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, inspection of the
sealing order may be permitted only upon petition by the person who is the
subject of the case. The Chief Superior Judge may permit special access to the
index and the documents for research purposes pursuant to the rules for public
access to court records.
(4) The Court Administrator shall establish policies for implementing
this subsection.

(f) Victims Compensation Program. Upon request, the Victim’s Victims

manner as a civil judgment pursuant to subdivision 5362(c)(2) of this title.
§ 7608. VICTIMS
(a) At the time a petition is filed pursuant to this chapter, the respondent
shall give notice of the petition to any victim of the offense who is known to
the respondent. The victim shall have the right to offer the respondent a
statement prior to any stipulation or to offer the court a statement. The
disposition of the petition shall not be unnecessarily delayed pending receipt of
a victim’s statement. The respondent’s inability to locate a victim after a
reasonable effort has been made shall not be a bar to granting a petition.
(b) As used in this section, “reasonable effort” means attempting to contact
the victim by first-class mail at the victim’s last known address and, by
telephone at the victim’s last known phone number, and by email at the
victim’s last known email address.

information that no record exists with respect to such individual.
Notwithstanding this subsection, the record shall not be expunged until
restitution and surcharges have been paid in full, provided that payment of
surcharges shall not be required if the surcharges have been waived by the
court pursuant to section 7282 of this title.
(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person who was 18–
21 years of age at the time the person committed a qualifying crime may file a

petition with the court requesting sealing of the criminal history record related
to the qualifying crime after 30 days have elapsed since the person completed
the terms and conditions for the sentence for the qualifying crime. The court
shall grant the petition and order that the criminal history record be sealed if
the following conditions are met:
(A) Any restitution and surcharges ordered by the court for any
crime of which the person has been convicted has been paid in full, provided
that payment of surcharges shall not be required if the surcharges have been
waived by the court pursuant to section 7282 of this title.
(B) The respondent has failed to show that sealing would be contrary
to the interests of justice.
(2) Order, notice, and effect of sealing shall comply with the provisions
of subsections 7607(a) and (b) of this title.
(b) Exceptions.
(1) A criminal history record that includes both qualifying and
nonqualifying offenses shall not be eligible for expungement sealing pursuant
to this section.
(2) The Vermont Crime Information Center shall retain a special index

subchapter 3 of this title. This index shall only list the name and date of birth
of the subject of the expunged files and records, the offense for which the
subject was convicted, and the docket number of the proceeding that was the
subject of the expungement. The special index shall be confidential and shall
be accessed only by the Director of the Vermont Crime Information Center and
an individual designated for the purpose of providing information to the
Department of Corrections in the preparation of a presentence investigation in
accordance with 28 V.S.A. §§ 204 and 204a. [Repealed.]
(c) Petitions. An individual who was 18–21 years of age at the time the
individual committed a qualifying crime may file a petition with the court
requesting expungement of the criminal history record related to the qualifying
crime after 30 days have elapsed since the individual completed the terms and
conditions for the sentence for the qualifying crime. The court shall grant the
petition and issue an order sealing or expunging the record if it finds that
sealing or expunging the record serves the interests of justice. [Repealed.]
§ 7610. CRIMINALHISTORY RECORD SEALING SPECIALFUND
There is established the Criminal History Record Sealing Special Fund,
which shall be managed in accordance with 32 V.S.A. chapter 7, subchapter 5.
Fees collected pursuant to 32 V.S.A. § 1431(e) for the filing of a petition to
seal a criminal history record of a violation of 23 V.S.A. § 1201(a) shall be
deposited into and credited to this Fund. This Fund shall be available to the

Office of the Court Administrator, the Department of State’s Attorneys and
Sheriffs, the Department of Motor Vehicles, and the Vermont Crime
Information Center to offset the administrative costs of sealing such records.
Balances in the Fund at the end of the fiscal year shall be carried forward and
remain in the Fund.
§ 7611. UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE
A State or municipal employee or contractor or any agent of the court,
including an attorney and an employee or contractor of the attorney, or a law
enforcement officer as defined in 20 V.S.A. § 2351a who knowingly accesses
or discloses sealed criminal history record information without authorization
shall be assessed a civil penalty of not more than $1,000.00. Each
unauthorized disclosure shall constitute a separate civil violation.
Sec. 2. RIGHT TO NOT DISCLOSE EXPUNGED OR SEALED
CRIMINALHISTORY RECORDS
(a) The Secretary of Administration shall notify all State administrative
entities of the obligation to notify persons of the right not to disclose an
expunged record pursuant to 13 V.S.A. § 7606(b)(2) or a sealed record
pursuant to 13 V.S.A. § 7607(b)(2).
(b) The Court Administrator shall notify the Judicial Branch of the

pursuant to 13 V.S.A. § 7606(b)(2) or a sealed record pursuant to 13 V.S.A.
§ 7607(b)(2).
Sec. 3. 13 V.S.A. § 7041 is amended to read:
§ 7041. DEFERRED SENTENCE
(a) Upon an adjudication of guilt and after the filing of a presentence
investigation report, the court may defer sentencing and place the respondent
on probation upon such terms and conditions as it may require if a written
agreement concerning the deferring of sentence is entered into between the
State’s Attorney and the respondent and filed with the clerk of the court.
(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, the court may defer
sentencing and place the respondent on probation without a written agreement
between the State’s Attorney and the respondent if the following conditions
are met:
(1) [Repealed.]
(2) the crime for which the respondent is being sentenced is not a listed
crime as defined in subdivision 5301(7) of this title;

(3) the court orders a presentence investigation in accordance with the
procedures set forth in V.R.C.P. Rule 32, unless the State’s Attorney agrees to
waive the presentence investigation;
(4) the court permits the victim to submit a written or oral statement
concerning the consideration of deferment of sentence;
(5) the court reviews the presentence investigation and the victim’s
impact statement with the parties; and
(6) the court determines that deferring sentence is in the interests of
justice.
(c) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the court may
not defer a sentence for a violation of section 3253a (aggravated sexual assault
of a child), section 2602 (lewd and lascivious conduct with a child unless the
victim and the defendant were within five years of age and the act was
consensual), 3252(c) (sexual assault of a child under 16 unless the victim and
the defendant were within five years of age and the act was consensual),
3252(d) or (e) (sexual assault of a child), 3253(a)(8) (aggravated sexual
assault), or 3253a (aggravated sexual assault of a child) of this title.
(d) Entry of deferment of sentence shall constitute an appealable judgment
for purposes of appeal in accordance with 12 V.S.A. § 2383 and V.R.A.P.
Rule 3. Except as otherwise provided, entry of deferment of sentence shall
constitute imposition of sentence solely for the purpose of sentence review in
accordance with section 7042 of this title. The court may impose sentence at
any time if the respondent violates the conditions of the deferred sentence
during the period of deferment.
(e) Upon violation of the terms of probation or of the deferred sentence
agreement, the court shall impose sentence. Upon fulfillment of the terms of
probation and of the deferred sentence agreement, the court shall strike the
adjudication of guilt and discharge the respondent. Except as provided in
subsection (h) of this section, the record of the criminal proceedings shall be
expunged sealed upon the discharge of the respondent from probation, absent a
finding of good cause by the court. The court shall issue an order to expunge
seal all records and files related to the arrest, citation, investigation, charge,
adjudication of guilt, criminal proceedings, and probation related to the
deferred sentence. Copies of the order shall be sent to each agency,
department, or official named therein. Thereafter, the court, law enforcement
officers, agencies, and departments shall reply to any request for information
that no record exists with respect to such person upon inquiry in the matter.
Notwithstanding this subsection, the record shall not be expunged sealed until
restitution has been paid in full.

(f) A deferred sentence imposed under subsection (a) or (b) of this section
may include a restitution order issued pursuant to section 7043 of this title.
Nonpayment of restitution shall not constitute grounds for imposition of the
underlying sentence.
(g) [Repealed.]
(h) The Vermont Crime Information Center shall retain a special index of
deferred sentences for sex offenses that require registration pursuant to
subchapter 3 of chapter 167 of this title. This index shall only list the name
and date of birth of the subject of the expunged sealed files and records, the
offense for which the subject was convicted, and the docket number of the
proceeding that was the subject of the expungement sealing. The special index
shall be confidential and may be accessed only by the director of the Vermont
Crime Information Center and a designated clerical staffperson for the purpose
of providing information to the Department of Corrections in the preparation
of a presentence investigation in accordance with 28 V.S.A. §§ 204 and 204a.
