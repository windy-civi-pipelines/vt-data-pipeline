Whereas, the general public might narrowly perceive athletic trainers to be individuals
who rush onto a sports field or indoor playing arena when a team member, be it high
school, college, or professional, is injured during the course of a game, and
Whereas, although that is their most visible role, in reality, athletic trainers have a long
history of providing professional quality health care for athletes and other individuals
who are engaged in regular physical activity, and
Whereas, athletic trainers are health care professionals “who specialize in immediate,
acute, and emergency care; examination, assessment, and diagnosis; injury prevention;
risk management; therapeutic intervention; and rehabilitation of injury and illness,” and
Whereas, professional, collegiate, and high school teams; private industries; physician
offices; rehabilitation clinics; and every branch of the U.S. Armed Forces employ athletic
trainers, and they work collaboratively to promote and practice the profession of athletic
training, nationally and within the State of Vermont, and
Whereas, in 1982, these health care professionals, who in 2025 number over 135 in
our State, organized as the Vermont Association of Athletic Trainers (VAAT), which is
dedicated to the education of its members and the enhancement of the profession of
athletic training, for the healthcare benefit of all Vermonters, and
Whereas, VAAT is affiliated with the National Athletic Trainers’ Association
(NATA), which represents and supports more than 45,000 members nationwide, and
NATA has established March as National Athletic Training Month, and
Whereas, the General Assembly has recognized the role of athletic trainers as health
care professionals, and it enacted 1998 Acts and Resolves No. 108 as amended (codified
as 26 V.S.A. chapter 83) providing for the licensure of athletic trainers,
now therefore be it
VT LEG #382295 v.1
