Section 1:
State of Vermont
House of Representatives
Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 133
Offered by Senators Collamore, Weeks, and Williams
House concurrent resolution congratulating West Rutland High School girls’ basketball standout
Peyton Guay and extending to her best wishes for every future success
Whereas, the prolific basketball career of Peyton Guay has always been focused on her team, the
West Rutland High School Golden Horde, and
Whereas, despite her modesty and team focus, were it not for the presence of this outstanding player,
the Golden Horde would never have compiled its amazing four-year consecutive string of Division IV
crowns (2022–2025), and
Whereas, there is no doubt Peyton Guay has written a new page of achievements in the history of
Vermont girls’ high school basketball that will not easily be surpassed, and
Whereas, from the day Peyton Guay first walked onto the hardwood court as a ninth grader, her
coaches and teammates knew she possessed an extraordinary talent for playing the game, as she
demonstrated a keen ability to score from the field and at the foul line, and
Whereas, her unique leadership, combining exemplary talent with a genuine desire to share the ball
with her teammates, contributed to West Rutland’s astounding 86–8 win-loss record over the past four
seasons, and
Whereas, Peyton Guay’s personal statistics, averaging 21.3 points per game and scoring 2,279 points,
the most ever of any Vermont girls’ high school basketball player, are outstanding, and her contribution
of assists is equally impressive, and
Whereas, the conclusion of her time as a Golden Horde player hardly ends her basketball playing
days, as Peyton Guay eagerly anticipates embarking on an exciting new path as a college basketball
player in Florida, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates West Rutland High School girls’ basketball standout
Peyton Guay and extends to her best wishes for every future success, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to Peyton Guay.
