Act No. 30 (H.41). An act relating to abuse of the dead body of a person
Subjects: Crimes; homicide; abuse of a corpse
This act creates a new criminal law for abusing the dead body of a person, codified in
13 V.S.A. § 3761a, and modifies the law governing the unauthorized burial or removal of
a dead body of a person under 18 V.S.A. § 5211 by making it a civil penalty.
Specifically, Sec. 1 of the act creates 13 V.S.A. § 3761a, which prohibits a person
from, knowingly without legal authorization, intentionally burning, mutilating,
disfiguring, dismembering, or destroying the dead body of a person. A person who
violates this law commits a felony offense carrying a penalty of imprisonment of not
more than five years, a fine of not more than $5,000.00, or both.
This act also creates an enhanced felony penalty for those that violate subsection (a) of
13 V.S.A. § 3761a for the purpose of concealing a crime or avoiding apprehension,
prosecution, or conviction of a crime. Additionally, the bill creates an enhanced penalty
for committing sexual conduct upon the dead body of a person. Both of these violations
carry an enhanced felony penalty of a maximum term of imprisonment of not more than
15 years, a fine of not more than $10,000.00, or both.
Sec. 2 of the act amends 18 V.S.A. § 5211, which prohibits the unauthorized burial,
removal, transportation, or entombment of a dead body of a person without a burial-
transit permit. This act modifies the penalty for a violation of this statute by eliminating
the criminal penalties from the law, including the penalties carrying a term of
imprisonment of not more than five years, a fine of not more than $1,000.00, or both, and
replacing it with only a civil penalty of not more than $1,000.00.
