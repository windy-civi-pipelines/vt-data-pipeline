House concurrent resolution honoring the outstanding achievements of the Federal TRIO Programs in
Vermont
Whereas, at seven Vermont colleges, and through the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation, students who
aspire to be their families’ first college graduate but lack the requisite funds can avail themselves of these
federal educational support programs, and
Whereas, in 1964, in the Equal Opportunity Act, Congress established Upward Bound, the original federal
college incentive program for financially disadvantaged students; in the Higher Education Act of 1965,
Congress created Talent Search to assist these students applying for newly established federal financial aid
support; and in 1968, the 1965 law was amended to include the Special Services for Disadvantaged Students
program (now known as Student Support Services), and together these three services became commonly
referred to as the Federal TRIO Programs, and
Whereas, subsequent amendments to the 1965 legislation created the Educational Opportunities Centers and
Veterans Upward Bound (1972); the Ronald E. McNair Post-Baccalaureate Achievement Program (1986); and
in 1990, the Upward Bound program created a new division, Upward Bound Math-Science, and
Whereas, in 1992, Congress officially renamed and combined these programs as the Federal TRIO
Programs, and they continue to be a special gateway for financially disadvantaged students to pursue their
college dream, and
Whereas, students and administrators representing the Federal TRIO Programs in Vermont are visiting the
State House today, Friday, April 25, 2025, and their visit serves as an opportunity to recognize the educational
and societal roles of the Federal TRIO Programs, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly honors the outstanding achievements of the Federal TRIO Programs in Vermont,
and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the Board of Directors
of the Vermont Educational Opportunity Programs.
