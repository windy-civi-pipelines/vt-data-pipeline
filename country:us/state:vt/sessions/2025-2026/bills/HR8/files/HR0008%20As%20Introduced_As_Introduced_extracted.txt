refused to provide any information regarding where he was being taken or
what would happen to him, and

U.S. Representative Balint released, they described this action as “immoral,
inhumane, and illegal,” and
Whereas, Vermont’s three federal legislators also demanded that Mohsen
Mahdawi be afforded “due process under the law and immediately released
from detention,” now therefore be it
Resolved by the House of Representatives:
