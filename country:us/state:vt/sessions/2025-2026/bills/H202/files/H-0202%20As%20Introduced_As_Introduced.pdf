5 Subject: Health; health insurance; prescription drugs; pharmacy benefit
6 managers; pharmacies; hospitals; 340B drug pricing program
7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to prohibit a
8 pharmacy benefit manager from requiring a person covered by a health
9 insurance plan to pay more for a prescription drug than the National Average
10 Drug Acquisition Cost of the drug plus a professional dispensing fee. The bill
11 would require pharmacies to post a notice informing covered persons
12 purchasing prescription drugs that they may ask the pharmacy staff to disclose
13 certain information regarding their price options. The bill would require
14 hospitals to report to the Green Mountain Care Board annually about their
15 participation in the federal 340B drug pricing program. It would also require
16 health insurers to inform covered persons annually of the actual amount their
17 health insurance plan spent on prescription drugs on their behalf during the
18 previous year and would require all entities participating in the 340B program
19 to inform patients annually if their prescription drugs were purchased through
20 the 340B program.
