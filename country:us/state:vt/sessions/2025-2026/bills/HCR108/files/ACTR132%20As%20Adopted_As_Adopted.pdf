Whereas, each autumn, high school boys and girls who are golfing enthusiasts
compete for individual and team State championship laurels, and
Whereas, occasionally, a student golfer may be the sole member of their gender on the
varsity golf team, requiring them to compete on a solo basis, and, undoubtedly, the most
notable of these individual golfers of late is Mount Mansfield Union High School
(MMU) senior Namo Seibert, and
Whereas, beginning as a ninth grader, Namo Seibert has exhibited enormous
confidence and skill, whether carefully putting to complete a hole or maximizing her
drive for more distance on the course, and
Whereas, with the encouraging support of MMU Golf Coach Colin O’Brien, Namo
Seibert has developed her own training routine to ensure she is physically and mentally
prepared for the annual statewide competition, and
Whereas, her presence at the State championship has been truly remarkable, as Namo
Seibert first shocked her competitors with a ninth-grade victory as the girls’ individual
State champion and has now reconfirmed her well-earned status as the premier high
school girls’ golfer in Vermont by winning this title for four consecutive years, now
therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the remarkable four-time State high school
individual girls’ golf champion Namo Seibert, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Namo Seibert.
