Section 1:
State of Vermont
House of Representatives
Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 108
Squirrell of Underhill, Stevens of Waterbury, and Wood of Waterbury
Offered by Senators Chittenden, Lyons, and Ram Hinsdale
House concurrent resolution congratulating the remarkable four-time State
high school individual girls’ golf champion Namo Seibert
Whereas, each autumn, high school boys and girls who are golfing
enthusiasts compete for individual and team State championship laurels, and
Whereas, occasionally, a student golfer may be the sole member of their
gender on the varsity golf team, requiring them to compete on a solo basis,
and, undoubtedly, the most notable of these individual golfers of late is Mount
Mansfield Union High School (MMU) senior Namo Seibert, and
Whereas, beginning as a ninth grader, Namo Seibert has exhibited
enormous confidence and skill, whether carefully putting to complete a hole or
maximizing her drive for more distance on the course, and
Whereas, with the encouraging support of MMU Golf Coach Colin
O’Brien, Namo Seibert has developed her own training routine to ensure she is
physically and mentally prepared for the annual statewide competition, and
Whereas, her presence at the State championship has been truly remarkable,
as Namo Seibert first shocked her competitors with a ninth-grade victory as the
girls’ individual State champion and has now reconfirmed her well-earned
status as the premier high school girls’ golfer in Vermont by winning this title
for four consecutive years, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the remarkable four-time State
high school individual girls’ golf champion Namo Seibert, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this
resolution to Namo Seibert.
