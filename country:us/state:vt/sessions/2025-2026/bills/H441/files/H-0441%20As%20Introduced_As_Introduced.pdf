12 (ii) Incidents that may be harassment shall be considered in the
13 aggregate with varying types of conduct and conduct based on multiple
14 characteristics viewed in totality, rather than in isolation.
15 (iii) Conduct may constitute unlawful harassment, regardless of
16 whether:
17 (I) the complaining student is the person being harassed;
18 (II) the complaining student acquiesced or otherwise submitted
19 to or participated in the conduct;
20 (III) the conduct is also experienced by others outside the
