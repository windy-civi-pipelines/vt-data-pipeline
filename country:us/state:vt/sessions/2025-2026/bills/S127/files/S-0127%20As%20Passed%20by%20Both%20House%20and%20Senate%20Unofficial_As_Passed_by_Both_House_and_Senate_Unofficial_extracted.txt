1 (b) Notwithstanding any provision of any municipal charter, each instance
2 of borrowing by a municipality to finance or otherwise pay for a housing
3 infrastructure project shall occur only after the legal voters of the municipality,

14 information shall include the amount and types of debt and related costs to be
15 incurred, including principal, interest, and fees; terms of the debt; the housing
16 infrastructure project to be financed; the housing development projected to

10 certify to the legislative body in each year thereafter during the life of the
11 housing development site the amount by which the total valuation as

14 relative to the original taxable value.
15 (b) Annually throughout the life of the housing development site, the lister
16 or assessor shall include not more than the original taxable value of the real

19 the housing development site is situated, but the treasurer shall extend all rates
20 so determined against the entire assessed valuation of real property for that
21 year.

4 (d) Annually throughout the life of the housing development site, the
5 municipality shall hold apart, rather than remit to the taxing districts, that
6 proportion of all taxes paid that year on the real property within the housing
7 development site that the excess valuation bears to the total assessed valuation.
8 The amount held apart each year is the “tax increment” for that year. The tax
9 increment shall only be used for financing and related costs.
10 (e) Not more than the percentages established pursuant to section 1910c of
11 this subchapter of the municipal and State education tax increments received
12 with respect to the housing development site and committed for the payment
13 for financing for improvements and related costs shall be segregated by the
14 municipality in a special tax increment financing account and in its official
15 books and records until all capital indebtedness incurred for the housing
16 infrastructure project has been fully paid. The final payment shall be reported
17 to the treasurer, who shall thereafter include the entire assessed valuation of the
18 housing development site in the assessed valuations upon which the municipal
19 and other tax rates are computed and extended, and thereafter no taxes from
20 the housing development site shall be deposited in the special tax increment
21 financing account.

4 of this title or under a municipal charter shall not be considered property taxes
5 for the purpose of this section if the proceeds are used exclusively for
6 operating expenses related to properties within the housing development site
7 and not for improvements within the housing development site.
8 § 1910c. USE OF TAX INCREMENT; RETENTION PERIOD
9 (a) Uses of tax increments. A municipality may apply tax increments
10 retained pursuant to this subchapter to debt incurred within the period
11 permitted under section 1910a of this subchapter, to related costs, and to the
12 direct payment of the cost of a housing infrastructure project. A municipality
13 may provide tax increment to a sponsor only upon receipt of an invoice for
14 payment of the financing, and the sponsor shall confirm to the municipality
15 once the tax increment has been applied to the financing. Any direct payment
16 shall be subject to the same public vote provisions of section 1910a of this
17 subchapter as apply to debt.

VT LEG #384103 v.1

8 Department of Taxes and the Vermont Economic Progress Council of the
9 beginning of the retention period of the education property tax increment.
10 (c) Municipal property tax increment. Not less than 85 percent of the
11 municipal property tax increment may be retained, beginning the first year in
12 which debt is incurred for the housing infrastructure project.
13 (d) Excess tax increment.
14 (1) Of the municipal and education property tax increments received in
15 any tax year that exceed the amounts committed for the payment of the
16 financing and related costs for a housing infrastructure project, equal portions
17 of each increment may be retained for the following purposes:
18 (A) to prepay principal and interest on the financing;
19 (B) to place in a special tax increment financing account required
20 pursuant to subsection 1910b(e) of this subchapter and use for future financing
21 payments; or
VT LEG #384103 v.1

5 town, or village budget in the proportion that each budget bears to the
6 combined total of the budgets unless otherwise negotiated by the city, town, or
7 village.
8 (e) Adjustment of percentage. During the 10th year following the creation
9 of a housing development site, the municipality shall submit an updated tax
10 increment financing plan to the Vermont Economic Progress Council that shall
11 include adjustments and updates of appropriate data and information sufficient
12 for the Vermont Economic Progress Council to determine, based on tax
13 increment financing debt actually incurred and the history of increment
14 generated during the first 10 years, whether the percentages approved under
15 this section should be continued or adjusted to a lower percentage to be
16 retained for the remaining duration of the retention period and still provide
17 sufficient municipal and education increment to service the remaining debt.

5 municipality shall hold apart, rather than remit to the taxing districts, that
6 proportion of all taxes paid that year on the real property within the housing
7 development site that the excess valuation bears to the total assessed valuation.
8 The amount held apart each year is the “tax increment” for that year. The tax

9 of a housing development site, the municipality shall submit an updated tax
10 increment financing plan to the Vermont Economic Progress Council that shall
11 include adjustments and updates of appropriate data and information sufficient
12 for the Vermont Economic Progress Council to determine, based on tax
13 increment financing debt actually incurred and the history of increment
14 generated during the first 10 years, whether the percentages approved under
15 this section should be continued or adjusted to a lower percentage to be
16 retained for the remaining duration of the retention period and still provide
17 sufficient municipal and education increment to service the remaining debt.
