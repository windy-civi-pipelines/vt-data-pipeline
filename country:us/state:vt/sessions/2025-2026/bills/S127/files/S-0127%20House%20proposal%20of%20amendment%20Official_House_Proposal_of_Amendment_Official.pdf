(a) Application. A municipality, upon approval of its legislative body, may
apply to the Vermont Economic Progress Council to use tax increment
financing for a housing infrastructure project.
(b) But-for test. The Vermont Economic Progress Council shall review
each application to determine whether the infrastructure improvements
proposed to serve the housing development site and the proposed housing
development would not have occurred as proposed in the application or would
have occurred in a significantly different and less desirable manner than as
proposed in the application but for the proposed utilization of the incremental
taxrevenues. The review shall take into account:

(1) the amount of additional time, if any, needed to complete the
proposed housing development and the amount of additional cost that might be
incurred if the project were to proceed without education property tax
increment financing;
(2) how the proposed housing development components and size would
differ, if at all, including, if applicable to the housing development, in the
number of units of mixed-income housing, without education property tax
increment financing; and
(3)(A) the amount of additional revenue expected to be generated as a
result of the proposed housing development;
(B) the percentage of that revenue that shall be paid to the Education
Fund;
(C) the percentage that shall be paid to the municipality; and
(D) the percentage of the revenue paid to the municipality that shall
be used to pay financing incurred for the infrastructure improvements.

site pursuant to section 1908 of this subchapter;
(2) executed a housing infrastructure agreement for the housing
infrastructure project that adheres to the standards of section 1909 of this
subchapter with a developer and, if the municipality is not financing the
housing infrastructure project itself, a sponsor; and
(3) approved or pledged to use incremental municipal tax revenues for
the housing infrastructure project in the proportion provided for municipal tax
revenues in section 1910c of this subchapter.
(d) Project criterion. The Vermont Economic Progress Council shall
review a municipality’s housing infrastructure project application to determine
whether at least 65 percent of the floor area of the projected housing
development is dedicated to housing.
(e) Mixed-income criterion. The Vermont Economic Progress Council
shall review a municipality’s housing infrastructure project application to
determine whether the projected housing development is a mixed-income
housing development for purposes of the increased education property tax
increment retention percentage under section 1910c of this subchapter.
(f) Tax increment financing plan. The Vermont Economic Progress
Council shall approve a municipality’s tax increment financing plan prior to a

sponsor’s incurrence of debt for the housing infrastructure project, including,
if the sponsor is a municipality, prior to a public vote to pledge the credit of
the municipality under section 1910a of this subchapter. The tax increment
financing plan shall include:

plan; and
(3) that are submitted on or before December 31, 2031.
(h) Limit. The Vermont Economic Progress Council shall not annually
approve more than $40,000,000.00 in aggregate lifetime education property
tax increment retention. The Vermont Economic Progress Council may
increase this limit by not more than $5,000,000.00 upon application by the
Governor to, and approval of, the Joint Fiscal Committee. In evaluating the
Governor’s request, the Joint Fiscal Committee shall consider the economic
and fiscal condition of the State, including recent revenue forecasts and budget
projections. The Vermont Economic Progress Council shall provide the Joint
Fiscal Committee with testimony, documentation, housing infrastructure
project application data, and any other information the Committee requests to
demonstrate that increasing the cap will create an opportunity for the creation
of additional housing to meet the needs of a municipality or municipalities and
the State.

§ 1910a. INDEBTEDNESS
(a) A municipality approved for tax increment financing under section
1910 of this subchapter may incur indebtedness against revenues of the

following the creation of the housing development site. The Vermont
Economic Progress Council may extend this debt incursion period by up to
three years.
(b) Notwithstanding any provision of any municipal charter, each instance
of borrowing by a municipality to finance or otherwise pay for a housing
infrastructure project shall occur only after the legal voters of the municipality,
by a majority vote of all voters present and voting on the question at a special
or annual municipal meeting duly warned for the purpose, authorize the
legislative body to pledge the credit of the municipality, borrow, or otherwise
secure the debt for the specific purposes so warned.
(c) Any indebtedness incurred under this section may be retired over any
period authorized by the legislative body of the municipality.
(d) The housing development site shall continue until the date and hour the
indebtedness is retired or, if no debt is incurred, the debt incursion period ends.
(e) A municipal legislative body shall provide information to the public
prior to the public vote required under subsection (b) of this section. This
information shall include the amount and types of debt and related costs to be
incurred, including principal, interest, and fees; terms of the debt; the housing
infrastructure project to be financed; the housing development projected to
occur because of the housing infrastructure project; and notice to the voters
that if the tax increment received by the municipality from any property tax
source is insufficient to pay the principal and interest on the debt in any year,
the municipality shall remain liable for the full payment of the principal and
interest for the term of the indebtedness. If interfund loans within the
municipality are used, the information must also include documentation of the
terms and conditions of the loan.
(f) If interfund loans within the municipality are used as the method of
financing, no interest shall be charged.
(g) The use of a bond anticipation note shall not be considered a first
incurrence of debt pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.
§ 1910b. ORIGINALTAXABLE VALUE; TAX INCREMENT
(a) As of the date the housing development site is created, the lister or
assessor for the municipality shall certify the original taxable value and shall
certify to the legislative body in each year thereafter during the life of the
housing development site the amount by which the total valuation as
determined in accordance with 32 V.S.A. chapter 129 of all taxable real

property within the housing development site has increased or decreased
relative to the original taxable value.
(b) Annually throughout the life of the housing development site, the lister
or assessor shall include not more than the original taxable value of the real
property in the assessed valuation upon which the treasurer computes the rates
of all taxes levied by the municipality and every other taxing district in which
the housing development site is situated, but the treasurer shall extend all rates
so determined against the entire assessed valuation of real property for that
year.
(c) Annually throughout the life of the housing development site, a
municipality shall remit not less than the aggregate education property tax due
on the original taxable value to the Education Fund.
(d) Annually throughout the life of the housing development site, the
municipality shall hold apart, rather than remit to the taxing districts, that
proportion of all taxes paid that year on the real property within the housing
development site that the excess valuation bears to the total assessed valuation.
The amount held apart each year is the “tax increment” for that year. The tax
increment shall only be used for financing and related costs.
(e) Not more than the percentages established pursuant to section 1910c of
this subchapter of the municipal and State education tax increments received
with respect to the housing development site and committed for the payment
for financing for improvements and related costs shall be segregated by the
municipality in a special tax increment financing account and in its official
books and records until all capital indebtedness incurred for the housing
infrastructure project has been fully paid. The final payment shall be reported
to the treasurer, who shall thereafter include the entire assessed valuation of
the housing development site in the assessed valuations upon which the
municipal and other tax rates are computed and extended, and thereafter no
taxes from the housing development site shall be deposited in the special tax
increment financing account.
(f) Notwithstanding any charter provision or other provision, all property
taxes assessed within a housing development site shall be subject to the
provisions of this section. Special assessments levied under chapter 76A or 87
of this title or under a municipal charter shall not be considered property taxes
for the purpose of this section if the proceeds are used exclusively for
operating expenses related to properties within the housing development site
and not for improvements within the housing development site.
§ 1910c. USE OF TAX INCREMENT; RETENTION PERIOD
(a) Uses of tax increments. A municipality may apply tax increments
retained pursuant to this subchapter to debt incurred within the period

permitted under section 1910a of this subchapter, to related costs, and to the
direct payment of the cost of a housing infrastructure project. A municipality
may provide tax increment to a sponsor only upon receipt of an invoice for
payment of the financing, and the sponsor shall confirm to the municipality
once the tax increment has been applied to the financing. Any direct payment
shall be subject to the same public vote provisions of section 1910a of this
subchapter as apply to debt.
(b) Education property taxincrement.
(1) For a housing infrastructure project that does not satisfy the mixed-
income criterion of section 1910 of this subchapter, up to 60 percent of the
education property taxincrement may be retained for up to 20 years, beginning
the first year in which debt is incurred for the housing infrastructure project.
(2) For a housing infrastructure project that satisfies the mixed-income
criterion of section 1910 of this subchapter, up to 80 percent of the education
property tax increment may be retained for up to 20 years, beginning the first
year in which debt is incurred for the housing infrastructure project.
(3) Upon incurring the first debt, a municipality shall notify the
Department of Taxes and the Vermont Economic Progress Council of the
beginning of the retention period of the education property taxincrement.
(c) Municipal property tax increment. Not less than 85 percent of the
municipal property tax increment may be retained, beginning the first year in
which debt is incurred for the housing infrastructure project.
(d) Excess taxincrement.
(1) Of the municipal and education property tax increments received in
any tax year that exceed the amounts committed for the payment of the
financing and related costs for a housing infrastructure project, equal portions
of each increment may be retained for the following purposes:
(A) to prepay principal and interest on the financing;
(B) to place in a special tax increment financing account required
pursuant to subsection 1910b(e) of this subchapter and use for future financing
payments; or
(C) to use for defeasance of the financing.
(2) Any remaining portion of the excess education property tax
increment shall be distributed to the Education Fund. Any remaining portion
of the excess municipal property tax increment shall be distributed to the city,
town, or village budget in the proportion that each budget bears to the
combined total of the budgets unless otherwise negotiated by the city, town, or
village.

(e) Adjustment of percentage. During the fifth year following the creation
of a housing development site, the municipality shall submit an updated tax
increment financing plan to the Vermont Economic Progress Council that shall
include adjustments and updates of appropriate data and information sufficient
for the Vermont Economic Progress Council to determine, based on tax
increment financing debt actually incurred and the history of increment
generated during the first five years, whether the percentages approved under
this section should be continued or adjusted to a lower percentage to be
retained for the remaining duration of the retention period and still provide
sufficient municipal and education increment to service the remaining debt.
§ 1910d. INFORMATION REPORTING
(a) A municipality with an active housing infrastructure project shall:
(1) develop a system, segregated for the housing infrastructure project,
to identify, collect, and maintain all data and information necessary to fulfill
the reporting requirements of this section;

the special tax increment financing account required by section 1910b of this
subchapter is subject to the annual audit prescribed in section 1681 or 1690 of
this title and submit a copy to the Vermont Economic Progress Council. If an
account is subject only to the audit under section 1681 of this title, the Council
shall ensure a process is in place to subject the account to an independent
audit. Procedures for the audit must include verification of the original taxable
value and annual and total municipal and education property tax increments
generated, expenditures for financing and related costs, and current balance.

§ 1910f. RULEMAKING
The Vermont Economic Progress Council may adopt rules that are
reasonably necessary to implement this subchapter. The Council shall
specifically adopt rules to:
(1) govern the prioritization of applications submitted for approval of
tax increment financing under this subchapter that take into consideration the
purpose of section 1907 of this subchapter, vacancy or dilapidation, regional
equity and verifiable housing shortages, and labor sheds;
(2) determine the appropriate floor area measure for purposes of the
project criterion under subsection 1910(e) of this subchapter; and
(3) supplement the but-for test under subsection 1910(c) of this
subchapter giving due consideration to any rulemaking undertaken to
supplement the but-for test under 32 V.S.A. § 5404a(h)(1)(A).
§ 1910g. GUIDANCE
(a) The Secretary of Commerce and Community Development, after
reasonable notice to a municipality and an opportunity for a hearing, may issue
decisions to a municipality on questions and inquiries concerning the
administration of housing infrastructure projects, statutes, rules,
noncompliance with this subchapter, and any instances of noncompliance
identified in audit reports conducted pursuant to section 1910e of this
subchapter.
(b) The Vermont Economic Progress Council shall prepare
recommendations for the Secretary of Commerce and Community
Development prior to any decision issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this
section. The Council may prepare recommendations in consultation with the
Commissioner of Taxes, the Attorney General, and the State Treasurer. In
preparing recommendations, the Council shall provide a municipality with a
reasonable opportunity to submit written information in support of its position.
(c) The Secretary of Commerce and Community Development shall review
the recommendations of the Council and issue a final written decision on each
matter within 60 days following receipt of the recommendations. The
Secretary may permit an appeal to be taken by any party to a Superior Court
for determination of questions of law in the same manner as the Supreme
Court may by rule provide for appeals before final judgment from a Superior
Court before issuing a final decision.
