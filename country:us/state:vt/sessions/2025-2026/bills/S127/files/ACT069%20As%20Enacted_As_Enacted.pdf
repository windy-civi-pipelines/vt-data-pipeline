apply to the Vermont Economic Progress Council to use tax increment
financing for a housing infrastructure project.
(b) But-for test. The Vermont Economic Progress Council shall review
each application other than those for which the housing development is an
affordable housing development to determine whether the infrastructure
improvements proposed to serve the housing development site and the
proposed housing development would not have occurred as proposed in the
application or would have occurred in a significantly different and less
desirable manner than as proposed in the application but for the proposed
utilization of the incremental tax revenues.
(c) Process requirements. The Vermont Economic Progress Council shall
review a municipality’s housing infrastructure project application to determine
whether the municipality has:
(1) created a housing infrastructure project and housing development
site pursuant to section 1908 of this subchapter;
(2) executed a housing infrastructure agreement for the housing
infrastructure project that adheres to the standards of section 1909 of this

development is dedicated to housing; or
(2) the projected housing development meaningfully addresses the
purpose of section 1907 of this subchapter.
(e) Affordability criterion. The Vermont Economic Progress Council shall
review a municipality’s housing infrastructure project application to determine
whether the projected housing development is an affordable housing

(f) Tax increment financing plan. The Vermont Economic Progress
Council shall approve a municipality’s tax increment financing plan prior to a
sponsor’s incurrence of debt for the housing infrastructure project, including, if

§ 1910a. INDEBTEDNESS
(a) A municipality approved for tax increment financing under section
1910 of this subchapter may incur indebtedness against revenues of the
housing development site at any time during a period of up to five years
following the creation of the housing development site. The Vermont
Economic Progress Council may extend this debt incursion period by up to
three years.
(b) Notwithstanding any provision of any municipal charter, each instance
of borrowing by a municipality to finance or otherwise pay for a housing
infrastructure project shall occur only after the legal voters of the municipality,
by a majority vote of all voters present and voting on the question at a special

information shall include the amount and types of debt and related costs to be
incurred, including principal, interest, and fees; terms of the debt; the housing
infrastructure project to be financed; the housing development projected to

interest for the term of the indebtedness. If interfund loans within the
municipality are used, the information must also include documentation of the
terms and conditions of the loan.
(f) If interfund loans within the municipality are used as the method of
financing, no interest shall be charged.
(g) The use of a bond anticipation note shall not be considered a first
incurrence of debt pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.
§ 1910b. ORIGINAL TAXABLE VALUE; TAX INCREMENT
(a) As of the date the housing development site is created, the lister or
assessor for the municipality shall certify the original taxable value and shall
certify to the legislative body in each year thereafter during the life of the
housing development site the amount by which the total valuation as
determined in accordance with 32 V.S.A. chapter 129 of all taxable real
VT LEG #384285 v.1

No. 69 Page 44 of 60
2025
property within the housing development site has increased or decreased
relative to the original taxable value.
(b) Annually throughout the life of the housing development site, the lister
or assessor shall include not more than the original taxable value of the real
property in the assessed valuation upon which the treasurer computes the rates
of all taxes levied by the municipality and every other taxing district in which
the housing development site is situated, but the treasurer shall extend all rates
so determined against the entire assessed valuation of real property for that
year.
(c) Annually throughout the life of the housing development site, a
municipality shall remit not less than the aggregate education property tax due
on the original taxable value to the Education Fund.
(d) Annually throughout the life of the housing development site, the
municipality shall hold apart, rather than remit to the taxing districts, that
proportion of all taxes paid that year on the real property within the housing
development site that the excess valuation bears to the total assessed valuation.
The amount held apart each year is the “tax increment” for that year. The tax
increment shall only be used for financing and related costs.
(e) Not more than the percentages established pursuant to section 1910c of
this subchapter of the municipal and State education tax increments received
with respect to the housing development site and committed for the payment
for financing for improvements and related costs shall be segregated by the
VT LEG #384285 v.1

No. 69 Page 45 of 60
2025
municipality in a special tax increment financing account and in its official
books and records until all capital indebtedness incurred for the housing
infrastructure project has been fully paid. The final payment shall be reported
to the treasurer, who shall thereafter include the entire assessed valuation of the
housing development site in the assessed valuations upon which the municipal
and other tax rates are computed and extended, and thereafter no taxes from
the housing development site shall be deposited in the special tax increment
financing account.
(f) Notwithstanding any charter provision or other provision, all property
taxes assessed within a housing development site shall be subject to the
provisions of this section. Special assessments levied under chapter 76A or 87
of this title or under a municipal charter shall not be considered property taxes
for the purpose of this section if the proceeds are used exclusively for
operating expenses related to properties within the housing development site
and not for improvements within the housing development site.
§ 1910c. USE OF TAX INCREMENT; RETENTION PERIOD
(a) Uses of tax increments. A municipality may apply tax increments
retained pursuant to this subchapter to debt incurred within the period
permitted under section 1910a of this subchapter, to related costs, and to the
direct payment of the cost of a housing infrastructure project. A municipality
may provide tax increment to a sponsor only upon receipt of an invoice for
payment of the financing, and the sponsor shall confirm to the municipality
VT LEG #384285 v.1

No. 69 Page 46 of 60

once the tax increment has been applied to the financing. Any direct payment
shall be subject to the same public vote provisions of section 1910a of this
subchapter as apply to debt.
(b) Education property tax increment.
(1) For a housing infrastructure project that does not satisfy the
affordability criterion of section 1910 of this subchapter, up to 75 percent of
the education property tax increment may be retained for up to 20 years,
beginning the first year in which debt is incurred for the housing infrastructure
project.
(2) For a housing infrastructure project that satisfies the affordability
criterion of section 1910 of this subchapter, up to 85 percent of the education
property tax increment may be retained for up to 20 years, beginning the first
year in which debt is incurred for the housing infrastructure project.
(3) Upon incurring the first debt, a municipality shall notify the
Department of Taxes and the Vermont Economic Progress Council of the
beginning of the retention period of the education property tax increment.
(c) Municipal property tax increment. Not less than 85 percent of the
municipal property tax increment may be retained, beginning the first year in
which debt is incurred for the housing infrastructure project.
(d) Excess tax increment.
(1) Of the municipal and education property tax increments received in
any tax year that exceed the amounts committed for the payment of the
VT LEG #384285 v.1

No. 69 Page 47 of 60
2025
financing and related costs for a housing infrastructure project, equal portions
of each increment may be retained for the following purposes:
(A) to prepay principal and interest on the financing;
(B) to place in a special tax increment financing account required
pursuant to subsection 1910b(e) of this subchapter and use for future financing
payments; or
(C) to use for defeasance of the financing.
(2) Any remaining portion of the excess education property tax
increment shall be distributed to the Education Fund. Any remaining portion
of the excess municipal property tax increment shall be distributed to the city,
town, or village budget in the proportion that each budget bears to the
combined total of the budgets unless otherwise negotiated by the city, town, or
village.
(e) Adjustment of percentage. During the 10th year following the creation
of a housing development site, the municipality shall submit an updated tax
increment financing plan to the Vermont Economic Progress Council that shall
include adjustments and updates of appropriate data and information sufficient
for the Vermont Economic Progress Council to determine, based on tax
increment financing debt actually incurred and the history of increment
generated during the first 10 years, whether the percentages approved under
this section should be continued or adjusted to a lower percentage to be
VT LEG #384285 v.1

retained for the remaining duration of the retention period and still provide
sufficient municipal and education increment to service the remaining debt.
