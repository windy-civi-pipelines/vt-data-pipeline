1 (b) But-for test. The Vermont Economic Progress Council shall review
2 each application to determine whether the infrastructure improvements
3 proposed to serve the housing development site and the proposed housing
4 development would not have occurred as proposed in the application or would
5 have occurred in a significantly different and less desirable manner than as
6 proposed in the application but for the proposed utilization of the incremental
7 tax revenues. The review shall take into account:
8 (1) the amount of additional time, if any, needed to complete the
9 proposed housing development and the amount of additional cost that might be
10 incurred if the project were to proceed without education property tax
11 increment financing;
12 (2) how the proposed housing development components and size would
13 differ, if at all, including, if applicable to the housing development, in the

17 result of the proposed housing development;
18 (B) the percentage of that revenue that shall be paid to the Education
19 Fund;

3 (c) Process requirements. The Vermont Economic Progress Council shall
4 review a municipality’s housing infrastructure project application to determine
5 whether the municipality has:
6 (1) created a housing infrastructure project and housing development
7 site pursuant to section 1908 of this subchapter;
8 (2) executed a housing infrastructure agreement for the housing
9 infrastructure project that adheres to the standards of section 1909 of this
10 subchapter with a developer and, if the municipality is not financing the
11 housing infrastructure project itself, a sponsor; and
12 (3) approved or pledged to use incremental municipal tax revenues for
13 the housing infrastructure project in the proportion provided for municipal tax
14 revenues in section 1910c of this subchapter.
15 (d) Project criterion. The Vermont Economic Progress Council shall
16 review a municipality’s housing infrastructure project application to determine
17 whether at least 65 percent of the floor area of the projected housing
18 development is dedicated to housing.
19 (e) Mixed-income criterion. The Vermont Economic Progress Council
20 shall review a municipality’s housing infrastructure project application to
21 determine whether the projected housing development is a mixed-income
VT LEG #383889 v.1

2025 Page 51 of 72
1 housing development for purposes of the increased education property tax
2 increment retention percentage under section 1910c of this subchapter.
3 (f) Tax increment financing plan. The Vermont Economic Progress

10 (2) estimates of assessed values within the housing development site;
11 (3) the portion of those assessed values to be applied to the housing
12 infrastructure project;
13 (4) the resulting tax increments in each year of the financial plan and the
14 lifetime education property tax increment retention;
15 (5) the amount of bonded indebtedness or other financing to be incurred;
16 (6) other sources of financing and anticipated revenues; and
17 (7) the duration of the financial plan.
18 (g) Approval. The Vermont Economic Progress Council shall approve or

10 and approval of, the Joint Fiscal Committee. In evaluating the Governor’s
11 request, the Joint Fiscal Committee shall consider the economic and fiscal
12 condition of the State, including recent revenue forecasts and budget
13 projections. The Vermont Economic Progress Council shall provide the Joint
14 Fiscal Committee with testimony, documentation, housing infrastructure
15 project application data, and any other information the Committee requests to
16 demonstrate that increasing the cap will create an opportunity for the creation
17 of additional housing to meet the needs of a municipality or municipalities and
18 the State.

HOUSE PROPOSAL OF AMENDMENT S.127
2025 Page 53 of 72

4 three years.
5 (b) Notwithstanding any provision of any municipal charter, each instance
6 of borrowing by a municipality to finance or otherwise pay for a housing
7 infrastructure project shall occur only after the legal voters of the municipality,
8 by a majority vote of all voters present and voting on the question at a special
9 or annual municipal meeting duly warned for the purpose, authorize the
10 legislative body to pledge the credit of the municipality, borrow, or otherwise
11 secure the debt for the specific purposes so warned.
12 (c) Any indebtedness incurred under this section may be retired over any
13 period authorized by the legislative body of the municipality.

HOUSE PROPOSAL OF AMENDMENT S.127
2025 Page 54 of 72
1 that if the tax increment received by the municipality from any property tax
2 source is insufficient to pay the principal and interest on the debt in any year,
3 the municipality shall remain liable for the full payment of the principal and
4 interest for the term of the indebtedness. If interfund loans within the
5 municipality are used, the information must also include documentation of the
6 terms and conditions of the loan.
7 (f) If interfund loans within the municipality are used as the method of
8 financing, no interest shall be charged.
9 (g) The use of a bond anticipation note shall not be considered a first
10 incurrence of debt pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.
11 § 1910b. ORIGINAL TAXABLE VALUE; TAX INCREMENT

13 assessor for the municipality shall certify the original taxable value and shall
14 certify to the legislative body in each year thereafter during the life of the
15 housing development site the amount by which the total valuation as
16 determined in accordance with 32 V.S.A. chapter 129 of all taxable real
17 property within the housing development site has increased or decreased
18 relative to the original taxable value.
19 (b) Annually throughout the life of the housing development site, the lister
20 or assessor shall include not more than the original taxable value of the real
21 property in the assessed valuation upon which the treasurer computes the rates
VT LEG #383889 v.1
HOUSE PROPOSAL OF AMENDMENT S.127
2025 Page 55 of 72
1 of all taxes levied by the municipality and every other taxing district in which
2 the housing development site is situated, but the treasurer shall extend all rates
3 so determined against the entire assessed valuation of real property for that
4 year.
5 (c) Annually throughout the life of the housing development site, a
6 municipality shall remit not less than the aggregate education property tax due
7 on the original taxable value to the Education Fund.
8 (d) Annually throughout the life of the housing development site, the
9 municipality shall hold apart, rather than remit to the taxing districts, that
10 proportion of all taxes paid that year on the real property within the housing
11 development site that the excess valuation bears to the total assessed valuation.
12 The amount held apart each year is the “tax increment” for that year. The tax
13 increment shall only be used for financing and related costs.
14 (e) Not more than the percentages established pursuant to section 1910c of
15 this subchapter of the municipal and State education tax increments received
16 with respect to the housing development site and committed for the payment
17 for financing for improvements and related costs shall be segregated by the
18 municipality in a special tax increment financing account and in its official
19 books and records until all capital indebtedness incurred for the housing
20 infrastructure project has been fully paid. The final payment shall be reported
21 to the treasurer, who shall thereafter include the entire assessed valuation of the
VT LEG #383889 v.1
HOUSE PROPOSAL OF AMENDMENT S.127
2025 Page 56 of 72
1 housing development site in the assessed valuations upon which the municipal
2 and other tax rates are computed and extended, and thereafter no taxes from
3 the housing development site shall be deposited in the special tax increment
4 financing account.
5 (f) Notwithstanding any charter provision or other provision, all property
6 taxes assessed within a housing development site shall be subject to the
7 provisions of this section. Special assessments levied under chapter 76A or 87
8 of this title or under a municipal charter shall not be considered property taxes
9 for the purpose of this section if the proceeds are used exclusively for
10 operating expenses related to properties within the housing development site
11 and not for improvements within the housing development site.
12 § 1910c. USE OF TAX INCREMENT; RETENTION PERIOD
13 (a) Uses of tax increments. A municipality may apply tax increments
14 retained pursuant to this subchapter to debt incurred within the period
15 permitted under section 1910a of this subchapter, to related costs, and to the
16 direct payment of the cost of a housing infrastructure project. A municipality
17 may provide tax increment to a sponsor only upon receipt of an invoice for
18 payment of the financing, and the sponsor shall confirm to the municipality
19 once the tax increment has been applied to the financing. Any direct payment
20 shall be subject to the same public vote provisions of section 1910a of this
21 subchapter as apply to debt.

4 education property tax increment may be retained for up to 20 years, beginning
5 the first year in which debt is incurred for the housing infrastructure project.

8 of the excess municipal property tax increment shall be distributed to the city,
9 town, or village budget in the proportion that each budget bears to the
10 combined total of the budgets unless otherwise negotiated by the city, town, or
11 village.
12 (e) Adjustment of percentage. During the fifth year following the creation
13 of a housing development site, the municipality shall submit an updated tax
14 increment financing plan to the Vermont Economic Progress Council that shall
15 include adjustments and updates of appropriate data and information sufficient
16 for the Vermont Economic Progress Council to determine, based on tax
17 increment financing debt actually incurred and the history of increment
18 generated during the first five years, whether the percentages approved under
19 this section should be continued or adjusted to a lower percentage to be
20 retained for the remaining duration of the retention period and still provide
21 sufficient municipal and education increment to service the remaining debt.

10 proportion of all taxes paid that year on the real property within the housing
11 development site that the excess valuation bears to the total assessed valuation.
12 The amount held apart each year is the “tax increment” for that year. The tax
13 increment shall only be used for financing and related costs.
14 (e) Not more than the percentages established pursuant to section 1910c of

8 of this title or under a municipal charter shall not be considered property taxes
9 for the purpose of this section if the proceeds are used exclusively for
10 operating expenses related to properties within the housing development site
11 and not for improvements within the housing development site.
12 § 1910c. USE OF TAX INCREMENT; RETENTION PERIOD
13 (a) Uses of tax increments. A municipality may apply tax increments
14 retained pursuant to this subchapter to debt incurred within the period
