Whereas, the U.S. military engagement in Vietnam began in 1950, when, on the
advice of his National Security Council, President Truman authorized military aid for
French armed forces battling in Indochina, and, in July 1959, two American military
advisors were killed in a guerrilla attack, and
Whereas, as the challenges for the South Vietnamese government increased, the
American military advisory presence expanded, and
Whereas, in August 1964, while stationed off the Vietnamese coast in the Gulf of
Tonkin, the American destroyer USS Maddox sustained damage from North Vietnamese
fire, and in response, Congress adopted the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, increasing
President Johnsonâ€™s authority to engage militarily in Vietnam, and
Whereas, in March 1965, the first American combat troops arrived at Da Nang, South
Vietnam, and during the following years, American forces fought bravely and at great
peril, and according to the 2021 data of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, 58,281
U.S. military personnel, including 100 Vermonters, died in combat or noncombat
situations during the Vietnam War, while over 300,000 American soldiers were
wounded, and
Whereas, although a cease-fire agreement was signed in January 1973 and the last
U.S. ground troops withdrew from the country in March 1973, the Vietnam War
continued until April 30, 1975, when North Vietnam captured the South Vietnamese
capital, then known as Saigon, and the conflict concluded, and
Whereas, Vietnam War veterans served their country heroically and many continue to
face physical and mental health challenges due to their military service, and
Whereas, today, April 30, 2025, marks the 50th anniversary of the conclusion of the
Vietnam War, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly commemorates the 50th anniversary of the conclusion of
the Vietnam War, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the Vermont State Council of the Vietnam Veterans of America, the American Legion
Department of Vermont, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars Department of Vermont.
