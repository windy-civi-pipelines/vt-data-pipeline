Act No. 6 (H.80). An act relating to the Office of the Health Care Advocate
Subjects: Health; health insurance; Office of the Health Care Advocate; certificates
of need
This act modifies the role and duties of the Office of the Health Care Advocate as they
relate to health care regulatory activities, access to information, and providing assistance
to Vermonters. The act expands the Office’s ability to ask questions about health
insurance rate filings and requires the Green Mountain Care Board to make the entire
record of a health insurance rate review available to the public after redacting
confidential information. It enlarges the roles of the Office of the Health Care Advocate
and the Long-Term Care Ombudsman’s Office when they intervene in a certificate of
need application. The act allows the Office of the Health Care Advocate to be
administered by more than one director and expands the scope of the Office’s duties
beyond health insurance to include affordability and access to health care for all
Vermonters. The act requires State agencies to seek input from the Office when
developing policies affecting health care access and affordability and to allow the Office
access to confidential or proprietary information when appropriate, as long as the Office
does not further disclose that information. The act also specifies that the conflict-of-
interest policy for the Office would permit an employee to serve as a volunteer on the
board of a nonprofit health care entity whose primary regulator is not the State of
Vermont.
