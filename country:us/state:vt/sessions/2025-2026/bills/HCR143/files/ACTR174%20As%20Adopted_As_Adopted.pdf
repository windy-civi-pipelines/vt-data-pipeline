(H.C.R.143)
Offered by Representatives Pritchard of Pawlet and McCoy of Poultney
Offered by Senators Collamore, Weeks, and Williams
Whereas, the municipal government employment of Dave Ricard for the Town of
Pawlet started in 2003 when he was first elected as the town’s first constable, and
Whereas, over the course of 22 years, he improved the professionalism of policing
services in the Town of Pawlet, assisting local colleagues who followed his path and
earned their law enforcement officer certifications, and
Whereas, although Dave Ricard’s primary public service responsibility was working
as Pawlet First Constable, which he executed professionally and proficiently, he also
performed other municipal roles with the same degree of attention and excellence,
including serving as the West Pawlet Volunteer Fire Chief; as a patrol officer in Fair
Haven; and as the Wells highway foreman, keeping tabs on that community’s town road
conditions, and
Whereas, after over two decades of overseeing law enforcement activities in the Town
of Pawlet, in 2025, Dave Ricard declined to seek reelection, concluding his exemplary
career as the town’s first constable, and his fellow citizens greatly appreciate his
contribution to civic life in their community, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly honors former Pawlet First Constable David Ricard Sr. for
his outstanding municipal public service, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Dave Ricard.
