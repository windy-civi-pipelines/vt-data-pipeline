16 consent; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be deemed to
17 limit the rights of the accused person to return voluntarily and without
18 formality to the demanding state, nor shall this waiver procedure be deemed to
19 be an exclusive procedure or to limit the powers, rights, or duties of the
20 officers of the demanding state or of this State.
