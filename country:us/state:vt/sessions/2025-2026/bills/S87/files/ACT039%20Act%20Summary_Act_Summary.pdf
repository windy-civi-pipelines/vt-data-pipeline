Act No. 39 (S.87). An act relating to extradition procedures
Subjects: Crimes and criminal procedure; extradition
This act makes changes to the amount of time a person may be held by Vermont while
awaiting the warrant from the Governor of the demanding state and recognizes a waiver
of extradition previously signed by the accused as a term of the personâ€™s current
probation, parole, bail, or other release in the demanding state.
The act extends the amount of time a person may be held by the holding state while
awaiting the warrant from the Governor of the demanding state from 30 to 90 days and
shortens the amount of time the holding state may request as an extension to the time
provided from 60 to 30 days. Current law allows for a maximum time in custody of the
holding state of 90 days and the act extends it to 120 days.
The act also recognizes a waiver of extradition previously signed by the accused as
valid in Vermont and directs that the waiver should be treated as if the fugitive had
signed the waiver in accordance with current procedures. While the waiver is presumed
valid, the fugitive may challenge the validity of the waiver, but if the court finds that the
waiver is valid, it may proceed as if the person had consented to return to the demanding
state.
Effective Date: May 28, 2025 and applies prospectively and does not affect extraditions
