4 Sec. 1. 13 V.S.A. § 4955 is amended to read:
5 § 4955. COMMITMENT TO AWAIT EXTRADITION; BAIL
6 If upon examination it appears that the person held is the person charged
7 with having committed the crime alleged and that the person probably
8 committed the crime, and, except in cases arising under section 4946 of this
9 title, that the person has fled from justice, the judge or magistrate shall commit
10 the person to jail by a warrant, reciting the accusation, for such a time, not
11 exceeding 30 90 days, to be specified in the warrant as will enable the arrest of
12 the accused to be made under a warrant of the Governor on a requisition of the
13 executive authority of the state having jurisdiction of the offense, unless the
14 accused give bail as provided in section 4956 of this title, or until the person
15 shall be legally discharged. On request of the state, the hearing may be
16 continued for up to three working business days, only for the purpose of
17 determining whether the person probably committed the crime. Findings under
18 this section may be based upon hearsay evidence or upon copies of affidavits,
19 whether certified or not, made outside this State. It shall be sufficient for a
20 finding that a person probably committed the crime that there is a current grand
21 jury indictment from another state.
