the enacting clause and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
Sec. 1. 13 V.S.A. § 4955 is amended to read:

Section 2:
§ 4955. COMMITMENT TO AWAIT EXTRADITION; BAIL
If upon examination it appears that the person held is the person charged
with having committed the crime alleged and that the person probably
committed the crime, and, except in cases arising under section 4946 of this
title, that the person has fled from justice, the judge or magistrate shall commit
the person to jail by a warrant, reciting the accusation, for such a time, not
exceeding 30 90 days, to be specified in the warrant as will enable the arrest of

accused give bail as provided in section 4956 of this title, or until the person
shall be legally discharged. On request of the state, the hearing may be

determining whether the person probably committed the crime. Findings

all other procedure incidental to extradition proceedings, by executing or

an extradition warrant by the Governor of this State within 90 days or admit
such person to bail pending the issuance of such warrant. The judge shall
