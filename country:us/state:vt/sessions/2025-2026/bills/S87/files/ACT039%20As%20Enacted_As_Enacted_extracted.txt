Section 2:
§ 4955. COMMITMENT TO AWAIT EXTRADITION; BAIL
If upon examination it appears that the person held is the person charged
with having committed the crime alleged and that the person probably
committed the crime, and, except in cases arising under section 4946 of this
title, that the person has fled from justice, the judge or magistrate shall commit
the person to jail by a warrant, reciting the accusation, for such a time, not
exceeding 30 90 days, to be specified in the warrant as will enable the arrest of
the accused to be made under a warrant of the Governor on a requisition of the
executive authority of the state having jurisdiction of the offense, unless the
accused give bail as provided in section 4956 of this title, or until the person
shall be legally discharged. On request of the state, the hearing may be

determining whether the person probably committed the crime. Findings under
this section may be based upon hearsay evidence or upon copies of affidavits,
whether certified or not, made outside this State. It shall be sufficient for a
