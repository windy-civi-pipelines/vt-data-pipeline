outstanding leadership of HANDS.
(H.C.R.53)
Offered by Representatives Krowinski of Burlington, Bluemle of Burlington, Cina of
Burlington, Headrick of Burlington, Hooper of Burlington, Kleppner of Burlington,
Logan of Burlington, Ode of Burlington, Rachelson of Burlington, and Stone of
Burlington
Whereas, HANDS (Helping and Nurturing Diverse Seniors) is a Chittenden County
nonprofit organization dedicated to “providing food and resources for people aged 50+
who struggle with food insecurity,” and
Whereas, for a quarter of a century, Megan Humphrey served as the inspirational
leader of HANDS and ensured the organization fulfilled its mission as effectively as
possible, and
Whereas, under her guidance, HANDS evolved from offering Christmas dinners and
friendship to seniors who were otherwise alone on the holiday to a far more extensive
operation providing nourishment and food guidance to seniors in Chittenden County, and
Whereas, during the 2024 holiday season, HANDS distributed approximately 1,700
grocery gift cards to older adults struggling with food insecurity, and
Whereas, HANDS has also established gardening programs at local senior centers,
offered healthy eating workshops, and partnered with food shelves and other similar
entities to expand the scope of its programs, and
Whereas, after an outstanding quarter century developing services to feed older
Chittenden County residents in need of food support, Megan Humphrey is concluding her
leadership duties but intends to remain involved in this endeavor as a HANDS volunteer,
now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly honors Megan Humphrey for her outstanding leadership of
HANDS and wishes her every success in her future endeavors, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Megan Humphrey and to HANDS.
