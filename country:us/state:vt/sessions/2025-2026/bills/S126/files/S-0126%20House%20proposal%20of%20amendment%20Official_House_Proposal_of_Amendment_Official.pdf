Sec. 2. 18 V.S.A. § 9375 is amended to read:
§ 9375. DUTIES
(a) The Board shall execute its duties consistent with the principles
expressed in section 9371 of this title.
(b) The Board shall have the following duties:
(1) Oversee the development and implementation, and evaluate the
effectiveness, of health care payment and delivery system reforms designed to
control the rate of growth in health care costs; promote seamless care,
administration, and service delivery; and maintain health care quality in
Vermont, including ensuring that the payment reform pilot projects set forth in
this chapter are consistent with such reforms.

(A) Implement by rule, pursuant to 3 V.S.A. chapter 25,
methodologies for achieving payment reform and containing costs that may
include the participation of Medicare and Medicaid, which may include the
creation of health care professional cost-containment targets, reference-based
pricing, global payments, bundled payments, global budgets, risk-adjusted
capitated payments, or other uniform payment methods and amounts for
integrated delivery systems, health care professionals, or other provider
arrangements.
* * *
(5) Set rates for health care professionals pursuant to section 9376 of
this title, to be implemented over time beginning with reference-based pricing
as soon as practicable, but not later than hospital fiscal year 2027, and make
adjustments to the rules on reimbursement methodologies as needed.
(6) Approve, modify, or disapprove requests for health insurance rates
pursuant to 8 V.S.A. § 4062, taking into consideration the requirements in the
underlying statutes,; changes in health care delivery,; changes in payment
methods and amounts, including implementation of reference-based pricing;
protecting insurer solvency,; and other issues at the discretion of the Board.
(7) Review and establish hospital budgets pursuant to chapter 221,
subchapter 7 of this title.
* * *
Sec. 3. 18 V.S.A. § 9376 is amended to read:
§ 9376. PAYMENT AMOUNTS; METHODS
(a) Intent. It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure payments to
health care professionals that are consistent with efficiency, economy, and
quality of care and will permit them to provide, on a solvent basis, effective
and efficient health services that are in the public interest. It is also the intent
of the General Assembly to eliminate the shift of costs between the payers of
health services to ensure that the amount paid to health care professionals is
sufficient to enlist enough providers to ensure that health services are available
to all Vermonters and are distributed equitably.
(b) Rate-setting.
(1) The Board shall set reasonable rates for health care professionals,
health care provider bargaining groups created pursuant to section 9409 of this
title, manufacturers of prescribed products, medical supply companies, and
other companies providing health services or health supplies based on
methodologies pursuant to section 9375 of this title, in order to have a
consistent reimbursement amount accepted by these persons. In its discretion,
the Board may implement rate-setting for different groups of health care

professionals over time and need not set rates for all types of health care
professionals. In establishing rates, the Board may consider legitimate
differences in costs among health care professionals, such as the cost of
providing a specific necessary service or services that may not be available
elsewhere in the State, and the need for health care professionals in particular
areas of the State, particularly in underserved geographic or practice shortage
areas.
(2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to:
(A) limit the ability of a health care professional to accept less than
the rate established in subdivision (1) of this subsection (b) from a patient
without health insurance or other coverage for the service or services received;
or
(B) reduce or limit the covered services offered by Medicare or
Medicaid.
(c) Methodologies. The Board shall approve payment methodologies that
encourage cost-containment; provision of high-quality, evidence-based health
services in an integrated setting; patient self-management; access to primary
care health services for underserved individuals, populations, and areas; and
healthy lifestyles. Such methodologies shall be consistent with payment
reform and with evidence-based practices, and may include fee-for-service
payments if the Board determines such payments to be appropriate.
(d) Supervision. To the extent required to avoid federal antitrust violations
and in furtherance of the policy identified in subsection (a) of this section, the
Board shall facilitate and supervise the participation of health care
professionals and health care provider bargaining groups in the process
described in subsection (b) of this section.
(e) Reference-based pricing.
(1)(A) The Board shall establish reference-based prices that represent
the maximum amounts that hospitals shall accept as payment in full for items
provided and services delivered in Vermont. The Board may also implement
reference-based pricing for services delivered outside a hospital by setting the
minimum amounts that shall be paid for items provided and services delivered
by nonhospital-based health care professionals. The Board shall consult with
health insurers, hospitals, other health care professionals as applicable, the
Office of the Health Care Advocate, and the Agency of Human Services in
developing reference-based prices pursuant to this subsection (e), including on
ways to achieve all-payer alignment on the design and implementation of
reference-based pricing.
(B) The Board shall implement reference-based pricing in a manner
that does not allow health care professionals to charge or collect from patients

or health insurers any amount in excess of the reference-based amount
established by the Board.
(2)(A) Reference-based prices established pursuant to this subsection (e)
shall be based on a percentage of the Medicare reimbursement for the same or
a similar item or service or on another benchmark, as appropriate, provided
that if the Board establishes prices that are referenced to Medicare, the Board
may opt to update the prices in the future based on a reasonable rate of growth
that is separate from Medicare rates, such as the Medicare Economic Index
measure of inflation, in order to provide predictability and consistency for
health care professionals and payers and to protect against federal funding
pressures that may impact Medicare rates in an unpredictable manner. The
Board may also reference to, and update based on, other payment or pricing
systems where appropriate.
(B) In establishing reference-based prices for a hospital pursuant to
this subsection (e), the Board shall consider the composition of the
communities served by the hospital, including the health of the population,
demographic characteristics, acuity, payer mix, labor costs, social risk factors,
and other factors that may affect the costs of providing care in the hospital
service area, as well as the hospital’s role in Vermont’s health care system.
(3)(A) The Board shall begin implementing reference-based pricing as
soon as practicable but not later than hospital fiscal year 2027 by establishing
the maximum amounts that Vermont hospitals shall accept as payment in full
for items provided and services delivered. After initial implementation, the
Board shall review the reference-based prices for each hospital annually as part
of the hospital budget review process set forth in chapter 221, subchapter 7 of
this title.
(B) The Board, in collaboration with the Department of Financial
Regulation, shall monitor the implementation of reference-based pricing to
ensure that any decreases in amounts paid to hospitals also result in decreases
in health insurance premiums. The Board shall post its findings regarding the
alignment between price decreases and premium decreases annually on its
website.
(4) The Board shall identify factors that would necessitate terminating
or modifying the use of reference-based pricing in one or more hospitals, such
as a measurable reduction in access to or quality of care.
(5) The Green Mountain Care Board, in consultation with the Agency of
Human Services and the Comprehensive Primary Health Care Steering
Committee established pursuant to section 9407 of this title, may implement
reference-based pricing for services delivered outside a hospital, such as
primary care services, and may increase or decrease the percentage of
Medicare or another benchmark as appropriate, first to enhance access to

primary care and later for alignment with the Statewide Health Care Delivery
Strategic Plan established pursuant to section 9403 of this title, once
established. The Board may consider establishing reference-based pricing for
services delivered outside a hospital by setting minimum amounts that shall be
paid for the purpose of prioritizing access to high-quality health care services
in settings that are appropriate to patients’ needs in order to contain costs and
improve patient outcomes.
(6) The Board’s authority to establish reference-based prices pursuant to
this subsection shall not include the authority to set amounts applicable to
items provided or services delivered to patients who are enrolled in Medicare
or Medicaid.
