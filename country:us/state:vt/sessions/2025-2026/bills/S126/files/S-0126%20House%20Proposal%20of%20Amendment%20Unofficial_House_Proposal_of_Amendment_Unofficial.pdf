15 * * *
16 Sec. 3. 18 V.S.A. § 9376 is amended to read:
17 § 9376. PAYMENT AMOUNTS; METHODS
18 (a) Intent. It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure payments to
19 health care professionals that are consistent with efficiency, economy, and
20 quality of care and will permit them to provide, on a solvent basis, effective
21 and efficient health services that are in the public interest. It is also the intent
VT LEG #383750 v.1

HOUSE PROPOSAL OF AMENDMENT S.126
2025 Page 4 of 42
1 of the General Assembly to eliminate the shift of costs between the payers of
2 health services to ensure that the amount paid to health care professionals is
3 sufficient to enlist enough providers to ensure that health services are available
4 to all Vermonters and are distributed equitably.
5 (b) Rate-setting.
6 (1) The Board shall set reasonable rates for health care professionals,
7 health care provider bargaining groups created pursuant to section 9409 of this
8 title, manufacturers of prescribed products, medical supply companies, and
9 other companies providing health services or health supplies based on
10 methodologies pursuant to section 9375 of this title, in order to have a
11 consistent reimbursement amount accepted by these persons. In its discretion,
12 the Board may implement rate-setting for different groups of health care
13 professionals over time and need not set rates for all types of health care
14 professionals. In establishing rates, the Board may consider legitimate
15 differences in costs among health care professionals, such as the cost of
16 providing a specific necessary service or services that may not be available
17 elsewhere in the State, and the need for health care professionals in particular
18 areas of the State, particularly in underserved geographic or practice shortage
19 areas.

1 (2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to:
2 (A) limit the ability of a health care professional to accept less than

4 without health insurance or other coverage for the service or services received;
5 or
6 (B) reduce or limit the covered services offered by Medicare or
7 Medicaid.
8 (c) Methodologies. The Board shall approve payment methodologies that
9 encourage cost-containment; provision of high-quality, evidence-based health
10 services in an integrated setting; patient self-management; access to primary
11 care health services for underserved individuals, populations, and areas; and
12 healthy lifestyles. Such methodologies shall be consistent with payment
13 reform and with evidence-based practices, and may include fee-for-service
14 payments if the Board determines such payments to be appropriate.
15 (d) Supervision. To the extent required to avoid federal antitrust violations
16 and in furtherance of the policy identified in subsection (a) of this section, the
17 Board shall facilitate and supervise the participation of health care
18 professionals and health care provider bargaining groups in the process
19 described in subsection (b) of this section.

HOUSE PROPOSAL OF AMENDMENT S.126
2025 Page 6 of 42
1 (1)(A) The Board shall establish reference-based prices that represent
2 the maximum amounts that hospitals shall accept as payment in full for items
3 provided and services delivered in Vermont. The Board may also implement
4 reference-based pricing for services delivered outside a hospital by setting the
5 minimum amounts that shall be paid for items provided and services delivered
6 by nonhospital-based health care professionals. The Board shall consult with
7 health insurers, hospitals, other health care professionals as applicable, the
8 Office of the Health Care Advocate, and the Agency of Human Services in
9 developing reference-based prices pursuant to this subsection (e), including on
10 ways to achieve all-payer alignment on the design and implementation of
11 reference-based pricing.
12 (B) The Board shall implement reference-based pricing in a manner
13 that does not allow health care professionals to charge or collect from patients
14 or health insurers any amount in excess of the reference-based amount
15 established by the Board.
16 (2)(A) Reference-based prices established pursuant to this subsection (e)
17 shall be based on a percentage of the Medicare reimbursement for the same or
18 a similar item or service or on another benchmark, as appropriate, provided
19 that if the Board establishes prices that are referenced to Medicare, the Board
20 may opt to update the prices in the future based on a reasonable rate of growth
21 that is separate from Medicare rates, such as the Medicare Economic Index
VT LEG #383750 v.1

HOUSE PROPOSAL OF AMENDMENT S.126
2025 Page 7 of 42
1 measure of inflation, in order to provide predictability and consistency for
2 health care professionals and payers and to protect against federal funding
3 pressures that may impact Medicare rates in an unpredictable manner. The
4 Board may also reference to, and update based on, other payment or pricing
5 systems where appropriate.
6 (B) In establishing reference-based prices for a hospital pursuant to
7 this subsection (e), the Board shall consider the composition of the
8 communities served by the hospital, including the health of the population,
9 demographic characteristics, acuity, payer mix, labor costs, social risk factors,
10 and other factors that may affect the costs of providing care in the hospital
11 service area, as well as the hospital’s role in Vermont’s health care system.
12 (3)(A) The Board shall begin implementing reference-based pricing as
13 soon as practicable but not later than hospital fiscal year 2027 by establishing
14 the maximum amounts that Vermont hospitals shall accept as payment in full
15 for items provided and services delivered. After initial implementation, the
16 Board shall review the reference-based prices for each hospital annually as part
17 of the hospital budget review process set forth in chapter 221, subchapter 7 of
18 this title.
19 (B) The Board, in collaboration with the Department of Financial
20 Regulation, shall monitor the implementation of reference-based pricing to
21 ensure that any decreases in amounts paid to hospitals also result in decreases
VT LEG #383750 v.1

HOUSE PROPOSAL OF AMENDMENT S.126
2025 Page 8 of 42
1 in health insurance premiums. The Board shall post its findings regarding the
2 alignment between price decreases and premium decreases annually on its
3 website.
4 (4) The Board shall identify factors that would necessitate terminating
5 or modifying the use of reference-based pricing in one or more hospitals, such
6 as a measurable reduction in access to or quality of care.
7 (5) The Green Mountain Care Board, in consultation with the Agency of
8 Human Services and the Comprehensive Primary Health Care Steering
9 Committee established pursuant to section 9407 of this title, may implement
10 reference-based pricing for services delivered outside a hospital, such as
11 primary care services, and may increase or decrease the percentage of
12 Medicare or another benchmark as appropriate, first to enhance access to
13 primary care and later for alignment with the Statewide Health Care Delivery
14 Strategic Plan established pursuant to section 9403 of this title, once
15 established. The Board may consider establishing reference-based pricing for
16 services delivered outside a hospital by setting minimum amounts that shall be
17 paid for the purpose of prioritizing access to high-quality health care services
18 in settings that are appropriate to patients’ needs in order to contain costs and
19 improve patient outcomes.
20 (6) The Board’s authority to establish reference-based prices pursuant to
21 this subsection shall not include the authority to set amounts applicable to
VT LEG #383750 v.1
