1 Sec. 3. 18 V.S.A. § 9376 is amended to read:
2 § 9376. PAYMENT AMOUNTS; METHODS
3 (a) Intent. It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure payments to
4 health care professionals that are consistent with efficiency, economy, and
5 quality of care and will permit them to provide, on a solvent basis, effective
6 and efficient health services that are in the public interest. It is also the intent
7 of the General Assembly to eliminate the shift of costs between the payers of
8 health services to ensure that the amount paid to health care professionals is
9 sufficient to enlist enough providers to ensure that health services are available
10 to all Vermonters and are distributed equitably.
11 (b) Rate-setting.
12 (1) The Board shall set reasonable rates for health care professionals,
13 health care provider bargaining groups created pursuant to section 9409 of this
14 title, manufacturers of prescribed products, medical supply companies, and
15 other companies providing health services or health supplies based on
16 methodologies pursuant to section 9375 of this title, in order to have a
17 consistent reimbursement amount accepted by these persons. In its discretion,
18 the Board may implement rate-setting for different groups of health care
19 professionals over time and need not set rates for all types of health care
20 professionals. In establishing rates, the Board may consider legitimate
21 differences in costs among health care professionals, such as the cost of
VT LEG #382250 v.1
AS PASSED BY SENATE S.126
2025 Page 5 of 30
1 providing a specific necessary service or services that may not be available
2 elsewhere in the State, and the need for health care professionals in particular
3 areas of the State, particularly in underserved geographic or practice shortage
4 areas.
5 (2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to:
6 (A) limit the ability of a health care professional to accept less than
7 the rate established in subdivision (1) of this subsection (b) from a patient
8 without health insurance or other coverage for the service or services received;
9 or
10 (B) reduce or limit the covered services offered by Medicare or
11 Medicaid.
12 (c) Methodologies. The Board shall approve payment methodologies that
13 encourage cost-containment; provision of high-quality, evidence-based health
14 services in an integrated setting; patient self-management; access to primary
15 care health services for underserved individuals, populations, and areas; and
16 healthy lifestyles. Such methodologies shall be consistent with payment
17 reform and with evidence-based practices, and may include fee-for-service
18 payments if the Board determines such payments to be appropriate.
19 (d) Supervision. To the extent required to avoid federal antitrust violations
20 and in furtherance of the policy identified in subsection (a) of this section, the
21 Board shall facilitate and supervise the participation of health care
VT LEG #382250 v.1
AS PASSED BY SENATE S.126
2025 Page 6 of 30
1 professionals and health care provider bargaining groups in the process
2 described in subsection (b) of this section.
3 (e) Reference-based pricing.
4 (1) The Board shall establish reference-based prices that represent the
5 amounts that health insurers in this State shall pay to hospitals for items
6 provided and services delivered in Vermont. The purposes of reference-based
7 pricing are to contain costs and to move health care professionals toward a site-
8 neutral pricing structure while also allowing the Board to differentiate prices
9 among health care professionals based on factors such as demographics,
10 population health in a given hospital service area, payer mix, acuity, social risk
11 factors, and a specific health care professional’s role in Vermont’s health care
12 system. The Board shall consult with health insurers, hospitals, other health
13 care professionals as applicable, the Office of the Health Care Advocate, and
14 the Agency of Human Services on ways to approach reference-based pricing in
15 an effort to achieve all-payer alignment on design and implementation of the
16 program.
17 (2)(A) Reference-based prices established pursuant to this subsection (e)
18 shall be based on a percentage of the Medicare reimbursement rate for the
19 same or a similar item or service, provided that after the Board establishes
20 initial prices that are referenced to Medicare, the Board may opt to update the
21 prices in the future based on a reasonable rate of growth that is separate from
VT LEG #382250 v.1
AS PASSED BY SENATE S.126
2025 Page 7 of 30
1 Medicare rates, such as the Medicare Economic Index measure of inflation, in
2 order to provide predictability and consistency for health care professionals
3 and payers and to protect against federal funding pressures that may impact
4 Medicare rates in an unpredictable manner.
5 (B) In establishing reference-based prices pursuant to this subsection
6 (e), the Board shall consider the composition of the communities served by the
7 hospital, including the health of the population, demographic characteristics,
8 acuity, payer mix, labor costs, social risk factors, and other factors that may
9 affect the costs of providing care in the hospital service area.
10 (3)(A) The Board shall begin implementing reference-based pricing by
11 establishing the amounts that health insurers in this State shall pay to Vermont
12 hospitals for items provided and services delivered to individuals covered by
13 the health insurer’s plans as soon as practicable but not later than hospital
14 fiscal year 2027.
15 (B) The Board shall implement reference-based pricing in a manner
16 that does not allow hospitals to charge or collect from patients any amount in
17 excess of the reference-based amount established by the Board for the item
18 provided or service delivered.
19 (C) The Board, in collaboration with the Department of Financial
20 Regulation, shall monitor the implementation of reference-based pricing to
21 ensure that any decreased prices paid to hospitals result in commensurate
VT LEG #382250 v.1
AS PASSED BY SENATE S.126
2025 Page 8 of 30
1 decreases in health insurance premiums. The Board shall post its findings
2 regarding the alignment between price decreases and premium decreases
3 annually on its website.
4 (4) The Board shall identify factors that would necessitate terminating
5 the use of reference-based pricing in one or more hospitals, such as a reduction
6 in access to or quality of care.
7 (5) The Agency of Human Services, in consultation with the Green
8 Mountain Care Board, may implement reference-based pricing for services
9 delivered outside a hospital, such as primary care services, and may increase or
10 decrease the percentage of Medicare or another benchmark as appropriate, first
11 to enhance access to primary care and later for alignment with the Statewide
12 Health Care Delivery Plan established pursuant to section 9403 of this title,
13 once established.
14 Sec. 4. 18 V.S.A. § 9454 is amended to read:
15 § 9454. HOSPITALS; DUTIES
16 (a) Hospitals shall file the following information at the time and place and
17 in the manner established by the Board:

12 for Health, Choices for Care, and Support and Services at Home (SASH);
13 investments in the health care workforce; and other nonhospital aspects of
14 Vermont’s health and human services systems that affect population health
15 outcomes, including the social drivers of health; and
16 (10) such other information as the Board may require.
17 (b) Hospitals shall submit information as directed by the Board in order to
18 maximize hospital budget data standardization and allow the Board to make

1 Sec. 3. 18 V.S.A. § 9376 is amended to read:
2 § 9376. PAYMENT AMOUNTS; METHODS
3 (a) Intent. It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure payments to
4 health care professionals that are consistent with efficiency, economy, and
5 quality of care and will permit them to provide, on a solvent basis, effective
6 and efficient health services that are in the public interest. It is also the intent
7 of the General Assembly to eliminate the shift of costs between the payers of
8 health services to ensure that the amount paid to health care professionals is
9 sufficient to enlist enough providers to ensure that health services are available
10 to all Vermonters and are distributed equitably.
11 (b) Rate-setting.
12 (1) The Board shall set reasonable rates for health care professionals,
13 health care provider bargaining groups created pursuant to section 9409 of this
14 title, manufacturers of prescribed products, medical supply companies, and
15 other companies providing health services or health supplies based on
16 methodologies pursuant to section 9375 of this title, in order to have a
17 consistent reimbursement amount accepted by these persons. In its discretion,
18 the Board may implement rate-setting for different groups of health care
19 professionals over time and need not set rates for all types of health care
20 professionals. In establishing rates, the Board may consider legitimate
21 differences in costs among health care professionals, such as the cost of
VT LEG #382250 v.1

AS PASSED BY SENATE S.126
2025 Page 5 of 30
1 providing a specific necessary service or services that may not be available
2 elsewhere in the State, and the need for health care professionals in particular
3 areas of the State, particularly in underserved geographic or practice shortage
4 areas.
5 (2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to:
6 (A) limit the ability of a health care professional to accept less than
7 the rate established in subdivision (1) of this subsection (b) from a patient
8 without health insurance or other coverage for the service or services received;
9 or
10 (B) reduce or limit the covered services offered by Medicare or
11 Medicaid.
12 (c) Methodologies. The Board shall approve payment methodologies that
13 encourage cost-containment; provision of high-quality, evidence-based health
14 services in an integrated setting; patient self-management; access to primary
15 care health services for underserved individuals, populations, and areas; and
16 healthy lifestyles. Such methodologies shall be consistent with payment
17 reform and with evidence-based practices, and may include fee-for-service
18 payments if the Board determines such payments to be appropriate.
19 (d) Supervision. To the extent required to avoid federal antitrust violations
20 and in furtherance of the policy identified in subsection (a) of this section, the
21 Board shall facilitate and supervise the participation of health care
VT LEG #382250 v.1

AS PASSED BY SENATE S.126
2025 Page 6 of 30
1 professionals and health care provider bargaining groups in the process
2 described in subsection (b) of this section.
3 (e) Reference-based pricing.
4 (1) The Board shall establish reference-based prices that represent the
5 amounts that health insurers in this State shall pay to hospitals for items
6 provided and services delivered in Vermont. The purposes of reference-based
7 pricing are to contain costs and to move health care professionals toward a site-
8 neutral pricing structure while also allowing the Board to differentiate prices
9 among health care professionals based on factors such as demographics,
10 population health in a given hospital service area, payer mix, acuity, social risk
11 factors, and a specific health care professional’s role in Vermont’s health care
12 system. The Board shall consult with health insurers, hospitals, other health
13 care professionals as applicable, the Office of the Health Care Advocate, and
14 the Agency of Human Services on ways to approach reference-based pricing in
15 an effort to achieve all-payer alignment on design and implementation of the
16 program.
17 (2)(A) Reference-based prices established pursuant to this subsection (e)
18 shall be based on a percentage of the Medicare reimbursement rate for the
19 same or a similar item or service, provided that after the Board establishes
20 initial prices that are referenced to Medicare, the Board may opt to update the
21 prices in the future based on a reasonable rate of growth that is separate from
VT LEG #382250 v.1

AS PASSED BY SENATE S.126
2025 Page 7 of 30
1 Medicare rates, such as the Medicare Economic Index measure of inflation, in
2 order to provide predictability and consistency for health care professionals
3 and payers and to protect against federal funding pressures that may impact
4 Medicare rates in an unpredictable manner.
5 (B) In establishing reference-based prices pursuant to this subsection
6 (e), the Board shall consider the composition of the communities served by the
7 hospital, including the health of the population, demographic characteristics,
8 acuity, payer mix, labor costs, social risk factors, and other factors that may
9 affect the costs of providing care in the hospital service area.
10 (3)(A) The Board shall begin implementing reference-based pricing by
11 establishing the amounts that health insurers in this State shall pay to Vermont
12 hospitals for items provided and services delivered to individuals covered by
13 the health insurer’s plans as soon as practicable but not later than hospital
14 fiscal year 2027.
15 (B) The Board shall implement reference-based pricing in a manner
16 that does not allow hospitals to charge or collect from patients any amount in
17 excess of the reference-based amount established by the Board for the item
18 provided or service delivered.
19 (C) The Board, in collaboration with the Department of Financial
20 Regulation, shall monitor the implementation of reference-based pricing to
21 ensure that any decreased prices paid to hospitals result in commensurate
VT LEG #382250 v.1

AS PASSED BY SENATE S.126
2025 Page 8 of 30
1 decreases in health insurance premiums. The Board shall post its findings
2 regarding the alignment between price decreases and premium decreases
3 annually on its website.
4 (4) The Board shall identify factors that would necessitate terminating
5 the use of reference-based pricing in one or more hospitals, such as a reduction
6 in access to or quality of care.
7 (5) The Agency of Human Services, in consultation with the Green
8 Mountain Care Board, may implement reference-based pricing for services
9 delivered outside a hospital, such as primary care services, and may increase or
10 decrease the percentage of Medicare or another benchmark as appropriate, first
11 to enhance access to primary care and later for alignment with the Statewide
12 Health Care Delivery Plan established pursuant to section 9403 of this title,
13 once established.
14 Sec. 4. 18 V.S.A. § 9454 is amended to read:
15 § 9454. HOSPITALS; DUTIES
16 (a) Hospitals shall file the following information at the time and place and
17 in the manner established by the Board:

20 capital expenditure projection, and a one-year capital expenditure plan; and

3 employees whose duties primarily involve delivering health care services
4 directly to hospital patients;
5 (8) information regarding base salaries and total compensation for the
6 hospital’s executive and clinical leadership and for its employees who deliver
7 health care services directly to hospital patients;
8 (9) proposals for ways in which the hospital can support community-
9 based, independent, and nonhospital providers, including mental health and
10 substance use disorder treatment providers, primary care providers, long-term
11 care providers, and physical therapists; services provided through the Blueprint
12 for Health, Choices for Care, and Support and Services at Home (SASH);
13 investments in the health care workforce; and other nonhospital aspects of
14 Vermont’s health and human services systems that affect population health
15 outcomes, including the social drivers of health; and
16 (10) such other information as the Board may require.
17 (b) Hospitals shall submit information as directed by the Board in order to
18 maximize hospital budget data standardization and allow the Board to make
19 direct comparisons of hospital expenses across the health care system.
20 (c) Hospitals shall adopt a fiscal year that shall begin on October 1.
