is intended to provide a general summary of the act and may not be exhaustive. It has been prepared by the
staff of the Office of Legislative Counsel without input from members of the General Assembly. It is not
intended to aid in the interpretation of legislation or to serve as a source of legislative intent.
Act No. 68 (S.126). An act relating to health care payment and delivery system reform
Subjects: Health; health care reform; Green Mountain Care Board; Agency of
Human Services; hospitals; health information technology; Statewide Health Care
Delivery Strategic Plan; reference-based pricing; global hospital budgets
This act requires the Green Mountain Care Board (GMCB) to establish, as soon as
practicable but not later than hospital fiscal year 2027, reference-based prices that
represent the maximum amounts that Vermont hospitals can accept as payment in full for
items and services delivered in Vermont. It allows the GMCB, in consultation with the
Agency of Human Services (AHS) and others, to implement reference-based pricing for
services delivered outside a hospital, such as primary care services. The act also requires
the GMCB to establish global hospital budgets, if resources are available, for one or more
non-critical access hospitals by hospital fiscal year 2027 and for all Vermont hospitals by
hospital fiscal year 2030. It requires hospitals to submit budget information as directed
by the GMCB in order to create greater hospital budget data standardization and enable
the GMCB to compare hospitals’ expenses. It establishes additional considerations and
requirements for the GMCB to undertake in its hospital budget reviews. The act requires
that a hospital that proposes to reduce or eliminate a service in order to comply with its
budget order provide notice of intent to the GMCB, AHS, the Office of the Health Care
Advocate, and legislators who represent the hospital service area at least 45 days in
advance and it allows the GMCB to modify the hospital’s budget or take other
appropriate action to preserve access to necessary services. The act gives the GMCB
authority to oversee hospital networks that derive 50 percent or more of their operating
revenue from Vermont hospitals and to recommend any action the GMCB deems
necessary to correct aspects of a network or its financial operations that are inconsistent
with the principles for health care reform or with the Statewide Health Care Delivery
Strategic Plan, once established. The act also requires contracting entities and health care
providers to provide an unredacted copy of an executed or proposed health care contract
to the Department of Financial Regulation (DFR) or the GMCB upon request.
The act directs AHS, in collaboration with stakeholders, to lead the development of an
integrated Statewide Health Care Delivery Strategic Plan that defines a shared vision for
improving access, quality, efficiency, and affordability of health care services in Vermont
and identifies relevant resources, opportunities, deficiencies, barriers, and strategies. The
Plan is due to the General Assembly by January 15, 2028, and AHS must update it every
three years, with the first updated Plan due by December 1, 2030. The act creates the 18-
member Health Care Delivery Advisory Committee to establish affordability
benchmarks, evaluate and monitor the performance of Vermont’s health care system and
its impacts on population health outcomes, collaborate with stakeholders on the Statewide
Health Care Delivery Strategic Plan, consider recommendations for the primary care
steering committee, advise the GMCB on monitoring the performance of the health care

delivery system, and provide coordinated and consensus recommendations to the General
Assembly on issues related to health care delivery, including primary care, and
population health. The act also creates the 16-member Vermont Steering Committee for
Comprehensive Primary Health Care to inform the work of State government as it relates
to primary care.
The act directs AHS to collaborate with the Health Information Exchange Steering
Committee to develop the Unified Health Data Space and specifies elements of the
development process, including determining whether to integrate clinical and claims data
and, if so, how to protect proprietary information; integration cannot begin before
January 1, 2027, and only if a majority of the Steering Committee votes to do move
forward. A report on the integration of clinical and claims data is due to the General
Assembly by January 15, 2026, and annual updates on development and implementation
of Unified Health Data Space are due beginning on January 15, 2027. The act also
authorizes the GMCB to share any materials it receives pursuant to a subpoena with AHS
or DFR as appropriate to AHS’s or DFR’s work, as long as AHS and DFR agree to
maintain the confidentiality of anything that is exempt from public inspection and
copying under the Public Records Act.
The act directs AHS to facilitate collaboration and coordination among health care
providers to respond to urgent financial pressures and identify opportunities to increase
efficiency, improve quality, reduce prescription drug spending, and increase access to
essential services while reducing hospital spending by not less than 2.5 percent for
hospital fiscal year 2026. By July 1, 2025, AHS must report the proposed reductions it
has approved to the General Assembly and must provide additional monthly updates from
October 1, 2025, through September 30, 2026. The act also directs AHS to identify
specific outcome measures for determining whether, when, and to what extent AHS has
met the health care system transformation goals set forth in 2022 Acts and Resolves No.
167, and to report those measures and related information to the General Assembly each
month from August 1, 2025, through January 1, 2027. The act appropriates $2 million to
AHS for incentive grants to hospitals to encourage them to actively participate in
transformation efforts, including reducing hospital costs and expanding access through
telehealth, and requires AHS to report to the General Assembly by December 1, 2025,
regarding how much of that funding had been obligated and disbursed as of November
15, 2025. The act also requires DFR to provide a plan to the General Assembly by
November 1, 2025, for preserving the sustainability of domestic health insurers in
Vermont. And it directs AHS to report to the General Assembly by December 1, 2025,
on opportunities to retain useful capabilities developed by or on behalf of an accountable
care organization and funded in whole or in part by public dollars.
The act requires the GMCB to report to the General Assembly on its implementation
of this act by February 15, 2026, and requires the GMCB’s annual report to include
updates on reference-based pricing and global hospital budgets and their effects on health
care access, quality, and cost beginning with the 2027 report. The act requires AHS to
provide an update to the General Assembly by February 15 annually on the status of the
Statewide Health Care Delivery Strategic Plan, the activities of the Health Care Delivery
Advisory Committee, and effects of the Plan, the Advisory Committee, and other AHS
efforts on health care access, quality, and cost. The act creates three new positions at the

GMCB in fiscal year 2026, two of which are related to reference-based pricing and one
that is focused on operations, procurement, and contracting. In addition to the $2 million
appropriated to AHS for hospital incentive grants, the act appropriates an additional $2.2
million to AHS for its transformation work, creation of the Statewide Health Care
Delivery Strategic Plan, and development of alternative payment models, and it
appropriates $1,212,500.00 to the GMCB for the three new positions and for contracts
and the standardization of electronic hospital budget data submissions.
