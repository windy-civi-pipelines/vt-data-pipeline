12 (b) The Board shall have the following duties:

20 methodologies for achieving payment reform and containing costs that may
21 include the participation of Medicare and Medicaid, which may include the
VT LEG #381211 v.2

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.126
2025 Page 3 of 32
1 creation of health care professional cost-containment targets, reference-based
2 pricing, global payments, bundled payments, global budgets, risk-adjusted
3 capitated payments, or other uniform payment methods and amounts for
4 integrated delivery systems, health care professionals, or other provider
5 arrangements.
6 * * *
7 (5) Set rates for health care professionals pursuant to section 9376 of
8 this title, to be implemented over time beginning with reference-based pricing
9 as soon as practicable, but not later than 2027, and make adjustments to the
10 rules on reimbursement methodologies as needed.
11 (6) Approve, modify, or disapprove requests for health insurance rates
12 pursuant to 8 V.S.A. § 4062, taking into consideration the requirements in the

20 stakeholders or as set by the Statewide Health Care Delivery Plan developed
21 pursuant to section 9403 of this title, once established. Beginning not later
VT LEG #381211 v.2

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.126
2025 Page 4 of 32
1 than hospital fiscal year 2028, the Board shall establish global hospital budgets
2 for one or more Vermont hospitals that are not critical access hospitals. By
3 hospital fiscal year 2030, the Board shall establish global hospital budgets for
4 all Vermont hospitals.
5 * * *
6 Sec. 3. 18 V.S.A. § 9376 is amended to read:
7 § 9376. PAYMENT AMOUNTS; METHODS
8 (a) Intent. It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure payments to
9 health care professionals that are consistent with efficiency, economy, and
10 quality of care and will permit them to provide, on a solvent basis, effective
11 and efficient health services that are in the public interest. It is also the intent
12 of the General Assembly to eliminate the shift of costs between the payers of
13 health services to ensure that the amount paid to health care professionals is
14 sufficient to enlist enough providers to ensure that health services are available
15 to all Vermonters and are distributed equitably.
16 (b) Rate-setting.
17 (1) The Board shall set reasonable rates for health care professionals,
18 health care provider bargaining groups created pursuant to section 9409 of this
19 title, manufacturers of prescribed products, medical supply companies, and
20 other companies providing health services or health supplies based on
21 methodologies pursuant to section 9375 of this title, in order to have a
VT LEG #381211 v.2

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.126
2025 Page 5 of 32
1 consistent reimbursement amount accepted by these persons. In its discretion,
2 the Board may implement rate-setting for different groups of health care
3 professionals over time and need not set rates for all types of health care
4 professionals. In establishing rates, the Board may consider legitimate
5 differences in costs among health care professionals, such as the cost of
6 providing a specific necessary service or services that may not be available
7 elsewhere in the State, and the need for health care professionals in particular
8 areas of the State, particularly in underserved geographic or practice shortage
9 areas.
10 (2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to:
11 (A) limit the ability of a health care professional to accept less than
12 the rate established in subdivision (1) of this subsection (b) from a patient
13 without health insurance or other coverage for the service or services received;
14 or
15 (B) reduce or limit the covered services offered by Medicare or
16 Medicaid.
17 (c) Methodologies. The Board shall approve payment methodologies that
18 encourage cost-containment; provision of high-quality, evidence-based health
19 services in an integrated setting; patient self-management; access to primary
20 care health services for underserved individuals, populations, and areas; and
21 healthy lifestyles. Such methodologies shall be consistent with payment
VT LEG #381211 v.2

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.126
2025 Page 6 of 32
1 reform and with evidence-based practices, and may include fee-for-service
2 payments if the Board determines such payments to be appropriate.
3 (d) Supervision. To the extent required to avoid federal antitrust violations
4 and in furtherance of the policy identified in subsection (a) of this section, the
5 Board shall facilitate and supervise the participation of health care
6 professionals and health care provider bargaining groups in the process
7 described in subsection (b) of this section.
8 (e) Reference-based pricing.
9 (1) The Board shall establish reference-based prices that represent the
10 amounts that health insurers in this State shall pay to hospitals for items
11 provided and services delivered in Vermont. The purposes of reference-based
12 pricing are to contain costs and to move health care professionals toward a site-
13 neutral pricing structure while also allowing the Board to differentiate prices
14 among health care professionals based on factors such as demographics,
15 population health in a given hospital service area, payer mix, acuity, social risk
16 factors, and a specific health care professional’s role in Vermont’s health care
17 system. The Board shall consult with health insurers, hospitals, other health
18 care professionals as applicable, the Office of the Health Care Advocate, and
19 the Agency of Human Services on ways to approach reference-based pricing in
20 an effort to achieve all-payer alignment on design and implementation of the
21 program.
VT LEG #381211 v.2

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.126
2025 Page 7 of 32
1 (2)(A) Reference-based prices established pursuant to this subsection (e)
2 shall be based on a percentage of the Medicare reimbursement rate for the
3 same or a similar item or service, provided that after the Board establishes
4 initial prices that are referenced to Medicare, the Board may opt to update the
5 prices in the future based on a reasonable rate of growth that is separate from
6 Medicare rates, such as the Medicare Economic Index measure of inflation, in
7 order to provide predictability and consistency for health care professionals
8 and payers and to protect against federal funding pressures that may impact
9 Medicare rates in an unpredictable manner.
10 (B) In establishing reference-based prices pursuant to this subsection
11 (e), the Board shall consider the composition of the communities served by the
12 hospital, including the health of the population, demographic characteristics,
13 acuity, payer mix, labor costs, social risk factors, and other factors that may
14 affect the costs of providing care in the hospital service area.
15 (3)(A) The Board shall begin implementing reference-based pricing by
16 establishing the amounts that health insurers in this State shall pay to Vermont
17 hospitals for items provided and services delivered to individuals covered by
18 the health insurer’s plans as soon as practicable but not later than hospital
19 fiscal year 2027.
20 (B) The Board shall implement reference-based pricing in a manner
21 that does not allow hospitals to charge or collect from patients any amount in
VT LEG #381211 v.2

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.126
2025 Page 8 of 32
1 excess of the reference-based amount established by the Board for the item
2 provided or service delivered.
3 (C) The Board, in collaboration with the Department of Financial
4 Regulation, shall monitor the implementation of reference-based pricing to
5 ensure that any decreased prices paid to hospitals result in commensurate
6 decreases in health insurance premiums. The Board shall post its findings
7 regarding the alignment between price decreases and premium decreases
8 annually on its website.
9 (4) The Board shall identify factors that would necessitate terminating
10 the use of reference-based pricing in one or more hospitals, such as a reduction
11 in access to or quality of care.
12 (5) The Agency of Human Services, in consultation with the Green
13 Mountain Care Board, may implement reference-based pricing for services
14 delivered outside a hospital, such as primary care services, and may increase or
15 decrease the percentage of Medicare or another benchmark as appropriate, first
16 to enhance access to primary care and later for alignment with the Statewide
17 Health Care Delivery Plan established pursuant to section 9403 of this title,
18 once established.
