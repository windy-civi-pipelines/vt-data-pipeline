BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.126
2025 Page 4 of 57
1 than hospital fiscal year 2028, the Board shall establish global hospital budgets
2 for one or more Vermont hospitals that are not critical access hospitals. By
3 hospital fiscal year 2030, the Board shall establish global hospital budgets for
4 all Vermont hospitals.
5 * * *
6 Sec. 3. 18 V.S.A. § 9376 is amended to read:
7 § 9376. PAYMENT AMOUNTS; METHODS
8 (a) Intent. It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure payments to
9 health care professionals that are consistent with efficiency, economy, and
10 quality of care and will permit them to provide, on a solvent basis, effective
11 and efficient health services that are in the public interest. It is also the intent
12 of the General Assembly to eliminate the shift of costs between the payers of
13 health services to ensure that the amount paid to health care professionals is
14 sufficient to enlist enough providers to ensure that health services are available
15 to all Vermonters and are distributed equitably.
16 (b) Rate-setting.
17 (1) The Board shall set reasonable rates for health care professionals,
18 health care provider bargaining groups created pursuant to section 9409 of this
19 title, manufacturers of prescribed products, medical supply companies, and
20 other companies providing health services or health supplies based on
21 methodologies pursuant to section 9375 of this title, in order to have a

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.126
2025 Page 5 of 57
1 consistent reimbursement amount accepted by these persons. In its discretion,
2 the Board may implement rate-setting for different groups of health care
3 professionals over time and need not set rates for all types of health care
4 professionals. In establishing rates, the Board may consider legitimate
5 differences in costs among health care professionals, such as the cost of
6 providing a specific necessary service or services that may not be available
7 elsewhere in the State, and the need for health care professionals in particular
8 areas of the State, particularly in underserved geographic or practice shortage
9 areas.
10 (2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to:
11 (A) limit the ability of a health care professional to accept less than
12 the rate established in subdivision (1) of this subsection (b) from a patient
13 without health insurance or other coverage for the service or services received;
14 or
15 (B) reduce or limit the covered services offered by Medicare or
16 Medicaid.
17 (c) Methodologies. The Board shall approve payment methodologies that
18 encourage cost-containment; provision of high-quality, evidence-based health
19 services in an integrated setting; patient self-management; access to primary
20 care health services for underserved individuals, populations, and areas; and
21 healthy lifestyles. Such methodologies shall be consistent with payment

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.126
2025 Page 6 of 57
1 reform and with evidence-based practices, and may include fee-for-service
2 payments if the Board determines such payments to be appropriate.
3 (d) Supervision. To the extent required to avoid federal antitrust violations
4 and in furtherance of the policy identified in subsection (a) of this section, the
5 Board shall facilitate and supervise the participation of health care
6 professionals and health care provider bargaining groups in the process
7 described in subsection (b) of this section.
8 (e) Reference-based pricing.
9 (1) The Board shall establish reference-based prices that represent the
10 amounts that health insurers in this State shall pay to hospitals for items
11 provided and services delivered in Vermont. The purposes of reference-based
12 pricing are to contain costs and to move health care professionals toward a
13 site-neutral pricing structure while also allowing the Board to differentiate
14 prices among health care professionals based on factors such as demographics,
15 population health in a given hospital service area, payer mix, acuity, social risk
16 factors, and a specific health care professional’s role in Vermont’s health care
17 system. The Board shall consult with health insurers, hospitals, other health
18 care professionals as applicable, the Office of the Health Care Advocate, and
19 the Agency of Human Services on ways to approach reference-based pricing in
20 an effort to achieve all-payer alignment on design and implementation of the
21 program.

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.126
2025 Page 7 of 57
1 (2)(A) Reference-based prices established pursuant to this subsection (e)
2 shall be based on a percentage of the Medicare reimbursement rate for the
3 same or a similar item or service, provided that after the Board establishes
4 initial prices that are referenced to Medicare, the Board may opt to update the
5 prices in the future based on a reasonable rate of growth that is separate from
6 Medicare rates, such as the Medicare Economic Indexmeasure of inflation, in
7 order to provide predictability and consistency for health care professionals
8 and payers and to protect against federal funding pressures that may impact
9 Medicare rates in an unpredictable manner.
10 (B) In establishing reference-based prices pursuant to this subsection
11 (e), the Board shall consider the composition of the communities served by the
12 hospital, including the health of the population, demographic characteristics,
13 acuity, payer mix, labor costs, social risk factors, and other factors that may
14 affect the costs of providing care in the hospital service area.
15 (3)(A) The Board shall begin implementing reference-based pricing by
16 establishing the amounts that health insurers in this State shall pay to Vermont
17 hospitals for items provided and services delivered to individuals covered by
18 the health insurer’s plans as soon as practicable but not later than hospital
19 fiscal year 2027.
20 (B) The Board shall implement reference-based pricing in a manner
21 that does not allow hospitals to charge or collect from patients any amount in

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.126
2025 Page 8 of 57
1 excess of the reference-based amount established by the Board for the item
2 provided or service delivered.
3 (C) The Board, in collaboration with the Department of Financial
4 Regulation, shall monitor the implementation of reference-based pricing to
5 ensure that any decreased prices paid to hospitals result in commensurate
6 decreases in health insurance premiums. The Board shall post its findings
7 regarding the alignment between price decreases and premium decreases
8 annually on its website.
9 (4) The Board shall identify factors that would necessitate terminating
10 the use of reference-based pricing in one or more hospitals, such as a reduction
11 in access to or quality of care.
12 (5) The Agency of Human Services, in consultation with the Green
13 Mountain Care Board, may implement reference-based pricing for services
14 delivered outside a hospital, such as primary care services, and may increase or
15 decrease the percentage of Medicare or another benchmark as appropriate, first
16 to enhance access to primary care and later for alignment with the Statewide
17 Health Care Delivery Plan established pursuant to section 9403 of this title,
18 once established.

Sec. 1. PURPOSE; GOALS
The purpose of this act is to achieve transformation of and structural
changes to Vermont’s health care system. In enacting this legislation, the
General Assembly intends to advance the following goals:
(1) improvements in health outcomes, population health, quality of care,
regional access to services, and reducing disparities in access resulting from
demographic factors or health status;
(2) an integrated system of care, with robust care coordination and
increased investments in primary care, home health care, and long-term care;
(3) stabilizing health care providers, controlling the costs of commercial
health insurance, and managing hospital costs based on the total cost of care,
beginning with reference-based pricing and continuing on to global hospital
budgets;
(4) evaluating progress in achieving system transformation and
structural changes by creating and applying standardized accountability
metrics; and
(5) establishing a health care system that will attract and retain high-
quality health care professionals to practice in Vermont and that supports,
develops, and preserves the dignity of Vermont’s health care workforce.

Sec. 2. 18 V.S.A. § 9375 is amended to read:
§ 9375. DUTIES
(a) The Board shall execute its duties consistent with the principles
expressed in section 9371 of this title.
(b) The Board shall have the following duties:
(1) Oversee the development and implementation, and evaluate the
effectiveness, of health care payment and delivery system reforms designed to
control the rate of growth in health care costs; promote seamless care,
administration, and service delivery; and maintain health care quality in
Vermont, including ensuring that the payment reform pilot projects set forth in
this chapter are consistent with such reforms.
(A) Implement by rule, pursuant to 3 V.S.A. chapter 25,
methodologies for achieving payment reform and containing costs that may
include the participation of Medicare and Medicaid, which may include the
creation of health care professional cost-containment targets, reference-based

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.126

pricing, global payments, bundled payments, global budgets, risk-adjusted
capitated payments, or other uniform payment methods and amounts for
integrated delivery systems, health care professionals, or other provider
arrangements.
* * *
(5) Set rates for health care professionals pursuant to section 9376 of
this title, to be implemented over time beginning with reference-based pricing
as soon as practicable, but not later than hospital fiscal year 2027, and make
adjustments to the rules on reimbursement methodologies as needed.
(6) Approve, modify, or disapprove requests for health insurance rates
pursuant to 8 V.S.A. § 4062, taking into consideration the requirements in the
underlying statutes,; changes in health care delivery,; changes in payment
methods and amounts, including implementation of reference-based pricing;
protecting insurer solvency,; and other issues at the discretion of the Board.
(7) Review and establish hospital budgets pursuant to chapter 221,
subchapter 7 of this title, including establishing standards for global hospital
budgets that reflect the implementation of reference-based pricing and the total
cost of care targets determined in collaboration with federal partners and
other stakeholders or as set by the Statewide Health Care Delivery Plan
developed pursuant to section 9403 of this title, once established. Beginning
not later than hospital fiscal year 2028, to the extent that resources are
available, the Board shall establish global hospital budgets for one or more
Vermont hospitals that are not critical access hospitals. By hospital fiscal year
2030, to the extent that resources are available, the Board shall establish
global hospital budgets for all Vermont hospitals.

Sec. 3. 18 V.S.A. § 9376 is amended to read:
§ 9376. PAYMENT AMOUNTS; METHODS
(a) Intent. It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure payments to
health care professionals that are consistent with efficiency, economy, and
quality of care and will permit them to provide, on a solvent basis, effective
and efficient health services that are in the public interest. It is also the intent
of the General Assembly to eliminate the shift of costs between the payers of
health services to ensure that the amount paid to health care professionals is
sufficient to enlist enough providers to ensure that health services are available
to all Vermonters and are distributed equitably.
(b) Rate-setting.

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.126
2025 Page 35 of 57
(1) The Board shall set reasonable rates for health care professionals,
health care provider bargaining groups created pursuant to section 9409 of
this title, manufacturers of prescribed products, medical supply companies,
and other companies providing health services or health supplies based on
methodologies pursuant to section 9375 of this title, in order to have a
consistent reimbursement amount accepted by these persons. In its discretion,
the Board may implement rate-setting for different groups of health care
professionals over time and need not set rates for all types of health care
professionals. In establishing rates, the Board may consider legitimate
differences in costs among health care professionals, such as the cost of
providing a specific necessary service or services that may not be available
elsewhere in the State, and the need for health care professionals in particular
areas of the State, particularly in underserved geographic or practice shortage
areas.
(2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to:
(A) limit the ability of a health care professional to accept less than
the rate established in subdivision (1) of this subsection (b) from a patient
without health insurance or other coverage for the service or services received;
or
(B) reduce or limit the covered services offered by Medicare or
Medicaid.
(c) Methodologies. The Board shall approve payment methodologies that
encourage cost-containment; provision of high-quality, evidence-based health
services in an integrated setting; patient self-management; access to primary
care health services for underserved individuals, populations, and areas; and
healthy lifestyles. Such methodologies shall be consistent with payment reform
and with evidence-based practices, and may include fee-for-service payments
if the Board determines such payments to be appropriate.
(d) Supervision. To the extent required to avoid federal antitrust violations
and in furtherance of the policy identified in subsection (a) of this section, the
Board shall facilitate and supervise the participation of health care
professionals and health care provider bargaining groups in the process
described in subsection (b) of this section.
(e) Reference-based pricing.
(1)(A) The Board shall establish reference-based prices that represent
the maximum amounts that hospitals shall accept as payment in full for items
provided and services delivered in Vermont. The Board may also implement
reference-based pricing for services delivered outside a hospital by setting the
minimum amounts that shall be paid for items provided and services delivered

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.126
2025 Page 36 of 57
by nonhospital-based health care professionals. The Board shall consult with
health insurers, hospitals, other health care professionals as applicable, the
Office of the Health Care Advocate, and the Agency of Human Services in
developing reference-based prices pursuant to this subsection (e), including on
ways to achieve all-payer alignment on the design and implementation of
reference-based pricing.
(B) The Board shall implement reference-based pricing in a manner
that does not allow health care professionals to charge or collect from patients
or health insurers any amount in excess of the reference-based amount
established by the Board.
(2)(A) Reference-based prices established pursuant to this subsection (e)
shall be based on a percentage of the Medicare reimbursement for the same or
a similar item or service or on another benchmark, as appropriate, provided
that if the Board establishes prices that are referenced to Medicare, the Board
may opt to update the prices in the future based on a reasonable rate of growth
that is separate from Medicare rates, such as the Medicare Economic Index
measure of inflation, in order to provide predictability and consistency for
health care professionals and payers and to protect against federal funding
pressures that may impact Medicare rates in an unpredictable manner. The
Board may also reference to, and update based on, other payment or pricing
systems where appropriate.
(B) In establishing reference-based prices for a hospital pursuant to
this subsection (e), the Board shall consider the composition of the
communities served by the hospital, including the health of the population,
demographic characteristics, acuity, payer mix, labor costs, social risk factors,
and other factors that may affect the costs of providing care in the hospital
service area, as well as the hospital’s role in Vermont’s health care system.
(3)(A) The Board shall begin implementing reference-based pricing as
soon as practicable but not later than hospital fiscal year 2027 by establishing
the maximum amounts that Vermont hospitals shall accept as payment in full
for items provided and services delivered. After initial implementation, the
Board shall review the reference-based prices for each hospital annually as
part of the hospital budget review process set forth in chapter 221, subchapter
7 of this title.
(B) The Board, in collaboration with the Department of Financial
Regulation, shall monitor the implementation of reference-based pricing to
ensure that any decreases in amounts paid to hospitals also result in decreases
in health insurance premiums. The Board shall post its findings regarding the
alignment between price decreases and premium decreases annually on its
website.

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.126
2025 Page 37 of 57
(4) The Board shall identify factors that would necessitate terminating
or modifying the use of reference-based pricing in one or more hospitals, such
as a measurable reduction in access to or quality of care.
(5) The Green Mountain Care Board, in consultation with the Agency of
Human Services and the Vermont Steering Committee for Comprehensive
Primary Health Care established pursuant to section 9403b of this title, may
implement reference-based pricing for services delivered outside a hospital,
such as primary care services, and may increase or decrease the percentage of
Medicare or another benchmark as appropriate, first to enhance access to
primary care and later for alignment with the Statewide Health Care Delivery
Strategic Plan established pursuant to section 9403 of this title, once
established. The Board may consider establishing reference-based pricing for
services delivered outside a hospital by setting minimum amounts that shall be
paid for the purpose of prioritizing access to high-quality health care services
in settings that are appropriate to patients’ needs in order to contain costs and
improve patient outcomes.
(6) The Board’s authority to establish reference-based prices pursuant
to this subsection shall not include the authority to set amounts applicable to
items provided or services delivered to patients who are enrolled in Medicare
or Medicaid.
Sec. 3a. 18 V.S.A. § 9451 is amended to read:
