8 expressed in section 9371 of this title.
9 (b) The Board shall have the following duties:
10 (1) Oversee the development and implementation, and evaluate the

1 integrated delivery systems, health care professionals, or other provider
2 arrangements.
3 * * *
4 (5) Set rates for health care professionals pursuant to section 9376 of
5 this title, to be implemented over time beginning with reference-based pricing
6 as soon as practicable, but not later than hospital fiscal year 2027, and make
7 adjustments to the rules on reimbursement methodologies as needed.
8 (6) Approve, modify, or disapprove requests for health insurance rates

3 * * *
4 Sec. 3. 18 V.S.A. § 9376 is amended to read:
5 § 9376. PAYMENT AMOUNTS; METHODS
6 (a) Intent. It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure payments to
7 health care professionals that are consistent with efficiency, economy, and
8 quality of care and will permit them to provide, on a solvent basis, effective
9 and efficient health services that are in the public interest. It is also the intent
10 of the General Assembly to eliminate the shift of costs between the payers of
11 health services to ensure that the amount paid to health care professionals is
12 sufficient to enlist enough providers to ensure that health services are available
13 to all Vermonters and are distributed equitably.
14 (b) Rate-setting.
15 (1) The Board shall set reasonable rates for health care professionals,
16 health care provider bargaining groups created pursuant to section 9409 of this
17 title, manufacturers of prescribed products, medical supply companies, and
18 other companies providing health services or health supplies based on
19 methodologies pursuant to section 9375 of this title, in order to have a
20 consistent reimbursement amount accepted by these persons. In its discretion,
21 the Board may implement rate-setting for different groups of health care
VT LEG #384084 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.126
2025 Page 5 of 44
1 professionals over time and need not set rates for all types of health care
2 professionals. In establishing rates, the Board may consider legitimate
3 differences in costs among health care professionals, such as the cost of
4 providing a specific necessary service or services that may not be available
5 elsewhere in the State, and the need for health care professionals in particular
6 areas of the State, particularly in underserved geographic or practice shortage
7 areas.
8 (2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to:
9 (A) limit the ability of a health care professional to accept less than
10 the rate established in subdivision (1) of this subsection (b) from a patient
11 without health insurance or other coverage for the service or services received;
12 or
13 (B) reduce or limit the covered services offered by Medicare or
14 Medicaid.
15 (c) Methodologies. The Board shall approve payment methodologies that
16 encourage cost-containment; provision of high-quality, evidence-based health
17 services in an integrated setting; patient self-management; access to primary
18 care health services for underserved individuals, populations, and areas; and
19 healthy lifestyles. Such methodologies shall be consistent with payment
20 reform and with evidence-based practices, and may include fee-for-service
21 payments if the Board determines such payments to be appropriate.

1 (d) Supervision. To the extent required to avoid federal antitrust violations
2 and in furtherance of the policy identified in subsection (a) of this section, the
3 Board shall facilitate and supervise the participation of health care
4 professionals and health care provider bargaining groups in the process
5 described in subsection (b) of this section.
6 (e) Reference-based pricing.
7 (1)(A) The Board shall establish reference-based prices that represent
8 the maximum amounts that hospitals shall accept as payment in full for items
9 provided and services delivered in Vermont. The Board may also implement
10 reference-based pricing for services delivered outside a hospital by setting the
11 minimum amounts that shall be paid for items provided and services delivered
12 by nonhospital-based health care professionals. The Board shall consult with
13 health insurers, hospitals, other health care professionals as applicable, the
14 Office of the Health Care Advocate, and the Agency of Human Services in
15 developing reference-based prices pursuant to this subsection (e), including on
16 ways to achieve all-payer alignment on the design and implementation of
17 reference-based pricing.
18 (B) The Board shall implement reference-based pricing in a manner
19 that does not allow health care professionals to charge or collect from patients
20 or health insurers any amount in excess of the reference-based amount
21 established by the Board.
VT LEG #384084 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.126
2025 Page 7 of 44
1 (2)(A) Reference-based prices established pursuant to this subsection (e)
2 shall be based on a percentage of the Medicare reimbursement for the same or
3 a similar item or service or on another benchmark, as appropriate, provided
4 that if the Board establishes prices that are referenced to Medicare, the Board
5 may opt to update the prices in the future based on a reasonable rate of growth
6 that is separate from Medicare rates, such as the Medicare Economic Index
7 measure of inflation, in order to provide predictability and consistency for
8 health care professionals and payers and to protect against federal funding
9 pressures that may impact Medicare rates in an unpredictable manner. The
10 Board may also reference to, and update based on, other payment or pricing
11 systems where appropriate.
12 (B) In establishing reference-based prices for a hospital pursuant to
13 this subsection (e), the Board shall consider the composition of the
14 communities served by the hospital, including the health of the population,
15 demographic characteristics, acuity, payer mix, labor costs, social risk factors,
16 and other factors that may affect the costs of providing care in the hospital
17 service area, as well as the hospital’s role in Vermont’s health care system.
18 (3)(A) The Board shall begin implementing reference-based pricing as
19 soon as practicable but not later than hospital fiscal year 2027 by establishing
20 the maximum amounts that Vermont hospitals shall accept as payment in full
21 for items provided and services delivered. After initial implementation, the
VT LEG #384084 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.126
2025 Page 8 of 44
1 Board shall review the reference-based prices for each hospital annually as part
2 of the hospital budget review process set forth in chapter 221, subchapter 7 of
3 this title.
4 (B) The Board, in collaboration with the Department of Financial
5 Regulation, shall monitor the implementation of reference-based pricing to
6 ensure that any decreases in amounts paid to hospitals also result in decreases
7 in health insurance premiums. The Board shall post its findings regarding the
8 alignment between price decreases and premium decreases annually on its
9 website.
10 (4) The Board shall identify factors that would necessitate terminating
11 or modifying the use of reference-based pricing in one or more hospitals, such
12 as a measurable reduction in access to or quality of care.
13 (5) The Green Mountain Care Board, in consultation with the Agency of
14 Human Services and the Vermont Steering Committee for Comprehensive
15 Primary Health Care established pursuant to section 9403b of this title, may
16 implement reference-based pricing for services delivered outside a hospital,
17 such as primary care services, and may increase or decrease the percentage of
18 Medicare or another benchmark as appropriate, first to enhance access to
19 primary care and later for alignment with the Statewide Health Care Delivery
20 Strategic Plan established pursuant to section 9403 of this title, once
21 established. The Board may consider establishing reference-based pricing for
VT LEG #384084 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.126
2025 Page 9 of 44
1 services delivered outside a hospital by setting minimum amounts that shall be
2 paid for the purpose of prioritizing access to high-quality health care services
3 in settings that are appropriate to patients’ needs in order to contain costs and
4 improve patient outcomes.
5 (6) The Board’s authority to establish reference-based prices pursuant to
6 this subsection shall not include the authority to set amounts applicable to
7 items provided or services delivered to patients who are enrolled in Medicare
8 or Medicaid.
