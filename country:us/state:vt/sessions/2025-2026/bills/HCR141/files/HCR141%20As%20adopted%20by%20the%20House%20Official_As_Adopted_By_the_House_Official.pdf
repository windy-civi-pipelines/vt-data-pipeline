State of Vermont
House of Representatives
Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 141
Offered by Representatives Holcombe of Norwich and Masland of Thetford
House concurrent resolution in memory of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) engineer
Edward M. Hathaway
Whereas, Ed Hathaway graduated from the Xaverian Brothers High School in Westwood,
Massachusetts, and Suffolk University in Boston, Massachusetts, as a business major, and
Whereas, business proved a temporary detour on Ed Hathaway’s life path, as he discovered upon
moving to the Southwest a deep love of nature, prompting him to return to school and earn a degree in
environmental science from Northern Arizona University, and
Whereas, this second degree opened the door for a brilliant 36-year career at the EPA, initially as a
manager in the Superfund Division, and
Whereas, Ed Hathaway’s solid scientific knowledge was only one aspect of his superb public service,
as he was an extraordinary facilitator who could bring conflicting parties, be they community groups,
state, or other federal agencies, to viable solutions when addressing environmental problems, and
Whereas, the EPA valued Ed Hathaway’s professional achievements, and he was repeatedly honored
with agency awards, most recently “Mentor of the Year,” and
Whereas, in Vermont, his enduring legacy was as the supervising EPA engineer for two Vermont
Superfund cleanup projects: at the Ely Copper Mine in Vershire and the Elizabeth Mine in Strafford,
the latter for which he enabled over $100 million to be directed to this challenging project, even
arranging the replacement of roads that heavy truck traffic had damaged, and
Whereas, this truly kind and highly respected official’s EPA role was cut short due to his contracting
pancreatic cancer, which he fought valiantly until his death on March 7, 2025 at 63 years of age, and his
survivors include his wife, Ann-Marie Burke; his sons; and his parents, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly extends its sincere condolences to the family of Edward M. Hathaway,
and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the members of
Ed Hathaway’s family.
