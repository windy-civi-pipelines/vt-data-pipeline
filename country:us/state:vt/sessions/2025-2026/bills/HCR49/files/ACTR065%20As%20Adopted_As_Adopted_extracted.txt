Glaciers in Vermont.
(H.C.R.49)
Offered by Representative Greer of Bennington
Whereas, according to United Nations Resolution 77/158, which the United Nations
General Assembly adopted on December 14, 2022, “glaciers are a critical component of
the hydrological cycle and . . . the current accelerated melting and retreat of glaciers have
severe impacts on the climate, the environment, the maintenance of human well-being
and health and sustainable development,” and
Whereas, the resolution further stated that “in many high mountain areas, glacier
retreat and permafrost thaw are projected to further decrease the stability of slopes, and
that the incidences of floods owing to glacier lake outburst or rain-on-snow, landslides
and snow avalanches are projected to increase and occur in new locations or different
seasons,” and
Whereas, the United Nations General Assembly also expressed “the urgent need to
raise awareness of and to promote and facilitate actions and sustainable measures towards
preserving glaciers,” and
Whereas, the proponents of the resolution believed that the best way for the
international community to focus on these concerns was to “declare 2025 the
International Year of Glaciers’ Preservation and to proclaim 21 March of each year the
World Day for Glaciers,” and
Whereas, the first World Day for Glaciers will be observed on March 21, 2025 and
will include official events at United Nations headquarters in New York City and at
UNESCO headquarters in Paris, featuring glaciologists, policymakers, and the media,
designed to bring public attention to this climate situation, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly recognizes March 21, 2025 as World Day for Glaciers in
Vermont, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the United Nations Secretary-General.
