9 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to appropriate
10 various sums of money to the Agency of Human Services and the Office of the
11 Attorney General to establish and support a State-supported and community-
12 based continuum of care for justice-involved individuals. Specifically, this bill
13 proposes to appropriate monies to fund supportive and transitional housing
14 initiatives and community-based mental health and substance use services, and
15 to reappropriate funds for correctional facility construction to invest in
16 community-based services.
17 An act relating to establishing a State-funded and community-based
18 continuum of care for justice-involved individuals
19 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
20 Sec. 1. FINDINGS
VT LEG #381116 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.456
2025 Page 2 of 11
1 The General Assembly finds that:
2 (1) Social determinants of health and crime are interconnected and
3 impact public health and safety.
4 (2) Housing conditions are a key determinant of both health and crime.
5 The lack of affordable housing contributes to the extended incarceration of
6 justice-involved individuals beyond their minimum sentences in Vermont and
7 is linked to higher recidivism rates. Incarceration itself worsens these
8 conditions, negatively affecting public health and safety.
9 (3) Access to health care is also a social determinant of health and
10 crime. Justice-involved individuals suffer from higher rates of chronic health
11 conditions, infectious diseases, substance use disorders, and mental illness. A
12 public health approach focused on prevention and addressing these shared
13 determinants is essential for improving health and reducing crime.
14 (4) Education is a critical social determinant of both health and crime.
15 (5) Economic and social opportunities also drive both health outcomes
16 and criminal behavior.
17 (6) Incarceration often exacerbates social and economic harm and fails
18 to effectively rehabilitate individuals.
19 (7) Vermont can reduce criminal behavior by investing in housing,
20 education, workforce development, health care, nutrition, and mental health

3 Sec. 2. INTENT AND PURPOSE
4 (a) Intent.
5 (1) It is the intent of the General Assembly to reduce harm, restore
6 justice, promote recovery, and build resilience by delaying the construction of
7 new correctional facilities and prioritizing investments in social and housing
8 infrastructure.
9 (2) It is further the intent of the General Assembly to promote
10 transformative justice and recovery by providing housing and shelter for
11 justice-involved individuals alongside community-based support services.
12 (b) Purpose. The purpose of this act is to transform Vermontâ€™s criminal
13 justice system by reducing reliance on State-funded correctional facilities. The
14 act seeks to establish a community-based system of care and rehabilitation that
15 reduces recidivism and promotes recovery. The system will include:
16 (1) accessible, equitable, and localized services statewide;
17 (2) secure housing for individuals in recovery and those at risk of self-
18 harm or harming others;
19 (3) strengthened treatment, education, and workforce training integrated
20 into localized, equitable residential programs;
