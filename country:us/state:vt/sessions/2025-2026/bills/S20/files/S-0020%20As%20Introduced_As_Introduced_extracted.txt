12 licensed beds of a health care facility through addition or conversion, or
13 through relocation from one physical facility or site to another.
14 (5) The offering of any home health service.
15 (c) In the case of a project that requires a certificate of need under this
16 section, expenditures for which are anticipated to be in excess of
17 $30,000,000.00 $50,000,000.00, the applicant first shall secure a conceptual
18 development phase certificate of need, in accordance with the standards and
19 procedures established in this subchapter, that permits the applicant to make
20 expenditures for architectural services, engineering design services, or any
21 other planning services, as defined by the Board, needed in connection with the

2 and before offering or further developing the project, the applicant shall secure
3 a final certificate of need in accordance with the standards and procedures
4 established in this subchapter. Applicants shall not be subject to sanctions for
5 failure to comply with the provisions of this subsection if such failure is solely
6 the result of good faith reliance on verified project cost estimates issued by
7 qualified persons, which cost estimates would have led a reasonable person to
8 conclude the project was not anticipated to be in excess of $30,000,000.00
9 $50,000,000.00 and therefore not subject to this subsection. The provisions of
10 this subsection notwithstanding, expenditures may be made in preparation for

16 order to avoid cost thresholds or other requirements under this subchapter, the
17 person shall be required to submit an application for a certificate of need for
18 the entire project, and the Board may proceed under section 9445 of this title.
19 The Board’s determination under this subsection shall have the effect of a final
20 decision and is subject to appeal under section 9381 of this title.
