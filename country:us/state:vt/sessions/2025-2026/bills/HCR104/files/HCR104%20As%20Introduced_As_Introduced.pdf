State of Vermont
House of Representatives
Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 104
Offered by Committee on Human Services
House concurrent resolution recognizing May 2025 as National Foster Care Month in Vermont
Whereas, according to the U.S. Child Welfare Information Gateway, there are over 365,000 children
and youth in foster care, and “77 percent of eligible youth in foster care, ages 14–21 years old, left care
without receiving the federally funded services necessary to prepare them for adulthood and
independent living,” and
Whereas, the Department for Children and Families reports that as of April 1, 2025, 868 Vermont
children were in foster care, there were 820 licensed foster caregivers and 174 caregiver licenses were
pending, and approximately 35 percent of foster caregivers were family members or close friends who
voluntarily secured foster care licensure, and
Whereas, on May 10, 1988, at the initiative of the U.S. Children’s Bureau, President Ronald Reagan
signed Proclamation 5820 establishing Foster Care Month, which continues to be observed annually to
direct the public’s attention to the nation’s system of foster care, and
Whereas, Proclamation 5820 acknowledged that “the family has the prime responsibility for
nurturing children…[but] some parents are unable to provide a minimally acceptable level of care for
their children, and temporary or permanent alternative placement is necessary…[and that] foster care
must… [focus] on the well-being of the child,” and
Whereas, the 2025 theme for National Foster Care Month is “Engaging Youth. Building Supports.
Strengthening Opportunities.” — a theme that “highlights the need to create a child welfare system that
authentically engages and supports young people who are preparing to leave foster care,” a current topic
of great concern in the foster care community, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly recognizes May 2025 as National Foster Care Month in Vermont, and be
it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the System of
Care Unit Director at the Department for Children and Families’ Family Services Division.
