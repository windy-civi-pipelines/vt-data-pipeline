Hornets Division I boys’ indoor track and field team on winning a second consecutive
Division I championship.
(H.C.R.45)
Offered by Representatives Dodge of Essex, Black of Essex, Dolan of Essex Junction,
Garofano of Essex, Houghton of Essex Junction, and Steady of Milton
Whereas, the stellar reputation of Essex’s boys’ indoor track and field team is
reflected in its impressive pre-2025 record of four championship titles since 2019 and 12
in the program’s history, and
Whereas, this winter’s championship meet, held at the University of Vermont, proved
a golden opportunity for the Hornets, as a team member won the 55-meter dash (6.65),
set a State boys’ record in the 55-meter hurdles (7.50), and placed first in the long jump
(20’ 4”), the shot put (57’ 10”), and the weight throw (56’ 4.25”); and when all the
competitive events had concluded, the Hornets had won the day, outscoring second-place
St. Johnsbury Academy 130–112, and
Whereas, the victorious Hornets athletes were Skyler Ackerman-Demers, Paxton
Bartlett-Brown, Liam Beckett, Brady Botelho, Rory Callahan, Matthew Chiarella, Eli
Conti, Carter Crete, Samuel Curtiss, Henry Dimitroff, Roland Ekstrom, Jack Gorman,
Sanjin Hadzic, Evan Hughes, Zachary Jackman, Alexander Johnson, Maxwell Lesny,
Gregory Maiberger, Diwash Maidali, Emilio Mattos-Canedo, Alexander McClary,
Jonathan McNamara, Thomas Meek, Kymani Mignott, Mason Newell, Adam Niquette,
Aidan Nourse, Mason Pea, Joseph Reed, Charles Roy, Asher St. Pierre, James Steward,
Beckett Versluys, Isaac Wargo, and William White, and
Whereas, Head Coach Nicholas Smith and assistant coaches Adam Lacross, Julie
McGilpin, Varpilah Chase, Phil Reynolds, and Toki Tierata were proud of the team’s
achievements, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2025 Essex High School Hornets
Division I boys’ indoor track and field team on winning a second consecutive Division I
championship, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
