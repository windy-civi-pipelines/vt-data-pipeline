management, including recycling, energy recovery, and disposal, using
environmentally sound management practices.
(4) Describe the Program and how it will provide for convenient and
available statewide collection of postconsumer architectural paint products in
urban and rural areas of the State. The producer or stewardship organization
shall use the existing household hazardous waste collection infrastructure when
selecting collection points for postconsumer architectural paint products. A
paint retailer shall be authorized as a paint collection point of postconsumer
architectural paint for a Paint Product Stewardship Program if the paint retailer
volunteers to act as a paint collection point and complies with all applicable
laws, rules, and regulations.
(5) Provide geographic information modeling to determine the number
and distribution of sites for collection of postconsumer architectural paint
based on the following criteria:
(A) at least 90 percent of Vermont residents shall have a permanent
collection site within a 15-mile radius; and

10,000 residents of a municipality and additional sites shall be distributed to
provide convenient and reasonably equitable access for residents within each
municipality, unless otherwise approved by the Secretary.
(6) Establish goals to reduce the generation of postconsumer paint
products, to promote the reuse of postconsumer paint products, and for the
proper management of postconsumer paint products as practical based on
current household hazardous waste program information. The goals may be
revised by the producer or stewardship organization based on the information
collected for the annual report.

the waste-management hierarchy. The management of paint under the
Program shall use management activities that promote source reduction, reuse,

§ 6673. PAINT PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM
(a) A producer or a stewardship organization representing producers shall
submit a an amended plan for the establishment of a Paint Product
Stewardship Program to the Secretary for approval by December 1, 2013. The
plan shall address the following:

(1) Provide a list of participating producers and brands covered by the
Program.
(2) Provide specific information on the architectural paint products
covered under the Program, such as interior or exterior water- and oil-based
coatings, primers, sealers, or wood coatings.
(3) Describe how the Program proposed under the plan will collect,
transport, recycle, and process postconsumer paint products for end-of-life
management, including recycling, energy recovery, and disposal, using
environmentally sound management practices.
(4) Describe the Program and how it will provide for convenient and
available statewide collection of postconsumer architectural paint products in
urban and rural areas of the State. The producer or stewardship organization
shall use the existing household hazardous waste collection infrastructure when
selecting collection points for postconsumer architectural paint products. A
paint retailer shall be authorized as a paint collection point of postconsumer
architectural paint for a Paint Product Stewardship Program if the paint retailer
volunteers to act as a paint collection point and complies with all applicable
laws, rules, and regulations.
(5) Provide geographic information modeling to determine the number
and distribution of sites for collection of postconsumer architectural paint
based on the following criteria:
(A) at least 90 percent of Vermont residents shall have a permanent
collection site within a 15-mile radius; and
(B) one additional permanent site will be established for every
10,000 residents of a municipality and additional sites shall be distributed to
provide convenient and reasonably equitable access for residents within each
municipality, unless otherwise approved by the Secretary.
(6) Establish goals to reduce the generation of postconsumer paint
products, to promote the reuse of postconsumer paint products, and for the
proper management of postconsumer paint products as practical based on
current household hazardous waste program information. The goals may be
revised by the producer or stewardship organization based on the information
collected for the annual report.
(7) Describe how postconsumer paint products will be managed in the
most environmentally and economically sound manner, including following
the waste-management hierarchy. The management of paint under the
Program shall use management activities that promote source reduction, reuse,
recycling, energy recovery, and disposal.
(8) Describe education and outreach efforts to inform consumers of
collection opportunities for postconsumer paint products and to promote the

source reduction and recycling of architectural paint products for each of the
following: consumers, contractors, and retailers.
(b) The producer or stewardship organization shall submit a budget for the
Program proposed under subsection (a) of this section, and for any amendment
to the plan that would affect the Program’s costs. The budget shall include a

remits to a stewardship organization payment of a paint product stewardship
assessment for each container of architectural paint product it sells in this
State. Prior to submitting the proposed budget and assessment to the
Secretary, the producer or stewardship organization shall provide the budget
and assessment to a third-party auditor agreed upon by the Secretary. The
third-party auditor shall provide a recommendation as to whether the proposed
budget and assessment is cost-effective, reasonable, and limited to covering the
cost of the Program. The paint product stewardship assessment shall be added
to the cost of all architectural paint products sold in Vermont. To ensure that
the funding mechanism is equitable and sustainable, a uniform paint product
stewardship assessment shall be established for all architectural paint products
sold. The paint stewardship assessment shall be approved by the Secretary and

Program the amount established in section 6681 of this title.

member shall implement the approved plan for a Paint Product Stewardship
Program.
(d) A producer or a stewardship organization of which a producer is a
member shall promote a Paint Product Stewardship Program and provide
consumers with educational and informational materials describing collection
opportunities for postconsumer paint products Statewide and promotion of
waste prevention, reuse, and recycling. The educational and informational
program shall make consumers aware that the funding for the operation of the
Paint Product Stewardship Program has been added to the purchase price of all
architectural paint products sold in the State.
(e) A plan approved under this section shall provide for collection of
postconsumer architectural paint at no cost to the person from whom the
architectural paint product is collected. The program plan also shall provide
for the payment of municipalities for collection, processing, and end-of-life
management of aerosol coating products, coating-related products, and
nonindustrial coatings contained in the receptacle in which the product is
offered for retail sale. Collection costs include facility costs, equipment costs,
labor, supplies, maintenance, events costs, and event contractor costs,

including collection event set-up fees, environmental service fees, insurance
fees, and shipping containers and materials.

section, the Secretary shall make the proposed plan or amendment available
for public review and comment for at least 30 days.

(1) a change to a paint stewardship assessment under the plan;
(2) an addition to or removal of a category of products covered under
the Program; or
(3)(2) a revision of the product stewardship organization’s goals.
(h) A plan approved by the Secretary under section 6675 of this title shall
have a term not to exceed five years, provided that the producer remains in
compliance with the requirements of this chapter and the terms of the
approved plan.
(i) In addition to the requirements specified in subsection (a) of this
section, a stewardship organization shall notify the Secretary in writing within
30 days of after any change to:

the fee required by 3 V.S.A. § 2822(j)(31) annually by on or before July 1 of
each year.
