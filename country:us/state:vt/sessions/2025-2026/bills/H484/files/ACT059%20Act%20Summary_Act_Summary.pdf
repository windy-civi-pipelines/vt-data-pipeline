Act No. 59 (H.484). An act relating to miscellaneous agricultural subjects
Subjects: Agriculture; fertilizer; beneficial substances; waste pesticide collection;
covered house hazardous products; paint products; miscellaneous subjects
This act amends multiple laws related to agricultural or environmental subjects. The
act amends current statute related to regulation of fertilizers, plant amendments, and soil
amendments to conform State law to national standards for beneficial substances. The
act also increases the annual pesticide product registration fee by $50.00. The revenue
from the increased fee will be used to pay the costs of a collection program for obsolete
and unwanted pesticides. In addition, the Secretary of Agriculture, Food and Markets is
required to study options for sustainable funding sources to reimburse solid waste
management entities for all costs associated with collection and disposal of unwanted or
obsolete pesticides and shall recommend to the General Assembly a funding mechanism
to cover all costs associated with collecting unwanted pesticides through municipal
collection programs.
The act provides that the Rutland County Agricultural Society, Inc. (State Fair) shall
continue to be required to obtain the three-acre stormwater operating permit, but the State
Fair shall not be required to pay a stormwater impact fee or complete an offset for those
reductions it cannot complete because of site constraints. The act also provides that the
Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation rule entitled “Intent to Cut Notification
Emergency Rules, Standards and Procedures” shall be deemed to have continued in full
force and effect and remained valid on and after July 1, 2018, despite not being published
in the Vermont Code of Rules as of July 1, 2018.
The act amends the Household Hazardous Waste Producer Responsibility Program to
clarify that it does not include paint products. The act amends the Program to allow the
stewardship organization additional time to implement a collection plan that meets the
minimum requirements. The act provides that if the stewardship organization does not
submit an approvable plan, the Agency of Natural Resources (ANR) may issue a plan and
charge the manufacturers of covered household hazardous products for the cost of the
program, plus a penalty. The act also extends the date of the landfill disposal ban on
covered household hazardous products by a year and provides ANR with authority to
grant variances to the requirements for municipal household hazardous waste collection
events.
The act amends the existing extended producer responsibility (EPR) program for
architectural paint to expand its scope to include paint products, which includes aerosol
coating products, coating related products, and nonindustrial coatings. The scope of the
program was expanded to clarify that the EPR program for paint and not the EPR
program for covered household hazardous products is responsible for the collection and
management of the expanded list of paint products. The act also repeals the authority of
VT LEG #384123 v.2

efficiency project at the baseload power plant.
