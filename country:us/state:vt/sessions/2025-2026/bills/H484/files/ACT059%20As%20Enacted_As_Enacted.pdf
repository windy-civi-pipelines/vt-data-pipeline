management, including recycling, energy recovery, and disposal, using
environmentally sound management practices.

(4) Describe the Program and how it will provide for convenient and
available statewide collection of postconsumer architectural paint products in
urban and rural areas of the State. The producer or stewardship organization
shall use the existing household hazardous waste collection infrastructure when
selecting collection points for postconsumer architectural paint products. A
paint retailer shall be authorized as a paint collection point of postconsumer
architectural paint for a Paint Product Stewardship Program if the paint retailer
volunteers to act as a paint collection point and complies with all applicable
laws, rules, and regulations.
(5) Provide geographic information modeling to determine the number
and distribution of sites for collection of postconsumer architectural paint
based on the following criteria:
(A) at least 90 percent of Vermont residents shall have a permanent
collection site within a 15-mile radius; and
(B) one additional permanent site will be established for every
10,000 residents of a municipality and additional sites shall be distributed to
provide convenient and reasonably equitable access for residents within each
municipality, unless otherwise approved by the Secretary.
(6) Establish goals to reduce the generation of postconsumer paint
products, to promote the reuse of postconsumer paint products, and for the

most environmentally and economically sound manner, including following
the waste-management hierarchy. The management of paint under the
Program shall use management activities that promote source reduction, reuse,
