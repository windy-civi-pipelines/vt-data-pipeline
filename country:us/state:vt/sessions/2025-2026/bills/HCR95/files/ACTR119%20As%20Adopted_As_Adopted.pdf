No. R-119. House concurrent resolution designating April 24, 2025 as Vermont
Children’s Alliance Day at the State House.
(H.C.R.95)
Offered by Representative Noyes of Wolcott
Whereas, in Vermont, there are 13 Child Advocacy Centers (CACs) focusing on the
challenges and solutions to the continuing prevalence of child abuse in our State, and
Whereas, these important organizations provide critical support and representational
services to children whose needs can be acute and who rely on the centers to assist in
transforming their lives from ones that may be harsh to a potentially more promising
future, and
Whereas, a CAC provides “forensic interviews, a safe meeting space, victim
advocacy, and coordinated care to children that report sexual and physical abuse,” and
Whereas, “the vision of the Vermont Children’s Alliance (VCA) [the CACs’
membership organization] is to empower Vermont’s CACs to provide equal and reliable
access to support, treatment, justice, and healing for every child,” and
Whereas, this vision is encompassed in the organization’s mission “to foster the
growth of the CAC movement by providing statewide support and resources, promoting
awareness of child abuse and its impact on our communities,” and
Whereas, today, April 24, 2025, representatives of the VCA and its member CACs are
visiting the State House to educate legislators on the importance of addressing the
continuing problems associated with the abuse of our youngest Vermonters, now
therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly designates April 24, 2025 as Vermont Children’s Alliance
Day at the State House, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the Vermont Children’s Alliance.
