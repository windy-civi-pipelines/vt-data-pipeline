1 H.482
2 Introduced by Committee on Health Care
3 Date:
4 Subject: Health; hospitals; health insurers; Green Mountain Care Board;
5 hospital observer
6 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to authorize the
7 Green Mountain Care Board to reduce a health insurer’s reimbursement rates
8 to one or more hospitals if the health insurer is at imminent risk of insolvency.
9 The bill would permit the Board to reduce a hospital’s budget for the
10 forthcoming fiscal year to account for the hospital’s budget overage in the
11 previous fiscal year. The bill would also allow the Board to appoint an
12 independent observer to oversee a hospital and its operations if the Board finds
13 the hospital has made a material misrepresentation or is out of compliance with
14 its budget and the Board believes that appointing an independent observer is in
15 the public interest.
16 An act relating to Green Mountain Care Board authority to adjust a
17 hospital’s reimbursement rates and to appoint a hospital observer
18 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
19 Sec. 1. 18 V.S.A. § 9384 is added to read:

9 hospitals deliver health care services in a coordinated manner using an
10 integrated financial and governance structure.
11 (b) If the Green Mountain Care Board determines, after consultation with
12 the Commissioner of Financial Regulation, that a domestic health insurer faces
13 an acute and immediate threat to its solvency because its risk-based capital
14 level has triggered a regulatory action level event pursuant to 8 V.S.A. § 8304,
15 the Board may order a reduction of the insurer’s reimbursement rates to one or
16 more Vermont hospitals as set forth in subsection (c) of this section until such

18 action level risk-based capital threshold defined in 8 V.S.A. § 8301.

7 hospital pursuant to this subsection only to the extent necessary to remediate
8 the threat to the domestic health insurer’s solvency.
9 (3) In no event shall a reduction ordered by the Board pursuant to this
10 section result in a decrease to a hospital’s or hospital network’s projected days’
11 cash on hand to below 125 days.
