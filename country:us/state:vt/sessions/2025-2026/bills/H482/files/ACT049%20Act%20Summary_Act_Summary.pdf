Act No. 49 (H.482). An act relating to Green Mountain Care Board authority to adjust a
hospital’s reimbursement rates and to appoint a hospital observer
Subjects: Health; Green Mountain Care Board; hospitals; health insurers; hospital
observer
This act allows the Green Mountain Care Board (GMCB) to reduce a domestic health
insurer’s reimbursement rates to one or more Vermont hospitals if the insurer is facing an
acute and immediate threat of insolvency. The GMCB may only reduce rates to a
hospital that meets certain fiscal criteria and only to the extent necessary to address the
threat to the insurer’s insolvency. The act directs the GMCB, in setting hospital budgets,
to account for any significant deviation in a hospital’s revenue during the prior fiscal year
in excess of the budget approved by GMCB and allows the GMCB to adjust a hospital’s
commercial health insurance reimbursement rates at any time during the year to ensure
that a hospital stays within its approved budget. The act also allows the GMCB, upon
finding that a hospital has made a material misrepresentation in information or documents
it provided to GMCB, or is materially noncompliant with its approved budget, to appoint
an independent observer for the hospital. The observer may monitor the hospital’s
operations, obtain information from the hospital, and report findings and
recommendations to the GMCB, and the GMCB may order a hospital to pay for all or a
portion of the costs of the observer. The GMCB’s authority to appoint a hospital
observer is repealed on January 1, 2030.
