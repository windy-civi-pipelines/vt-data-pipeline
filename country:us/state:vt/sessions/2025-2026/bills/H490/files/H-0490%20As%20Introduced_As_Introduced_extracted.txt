11 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to reduce the
12 community service hours a person convicted of a second impaired driving
13 offense is required to complete under 23 V.S.A. § 1210(c). The bill would
14 contain a findings section stating that aligning these time requirements is
15 consistent with the State’s Restorative Justice Policy established pursuant to 28
16 V.S.A. § 2a because it would encourage more people to elect community
17 service over incarceration for offenses where community service exists as a
18 sentencing alternative. The bill’s findings section would also reference the
19 latest Department of Corrections’ figures for persons residing at Vermont
20 correctional facilities as the starting measure of any reduction that the bill’s
21 initiative may have on the number of persons incarcerated in Vermont.
