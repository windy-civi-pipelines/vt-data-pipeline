Act No. 4 (H.2). An act relating to increasing the minimum age for delinquency
proceedings
Subjects: Delinquency proceedings; minimum age
This act increases from 10 to 12 the minimum age for a child to be subject to
delinquency proceedings. The act extends the implementation date for the Raise the Age
juvenile justice initiative from April 1, 2025 to July 1, 2027. This program, which has
been ongoing for several years, increases the age at which children who engage in
criminal conduct are charged as juveniles in the Family Division rather than as adults in
the Criminal Division. The act also requires the Department for Children and Families to
provide the Legislature with two status reports on the programâ€™s implementation.
