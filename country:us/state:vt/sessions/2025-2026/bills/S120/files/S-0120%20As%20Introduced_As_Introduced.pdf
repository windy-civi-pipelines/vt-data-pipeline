1 personal drug use and to distribute grants from the Community Care, Health,
2 and Safety Special Fund.
3 An act relating to funding support services for persons who use drugs and
4 eliminating misdemeanor criminal penalties for possessing or dispensing a
5 personal use drug supply
6 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
7 Sec. 1. FINDINGS
8 The General Assembly finds that:
9 (1) Fatal and nonfatal drug overdoses in Vermont are an urgent public
10 health crisis, with rates of overdose deaths rising sharply in recent years. Drug
11 overdose reportedly killed 264 Vermonters in 2022 and drug toxicity deaths
12 have increased by over 500 percent since 2010.
13 (2) Nonfatal opioid overdose emergency department visits have also
14 been increasing. From 2018 to 2021, 1,631 individuals visited an emergency
15 department for an opioid overdose.
16 (3) Research has consistently shown that public health strategies are
17 effective at reducing overdose deaths, reducing the transmission of infectious
18 diseases, and improving health outcomes for individuals who use drugs.
19 (4) Investments in criminal justice approaches have proven ineffective
20 in reducing overdose. Despite more than 10,000 arrests for drug possession
VT LEG #380022 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.120
2025 Page 3 of 40
1 offenses since 2010, fatal drug overdoses have continued to rise during this
2 period.
3 (5) The medical and public understanding that addiction is a chronic
4 brain disease has increased in recent years, yet Vermont’s laws have continued
5 to reflect a punitive criminal justice model that has been ineffective in
6 improving public health and has itself caused extensive harm.
7 (6) The criminalization of drug use has profoundly negative impacts on
8 individuals, families, and communities. The stigma of a criminal arrest or
9 conviction often results in detrimental physical, psychological, and economic
10 impacts on the lives of those arrested. Involvement in the criminal legal
11 system can interfere with employment, housing, educational opportunities, and
12 professional licensing and lead to burdensome debt from fines. According to a
13 2020 report by the Brennan Center for Justice, individuals convicted of a
14 misdemeanor have their annual earnings reduced by an average of 16 percent.
15 (7) Studies have also repeatedly found that periods of incarceration
16 substantially increase the risk of fatal overdose. Within the first two weeks of
17 release from incarceration, an individual is substantially more likely to die
18 from a fatal overdose than a person who was not detained.
19 (8) Criminalizing drug use and possession reduces the amount of
20 resources available for harm reduction and treatment services, deters
21 individuals from accessing available services due to fear of arrest, and
VT LEG #380022 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.120
2025 Page 4 of 40
1 compounds the social barriers and traumas often contributing to substance use
2 disorder. Arrests and prosecutions can further traumatize individuals who
3 were previously experiencing pain or suffering from prior traumatic events or
4 circumstances.
5 (9) Enforcement of the drug laws in Vermont, as well as nationally, falls
6 disproportionately on persons of color despite similar rates in usage and sale of
7 drugs. Prior to Vermont’s legalization of cannabis in 2018, Black persons
8 were six times more likely to be arrested for cannabis possession than White
9 persons. A 2021 study conducted by the Council of State Governments found
10 that between 2014 and 2019, Black persons in Vermont were 14 times more
11 likely than White persons to be defendants in a felony drug case and
12 18 percentage points more likely than White persons to be sentenced to
13 incarceration for a felony drug offense.
14 (10) A health-based approach to drugs, prioritizing the expansion of
15 harm reduction services and on-demand access to evidence-based treatment,
16 rather than the traditional criminal justice model, has proven to be more
17 effective at preventing opioid deaths and drug-related injuries, reducing the
18 spread of HIV and Hepatitis C and improving health outcomes for persons who
19 use drugs. In particular, harm reduction interventions such as drug-checking
20 services and overdose prevention centers have been implemented throughout
21 the world with demonstrated success in saving lives, providing greater stability
VT LEG #380022 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.120
2025 Page 5 of 40
1 and facilitating access to health care and services for participants, while also
2 significantly benefitting surrounding communities.
3 (11) Harm reduction services, including overdose prevention centers and
4 drug-checking programs, have been shown to be highly effective in reducing
5 the risk that a drug overdose will become fatal and in improving health
6 outcomes for participants.
7 (12) Throughout the last decade in Vermont, the approach to drugs has
8 gradually shifted toward policies focused on prevention, treatment, and harm
9 reduction rather than punishment. In recent years, the General Assembly has
10 enacted legislation decriminalizing possession of the opiate disorder treatment
11 drug buprenorphine, granting immunity from prosecution for possession of
12 drugs for a person who seeks assistance for themselves or another who is
13 experiencing an overdose, supporting the establishment of drug-checking
14 services, authorizing and appropriating funds for overdose prevention centers,
15 providing widespread access to naloxone to treat opiate overdoses in an
16 emergency, and supporting other harm reduction interventions such as syringe
17 service programs.
18 (13) Eliminating criminal penalties for possessing personal use amounts
19 of regulated drugs would continue this progress in shifting toward a fully
20 public-health approach to drug use and addiction by helping eliminate barriers
21 for those who need supportive services. The elimination of criminal penalties
VT LEG #380022 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.120
2025 Page 6 of 40
1 removes the fear of arrest, which drives many individuals to hide their
2 substance use, consume drugs alone in dangerous circumstances, and avoid
3 seeking help from health care systems and harm reduction providers. Such a
4 strategic shift will also allow Vermont to redirect money and resources from
5 prosecution and incarceration toward prevention, harm reduction strategies,
6 and addiction services, affording better outcomes for all Vermonters.
