Bennington, and Pinsonault of Dorset
Offered by Senators Bongartz and Plunkett
Whereas, K-9 police officers serve a unique and essential law enforcement role, and this fact has
been especially reflected in the operations of the Bennington Police Department, where K-9 Gracie was
a star of much renown, serving in a program that Bennington Police Chief Paul J. Doucette Jr. and
Lt. Camillo A. Grande established, and
Whereas, the achievements of this dedicated police officer were undeniably impressive as
enumerated in her over 500 deployments and location of more than 70 persons, and she mightily
contributed to the recovery of drugs and currency valued in excess of $1.6 million, and
Whereas, her service on behalf of the Bennington citizenry was widely respected, and this stalwart
police officer was a welcomed visitor at local schools and was present at many community events, and
Whereas, her sudden death on Thanksgiving Day, November 28, 2024, shocked and saddened
Benningtonians, and
Whereas, her memorial service, with more than 500 persons in attendance, served as a dignified and
emotional farewell featuring the participation of many fans and admirers; a choral musical performance;
the presentation of a tribute American flag to Gracie’s human caretaker, Officer Robert Murawski; and
concluded with a much-befitting 21-gun salute, and
Whereas, a new K-9 training yard, to be constructed in Bennington, will be dedicated in K-9 Gracie’s
honor, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly extends its condolences to the Bennington Police Department and the
many admirers of K-9 Gracie on the death of this outstanding police officer, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the Bennington
Police Department, Police Chief Paul J. Doucette Jr., Lt. Camillo A. Grande, and Officer Robert
Murawski.
