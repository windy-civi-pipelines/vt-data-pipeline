Police Officer Gracie.
(H.C.R.11)
Offered by Representatives Morrissey of Bennington, Cooper of Pownal, Corcoran of

Whereas, K-9 police officers serve a unique and essential law enforcement role, and
this fact has been especially reflected in the operations of the Bennington Police
Department, where K-9 Gracie was a star of much renown, serving in a program that
Bennington Police Chief Paul J. Doucette Jr. and Lt. Camillo A. Grande established, and
Whereas, the achievements of this dedicated police officer were undeniably
impressive as enumerated in her over 500 deployments and location of more than 70
persons, and she mightily contributed to the recovery of drugs and currency valued in
excess of $1.6 million, and
Whereas, her service on behalf of the Bennington citizenry was widely respected, and
this stalwart police officer was a welcomed visitor at local schools and was present at
many community events, and
Whereas, her sudden death on Thanksgiving Day, November 28, 2024, shocked and
saddened Benningtonians, and
Whereas, her memorial service, with more than 500 persons in attendance, served as a
dignified and emotional farewell featuring the participation of many fans and admirers; a
choral musical performance; the presentation of a tribute American flag to Gracie’s
human caretaker, Officer Robert Murawski; and concluded with a much-befitting 21-gun
salute, and
Whereas, a new K-9 training yard, to be constructed in Bennington, will be dedicated
in K-9 Gracie’s honor, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly extends its condolences to the Bennington Police
Department and the many admirers of K-9 Gracie on the death of this outstanding police
officer, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the Bennington Police Department, Police Chief Paul J. Doucette Jr., Lt. Camillo A.
Grande, and Officer Robert Murawski.
