1 (b) After assessing the data collected under subsection (a) of this section,
2 the Commissioner shall establish a minimum hourly insurance reimbursement
3 rate for labor that applies to both first- and third-party automobile insurance
4 claims. The rate shall be a fair and reasonable amount that takes into
5 consideration prevailing competitive prices. In addition, the Commissioner
6 shall establish a formula for annually adjusting the minimum labor rate based
7 on the Consumer Price Index published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor and
8 Statistics.
9 (c) The minimum reimbursement rate established under subsection (b) of
10 this section shall apply to all insurance claims filed on or after January 1, 2026.
11 (d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a claimant and an
12 insurer from negotiating a higher labor rate that takes into consideration factors
13 such as vehicle type; body composition materials; labor type; required labor
14 expertise, training, and certifications; equipment; and geographic area of the
15 chosen repair shop. An insurer shall not refuse to negotiate on the basis of its
16 ability to obtain a price that it can secure from another licensed repair facility
17 conveniently located to the claimant.
18 Sec. 2. EFFECTIVE DATE
19 This act shall take effect on passage.
