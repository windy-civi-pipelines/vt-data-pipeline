Offered by Representative Sibilia of Dover
Offered by Senators Harrison and Hashim
Whereas, in the Town of Jamaica, there is hardly a facet of life that has not greatly
benefited from the participation of Clara Robinson, and
Whereas, being the mother of six children would, for many, be a job leaving no time
for any other role, for Clara Robinson, her family duties were merely one aspect of an
extraordinary life, and
Whereas, municipally, she has served in numerous elected or appointed positions,
including justice of the peace, library trustee, planning commission member, and on the
selectboard, and
Whereas, Clara Robinson’s deep concern for the well-being of the area’s youth has
manifested itself in her employment as a paraprofessional at the Jamaica Village School,
and separately as a member of its school board, as a Windham County Family Court
guardian ad litem, and as a longtime leader of the Jamaica Youth Group, and beyond
these official responsibilities she has always looked out for children and tried to find
ways to make a positive difference in their lives and those of their families, and
Whereas, the parishioners at the Jamaica Community Church have cherished Clara
Robinson as an active member and appreciated her many contributions to church
governance as a trustee, and
Whereas, at Valley Cares (now known as Valley Village), her volunteering with the
exercise program and other activities has been most welcomed, and
Whereas, throughout the Town of Jamaica, Clara Robinson is known as a good friend
and special member of the community who has always been one of the first individuals to
jump in and volunteer for any activity or event, and her decades of devoted public sector,
nonprofit, and religious service have been beyond the call of duty, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly honors dedicated Jamaica community leader and volunteer
Clara Robinson, and be it further
Resolved: That Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Clara Robinson and to the Jamaica Town Clerk.
