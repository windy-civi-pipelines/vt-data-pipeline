Concurrent House Resolution

Offered by Representative Sibilia of Dover
Offered by Senators Harrison and Hashim
Whereas, in the Town of Jamaica, there is hardly a facet of life that has not greatly benefited from the
participation of Clara Robinson, and
Whereas, being the mother of sixchildren would, for many, be a job leaving no time for any other role, for
Clara Robinson, her family duties were merely one aspect of an extraordinary life, and
Whereas, municipally, she has served in numerous elected or appointed positions, including justice of the
peace, library trustee, planning commission member, and on the selectboard, and
Whereas, Clara Robinson’s deep concern for the well-being of the area’s youth has manifested itself in her
employment as a paraprofessional at the Jamaica Village School, and separately as a member of its school
board, as a Windham County Family Court guardian ad litem, and as a longtime leader of the Jamaica Youth
Group, and beyond these official responsibilities she has always looked out for children and tried to find ways
to make a positive difference in their lives and those of their families, and
Whereas, the parishioners at the Jamaica Community Church have cherished Clara Robinson as an active
member and appreciated her many contributions to church governance as a trustee, and
Whereas, at Valley Cares (now known as Valley Village), her volunteering with the exercise program and
other activities has been most welcomed, and
Whereas, throughout the Town of Jamaica, Clara Robinson is known as a good friend and special member of
the community who has always been one of the first individuals to jump in and volunteer for any activity or
event, and her decades of devoted public sector, nonprofit, and religious service have been beyond the call of
duty, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly honors dedicated Jamaica community leader and volunteer Clara Robinson, and
be it further
Resolved: That Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to Clara Robinson and to the
Jamaica Town Clerk.
