(b) All MFOs and LFOs shall maintain documentation of a nutrient
management plan and practices on site or at a nearby office and make the
documentation readily available to the Secretary upon request.
(c) The presumption in 6 V.S.A. § 4810(b) that farms in compliance with
the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets’ Required Agricultural Practices
Rule are not discharging is not applicable to any AFO determined by the
Secretary’s decision to be a CAFO.
Sec. 9. COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDER GROUP ON AGRICULTURAL
WATER QUALITY
(a) On or before December 1, 2025, the Secretary of Natural Resources, in
coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, Food and Markets, shall
engage key stakeholder regarding the implementation and transition to a
Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO) program that conforms with
the Clean Water Act. The process also shall include public notice and
informational hearings to provide updates on the CAFO program and gather
broad public input. The stakeholder engagement process shall include
opportunities for the following stakeholders to provide input: the agricultural
community, including livestock farmers; farm groups; agricultural consultants;
and the environmental community, including watershed groups and water
quality experts. The Secretary shall solicit input from stakeholders on:
(1) the establishment of a CAFO permitting program administered by
the Secretary of Natural Resources that ensures compliance with the Clean
Water Act’s requirement that no farm discharges in violation of the Clean
Water Act’s CAFO permit requirements;
(2) how to align the CAFO program most effectively with water quality
programs administered by the Secretary of Agriculture, Food, and Markets;
(3) how to best create regulatory clarity for agricultural producers for
the long term that is consistent with the Clean Water Act, whether within a
two-agency regulatory system or through a full transfer of regulatory authority
to the Agency of Natural Resources;
(4) the resources, technical assistance, and regulatory structure
necessary to create a path to compliance for agricultural producers that
maintain CAFOs, AFOs, and other farms; and
(5) feedback on implementing regulatory structures similar to other
states, including the New York State Department of Environmental Protection
CAFO Program.
(b) On or before February 15, 2026, the Secretary of Natural Resources
shall file a report with the House Committees on Agriculture, Food Resiliency,
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.124
2025 Page 54 of 58
and Forestry and on Environment and the Senate Committees on Agriculture
and on Natural Resources and Energy. The report shall:
(1) summarize the stakeholder process, including public comments
received;
(2) summarize public input received during rulemaking;
(3) assess whether the regulatory structure for administering
agricultural water quality requirements in the State is sufficient to ensure that
water pollution is controlled consistent with the Clean Water Act or whether
sole regulation by the Agency of Natural Resources over water quality on
farms, should be implemented; and
(4) recommend any statutory amendment or other changes related to
implementation of the CAFO program and agricultural water quality
regulation more generally.
Sec. 10. 10 V.S.A. § 1259 is amended to read:

Section 12:
§ 1259. PROHIBITIONS
(a) No person shall discharge any waste, substance, or material into waters
of the State, nor shall any person discharge any waste, substance, or material
into an injection well or discharge into a publicly owned treatment works any

Section 13:
section 1263 of this title; nor shall those provisions prohibit stormwater runoff
or the discharge of nonpolluting wastes, as defined by the Secretary.
* * *
(i) The Secretary of Natural Resources, to the extent compatible shall
regulate AFOs in accordance with federal requirements, shall delegate to and
the Secretary of Agriculture, Food and Markets shall implement the State
agricultural non-point nonpoint source pollution control program planning,
implementation, and regulation. A memorandum of understanding shall be
adopted for this purpose, which shall address implementation grants, the
distribution of federal program assistance, and the development of land use
performance standards. Prior to executing the memorandum, the Secretary of
State shall arrange for two formal publications of information relating to the
proposed memorandum. The information shall consist of a summary of the
proposal; the name, telephone number, and address of a person able to answer
questions and receive comments on the proposal; and the deadline for
receiving comments. Publication shall be subject to the provisions of 3 V.S.A. §
839(d), (e), and (g), relating to the publication of administrative rules This
concurrent authority ensures comprehensive water quality protection and

information to enable effective and consistent regulation and enforcement. Not
later than September 1, 2025, the Agency of Natural Resources in consultation
with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Agency of Agriculture,
Food and Markets, shall issue a document that sets forth the respective roles
and responsibilities of the Agency of Natural Resources in implementing the
Clean Water Act on farms and responsibilities of the Agency of Agriculture,
Food and Markets in implementing the State’s complementary nonpoint source
program on farms. The document shall replace the existing memorandum of
understanding between the agencies. The Secretary shall post the draft
document and information regarding the document on the Agency’s website,
shall issue public notice by press release and social media, shall submit the
draft documents to the Senate Committees on Agriculture and on Natural
Resources and Energy and the House Committees on Agriculture, Food

§ 1353. CAFO PERMIT REQUIREMENTS AND EXEMPTIONS
(a) The discharge of manure, litter, or process wastewater to waters of the
State from a permitted CAFO as a result of the application of that manure,
litter, or process wastewater by the CAFO to land areas under its control is a
discharge from that CAFO subject to VPDES permit requirements, except
where it is an agricultural stormwater discharge as provided under the federal
Clean Water Act. For purposes of this subsection, where the manure, litter, or
process wastewater has been applied in accordance with the federal
regulations under the Clean Water Act, a precipitation-related discharge of
manure, litter, or process wastewater from land areas under the control of a
CAFO is an agricultural stormwater discharge. For unpermitted Large
CAFOs, a precipitation-related discharge of manure, litter, or process
wastewater from land areas under the control of the CAFO shall be considered
an exempt agricultural stormwater discharge only where the manure, litter, or
process wastewater has been land applied in accordance with site-specific
nutrient management practices that ensure appropriate agricultural utilization
of the nutrients in the manure, litter, or process wastewater, as determined by
the Secretary.

Rule are not discharging is not applicable to any AFO determined by the
Secretary’s decision to be a CAFO.
Sec. 9. COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDER GROUP ON AGRICULTURAL
WATER QUALITY
(a) On or before December 1, 2025, the Secretary of Natural Resources, in
coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, Food and Markets, shall
engage key stakeholder regarding the implementation and transition to a
Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO) program that conforms with
the Clean Water Act. The process also shall include public notice and
informational hearings to provide updates on the CAFO program and gather
broad public input. The stakeholder engagement process shall include
opportunities for the following stakeholders to provide input: the agricultural
community, including livestock farmers; farm groups; agricultural consultants;
and the environmental community, including watershed groups and water
quality experts. The Secretary shall solicit input from stakeholders on:
(1) the establishment of a CAFO permitting program administered by
the Secretary of Natural Resources that ensures compliance with the Clean
Water Act’s requirement that no farm discharges in violation of the Clean
Water Act’s CAFO permit requirements;
(2) how to align the CAFO program most effectively with water quality
programs administered by the Secretary of Agriculture, Food, and Markets;
(3) how to best create regulatory clarity for agricultural producers for
the long term that is consistent with the Clean Water Act, whether within a
two-agency regulatory system or through a full transfer of regulatory authority
to the Agency of Natural Resources;
(4) the resources, technical assistance, and regulatory structure
necessary to create a path to compliance for agricultural producers that
maintain CAFOs, AFOs, and other farms; and
(5) feedback on implementing regulatory structures similar to other
states, including the New York State Department of Environmental Protection
CAFO Program.
(b) On or before February 15, 2026, the Secretary of Natural Resources
shall file a report with the House Committees on Agriculture, Food Resiliency,

and on Natural Resources and Energy. The report shall:
(1) summarize the stakeholder process, including public comments
received;
(2) summarize public input received during rulemaking;
(3) assess whether the regulatory structure for administering
agricultural water quality requirements in the State is sufficient to ensure that
water pollution is controlled consistent with the Clean Water Act or whether
sole regulation by the Agency of Natural Resources over water quality on
farms, should be implemented; and
(4) recommend any statutory amendment or other changes related to
implementation of the CAFO program and agricultural water quality
regulation more generally.
