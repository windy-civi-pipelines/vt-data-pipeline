21 or process wastewater from land areas under the control of a CAFO is an
VT LEG #382884 v.1

AS PASSED BY SENATE S.124

1 agricultural stormwater discharge. For unpermitted Large CAFOs, a
2 precipitation-related discharge of manure, litter, or process wastewater from
3 land areas under the control of the CAFO shall be considered an exempt
4 agricultural stormwater discharge only where the manure, litter, or process
5 wastewater has been land applied in accordance with site-specific nutrient

8 (1) the establishment of a CAFO permitting program administered by
9 the Secretary of Natural Resources that ensures compliance with the Clean
10 Water Act’s requirement that no farm discharges in violation of the Clean
11 Water Act’s CAFO permit requirements;
12 (2) how to align the CAFO program most effectively with water quality
13 programs administered by the Secretary of Agriculture, Food, and Markets;
14 (3) how to best create regulatory clarity for agricultural producers for
15 the long term that is consistent with the Clean Water Act, whether within a
16 two-agency regulatory system or through a full transfer of regulatory authority
17 to the Agency of Natural Resources;
18 (4) the resources, technical assistance, and regulatory structure
19 necessary to create a path to compliance for agricultural producers that
20 maintain CAFOs, AFOs, and other farms; and

10 (2) summarize public input received during rulemaking;
11 (3) assess whether the regulatory structure for administering agricultural
12 water quality requirements in the State is sufficient to ensure that water
13 pollution is controlled consistent with the Clean Water Act or whether sole
14 regulation by the Agency of Natural Resources over water quality on farms,
15 should be implemented; and
