17 (a) The discharge of manure, litter, or process wastewater to waters of the
18 State from a permitted CAFO as a result of the application of that manure,
19 litter, or process wastewater by the CAFO to land areas under its control is a
20 discharge from that CAFO subject to VPDES permit requirements, except
21 where it is an agricultural stormwater discharge as provided under the federal
VT LEG #384090 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.124
2025 Page 27 of 39
1 Clean Water Act. For purposes of this subsection, where the manure, litter, or
2 process wastewater has been applied in accordance with the federal regulations
3 under the Clean Water Act, a precipitation-related discharge of manure, litter,
4 or process wastewater from land areas under the control of a CAFO is an
5 agricultural stormwater discharge. For unpermitted Large CAFOs, a
6 precipitation-related discharge of manure, litter, or process wastewater from
7 land areas under the control of the CAFO shall be considered an exempt
8 agricultural stormwater discharge only where the manure, litter, or process
9 wastewater has been land applied in accordance with site-specific nutrient
10 management practices that ensure appropriate agricultural utilization of the
11 nutrients in the manure, litter, or process wastewater, as determined by the
12 Secretary.
13 (b) All MFOs and LFOs shall maintain documentation of a nutrient
14 management plan and practices on site or at a nearby office and make the
15 documentation readily available to the Secretary upon request.
16 (c) The presumption in 6 V.S.A. § 4810(b) that farms in compliance with
17 the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets’ Required Agricultural Practices
18 Rule are not discharging is not applicable to any AFO determined by the
19 Secretary’s decision to be a CAFO.

2 WATER QUALITY
3 (a) On or before December 1, 2025, the Secretary of Natural Resources, in
4 coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, Food and Markets, shall engage
5 key stakeholder regarding the implementation and transition to a Concentrated
6 Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO) program that conforms with the Clean
7 Water Act. The process also shall include public notice and informational
8 hearings to provide updates on the CAFO program and gather broad public
9 input. The stakeholder engagement process shall include opportunities for the
10 following stakeholders to provide input: the agricultural community, including
11 livestock farmers; farm groups; agricultural consultants; and the environmental
12 community, including watershed groups and water quality experts. The
13 Secretary shall solicit input from stakeholders on:
14 (1) the establishment of a CAFO permitting program administered by
15 the Secretary of Natural Resources that ensures compliance with the Clean
16 Water Act’s requirement that no farm discharges in violation of the Clean
17 Water Act’s CAFO permit requirements;
18 (2) how to align the CAFO program most effectively with water quality
19 programs administered by the Secretary of Agriculture, Food, and Markets;
20 (3) how to best create regulatory clarity for agricultural producers for
21 the long term that is consistent with the Clean Water Act, whether within a

1 two-agency regulatory system or through a full transfer of regulatory authority
2 to the Agency of Natural Resources;
3 (4) the resources, technical assistance, and regulatory structure
4 necessary to create a path to compliance for agricultural producers that
5 maintain CAFOs, AFOs, and other farms; and
6 (5) feedback on implementing regulatory structures similar to other
7 states, including the New York State Department of Environmental Protection
8 CAFO Program.

13 (1) summarize the stakeholder process, including public comments
14 received;
15 (2) summarize public input received during rulemaking;
16 (3) assess whether the regulatory structure for administering agricultural
17 water quality requirements in the State is sufficient to ensure that water
18 pollution is controlled consistent with the Clean Water Act or whether sole
19 regulation by the Agency of Natural Resources over water quality on farms,
20 should be implemented; and

5 under this section, propose a plan for inspection of animal feeding operations
6 (AFOs) potentially subject to the requirements for a CAFO permit under 10
7 V.S.A. chapter 47, subchapter 3A. The plan shall include:
8 (1) a proposal of which AFOs should be subject to inspection, including
9 whether all large farm operations and medium farm operations must be
10 inspected to determine if a CAFO permit is required;
11 (2) a proposed schedule of inspection of those AFOs subject to
12 inspection, including the frequency of inspection or events or thresholds that
13 would require inspection; and
14 (3) an estimate of the staffing or other resources that would be required
15 to implement the proposed inspection plan.

2025 Page 27 of 39
1 Clean Water Act. For purposes of this subsection, where the manure, litter, or
2 process wastewater has been applied in accordance with the federal regulations
3 under the Clean Water Act, a precipitation-related discharge of manure, litter,
4 or process wastewater from land areas under the control of a CAFO is an
5 agricultural stormwater discharge. For unpermitted Large CAFOs, a
6 precipitation-related discharge of manure, litter, or process wastewater from
7 land areas under the control of the CAFO shall be considered an exempt
8 agricultural stormwater discharge only where the manure, litter, or process
9 wastewater has been land applied in accordance with site-specific nutrient
10 management practices that ensure appropriate agricultural utilization of the
11 nutrients in the manure, litter, or process wastewater, as determined by the
12 Secretary.

17 the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets’ Required Agricultural Practices
18 Rule are not discharging is not applicable to any AFO determined by the
19 Secretary’s decision to be a CAFO.

18 (2) how to align the CAFO program most effectively with water quality
19 programs administered by the Secretary of Agriculture, Food, and Markets;

15 (2) summarize public input received during rulemaking;
16 (3) assess whether the regulatory structure for administering agricultural
17 water quality requirements in the State is sufficient to ensure that water
