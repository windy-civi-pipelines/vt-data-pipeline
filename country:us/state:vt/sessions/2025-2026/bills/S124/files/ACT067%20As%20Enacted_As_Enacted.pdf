VT LEG #384281 v.1

No. 67 Page 24 of 37
2025
(2) Make, adopt, revise, and amend rules as necessary to administer a
VPDES CAFO program that is at least as stringent as the federal Clean Water
Act and enabling rules.
(3) Make, adopt, revise, and amend procedures, guidelines, inspection
checklists, and other documents as necessary for the administration of the
VPDES CAFO program.
(4) Designate any AFO that meets the definition of a CAFO under the
federal Clean Water Act regulations or under the VPDES CAFO Rule as a
CAFO, in the Secretary’s sole discretion.
(5) Require any AFO to obtain a CAFO permit under this chapter upon a
determination that the AFO is discharging to waters of the State.
(6) Designate any small AFO as a CAFO if after an on-site inspection,
the Secretary determines that the small AFO is discharging into water and is a
significant contributor of pollutants to waters of the State. The Secretary shall
consider the following factors:
(A) the size of the AFO and the amount of wastes reaching waters;
(B) the location of the AFO relative to waters;
(C) the means of conveyance of animal wastes and process waste
waters into waters;
(D) the slope, vegetation, rainfall, and other factors affecting the
likelihood or frequency of discharge of animal wastes manure and process
waste waters into waters; and
VT LEG #384281 v.1

No. 67 Page 25 of 37
2025
(E) other relevant factors.
(7) Access private or public property to inspect AFOs and CAFOs, take
photos and samples, and review and copy AFO and CAFO land management
records, including nutrient management plans, as may be necessary to carry out
the provisions of this subchapter.
(8) Solicit and receive federal funds to implement the CAFO program.
(9) Cooperate fully with the federal government or other agencies in the
operation of any joint federal-state programs concerning the regulation of
agricultural pollution.
(10) Appoint assistants or contract with persons with applicable
expertise, subject to applicable laws and State policies, to perform or assist in

§ 1353. CAFO PERMIT REQUIREMENTS AND EXEMPTIONS
(a) The discharge of manure, litter, or process wastewater to waters of the
State from a permitted CAFO as a result of the application of that manure,
litter, or process wastewater by the CAFO to land areas under its control is a
discharge from that CAFO subject to VPDES permit requirements, except
where it is an agricultural stormwater discharge as provided under the federal
Clean Water Act. For purposes of this subsection, where the manure, litter, or
process wastewater has been applied in accordance with the federal regulations
under the Clean Water Act, a precipitation-related discharge of manure, litter,
or process wastewater from land areas under the control of a CAFO is an
VT LEG #384281 v.1

No. 67 Page 26 of 37
2025
agricultural stormwater discharge. For unpermitted Large CAFOs, a
precipitation-related discharge of manure, litter, or process wastewater from
land areas under the control of the CAFO shall be considered an exempt
agricultural stormwater discharge only where the manure, litter, or process
wastewater has been land applied in accordance with site-specific nutrient
management practices that ensure appropriate agricultural utilization of the
nutrients in the manure, litter, or process wastewater, as determined by the
Secretary.
(b) All MFOs and LFOs shall maintain documentation of a nutrient
management plan and practices on site or at a nearby office and make the
documentation readily available to the Secretary upon request.
(c) The presumption in 6 V.S.A. § 4810(b) that farms in compliance with
the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets’ Required Agricultural Practices
Rule are not discharging is not applicable to any AFO determined by the
Secretary’s decision to be a CAFO.
Sec. 9. COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDER GROUP ON AGRICULTURAL
WATER QUALITY
(a) On or before December 1, 2025, the Secretary of Natural Resources, in
coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, Food and Markets, shall engage
key stakeholder regarding the implementation and transition to a Concentrated
Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO) program that conforms with the Clean
Water Act. The process also shall include public notice and informational
VT LEG #384281 v.1

No. 67 Page 27 of 37
2025
hearings to provide updates on the CAFO program and gather broad public
input. The stakeholder engagement process shall include opportunities for the
following stakeholders to provide input: the agricultural community, including
livestock farmers; farm groups; agricultural consultants; and the environmental
community, including watershed groups and water quality experts. The
Secretary shall solicit input from stakeholders on:
(1) the establishment of a CAFO permitting program administered by
the Secretary of Natural Resources that ensures compliance with the Clean
Water Act’s requirement that no farm discharges in violation of the Clean
Water Act’s CAFO permit requirements;
(2) how to align the CAFO program most effectively with water quality
programs administered by the Secretary of Agriculture, Food, and Markets;
(3) how to best create regulatory clarity for agricultural producers for
the long term that is consistent with the Clean Water Act, whether within a
two-agency regulatory system or through a full transfer of regulatory authority
to the Agency of Natural Resources;
(4) the resources, technical assistance, and regulatory structure
necessary to create a path to compliance for agricultural producers that
maintain CAFOs, AFOs, and other farms; and
(5) feedback on implementing regulatory structures similar to other
states, including the New York State Department of Environmental Protection
CAFO Program.

and Forestry and on Environment and the Senate Committees on Agriculture
and on Natural Resources and Energy. The report shall:
(1) summarize the stakeholder process, including public comments
received;
(2) summarize public input received during rulemaking;
(3) assess whether the regulatory structure for administering agricultural
water quality requirements in the State is sufficient to ensure that water
pollution is controlled consistent with the Clean Water Act or whether sole
regulation by the Agency of Natural Resources over water quality on farms,
should be implemented; and
(4) recommend any statutory amendment or other changes related to
implementation of the CAFO program and agricultural water quality regulation
more generally.
(c) The Secretary of Natural Resources shall, as part of the report required
under this section, propose a plan for inspection of animal feeding operations
(AFOs) potentially subject to the requirements for a CAFO permit under 10
V.S.A. chapter 47, subchapter 3A. The plan shall include:
(1) a proposal of which AFOs should be subject to inspection, including
whether all large farm operations and medium farm operations must be
inspected to determine if a CAFO permit is required;
