This act summary is provided for the convenience of the public and members of the General Assembly. It

staff of the Office of Legislative Counsel without input from members of the General Assembly. It is not

Act No. 67 (S.124). An act relating to miscellaneous agricultural subjects
Subjects: Water resources; agriculture; agricultural water quality
This act amends the statutes regulating agricultural water quality, including the
regulation of point source discharges of waste or pollutants from concentrated animal
feeding operations (CAFOs). The act strikes the requirement that the Agency of Natural
Resources (ANR) and the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets (AAF) enter a
memorandum of understanding (MOU) describing how the agencies will comply with
and implement federal CAFO program requirements. In place of the MOU, ANR in
consultation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and AAFM shall issue a
document that sets forth ANR’s responsibilities in implementing the Clean Water Act
(CWA), and AAFM’s responsibilities in implementing the State’s nonpoint source
program on farms.
The act clarifies that ANR is the regulatory entity in the State that is required to
determine if there is a point source discharge from a large or medium CAFO that requires
a CAFO permit. The act defines what constitutes an animal feeding operation, a Large
CAFO, and a Medium CAFO under ANR’s authority. The act also clarifies that the
discharges that ANR shall regulate are point source discharges of wastes or pollutants
from AFOs to waters of the State, including waters of the United States.
The act sets forth the specific authority of the Secretary of Natural Resources to
regulate discharges from CAFOs. The Secretary has authority to implement the federal
CWA to administer a Vermont pollutant discharge elimination system (VPDES) CAFO
program that is at least as stringent as the federal CWA and enabling rules. The
Secretary has authority to adopt rules and guidance to administer a VPDES CAFO
program. The Secretary may designate an AFO that meets the definition of a CAFO as a
CAFO, in Secretary’s sole discretion. Similarly, the Secretary may designate any small
AFO as a CAFO if after an on-site inspection, the Secretary determines that the small
AFO is discharging and is a significant contributor of pollutants to waters of the State.
The act clarifies that a discharge of manure, litter, or process wastewater to waters
from a CAFO as a result of the application of manure, litter, or process wastewater to
land area is a discharge from that CAFO subject to VPDES permit requirements, except
where the manure, litter, or process wastewater has been applied in accordance with a
site-specific nutrient management plan approved by the Secretary. A precipitation-
related discharge of manure, litter, or process wastewater from land areas under the
control of a Large CAFO shall be considered an exempt agricultural stormwater
discharge only where the manure, litter, or process wastewater has been land applied in
accordance with site-specific nutrient management practices that ensure appropriate
agricultural utilization of the nutrients in the manure, litter, or process wastewater. The
act requires all medium farms and large farms to maintain documentation of a nutrient

management plan and practices and to make the documentation readily available to the
Secretary upon request.
The act also provides that if AAFM determines that a farm may be discharging to
waters of the State, AAFM immediately shall refer the potential discharge to ANR for
response according to the federal Clean Water Act CAFO rules. If ANR determines no
CAFO permit is required, ANR notifies AAFM so that AAFM may regulate the farm. If
a farm is required to obtain a CAFO permit, AAFM’s vegetated buffer requirements no
longer apply, and the farm must comply with the federal buffer requirements.
The act amends the ban on the land application of manure between December 15 and
April 1 to allow AAFM to authorize an emergency exemption from the ban. The act also
clarifies that AAFM may require any new small farm to certify compliance with the
required agricultural practices (RAPs) and AAFM may require any farm to regularly
certify ongoing compliance with the RAPs.
The act makes several conforming amendments, including clarifying when a farm
required to obtain a CAFO permit will no longer be presumed to be in compliance with
water quality requirements if the farm is compliant with the RAPs. The act also
establishes a Community Stakeholder Group on Agricultural Water Quality to engage
key agricultural stakeholders as part of a pre-rulemaking process to gather input on
proposed CAFO rules and how best to implement ANR’s CAFO program. The
Stakeholder Group shall report its finding to the General Assembly
