20 discharge from that CAFO subject to VPDES permit requirements, except
21 where it is an agricultural stormwater discharge as provided under the federal
VT LEG #383993 v.1

HOUSE PROPOSAL OF AMENDMENT S.124
2025 Page 27 of 39
1 Clean Water Act. For purposes of this subsection, where the manure, litter, or
2 process wastewater has been applied in accordance with the federal regulations
3 under the Clean Water Act, a precipitation-related discharge of manure, litter,
4 or process wastewater from land areas under the control of a CAFO is an
5 agricultural stormwater discharge. For unpermitted Large CAFOs, a
6 precipitation-related discharge of manure, litter, or process wastewater from
7 land areas under the control of the CAFO shall be considered an exempt
8 agricultural stormwater discharge only where the manure, litter, or process
9 wastewater has been land applied in accordance with site-specific nutrient
10 management practices that ensure appropriate agricultural utilization of the
11 nutrients in the manure, litter, or process wastewater, as determined by the
12 Secretary.
13 (b) All MFOs and LFOs shall maintain documentation of a nutrient
14 management plan and practices on site or at a nearby office and make the

16 (c) The presumption in 6 V.S.A. § 4810(b) that farms in compliance with
17 the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets’ Required Agricultural Practices
18 Rule are not discharging is not applicable to any AFO determined by the
19 Secretary’s decision to be a CAFO.

1 (a) On or before December 1, 2025, the Secretary of Natural Resources, in
2 coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, Food and Markets, shall engage
3 key stakeholder regarding the implementation and transition to a Concentrated
4 Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO) program that conforms with the Clean
5 Water Act. The process also shall include public notice and informational
6 hearings to provide updates on the CAFO program and gather broad public
7 input. The stakeholder engagement process shall include opportunities for the
8 following stakeholders to provide input: the agricultural community, including
9 livestock farmers; farm groups; agricultural consultants; and the environmental
10 community, including watershed groups and water quality experts. The
11 Secretary shall solicit input from stakeholders on:
12 (1) the establishment of a CAFO permitting program administered by
13 the Secretary of Natural Resources that ensures compliance with the Clean
14 Water Act’s requirement that no farm discharges in violation of the Clean
15 Water Act’s CAFO permit requirements;
16 (2) how to align the CAFO program most effectively with water quality
17 programs administered by the Secretary of Agriculture, Food and Markets;
18 (3) how to best create regulatory clarity for agricultural producers for
19 the long term that is consistent with the Clean Water Act, whether within a
20 two-agency regulatory system or through a full transfer of regulatory authority
21 to the Agency of Natural Resources;
VT LEG #383993 v.1

HOUSE PROPOSAL OF AMENDMENT S.124
2025 Page 29 of 39
1 (4) the resources, technical assistance, and regulatory structure
2 necessary to create a path to compliance for agricultural producers that
3 maintain CAFOs, AFOs, and other farms; and

10 and on Natural Resources and Energy. The report shall:
11 (1) summarize the stakeholder process, including public comments
12 received;
13 (2) summarize public input received during rulemaking;
14 (3) assess whether the regulatory structure for administering agricultural
15 water quality requirements in the State is sufficient to ensure that water
16 pollution is controlled consistent with the Clean Water Act or whether sole
17 regulation by the Agency of Natural Resources over water quality on farms,
18 should be implemented; and
19 (4) recommend any statutory amendment or other changes related to
20 implementation of the CAFO program and agricultural water quality regulation
21 more generally.
