(H.C.R.89)
Offered by Representatives Canfield of Fair Haven, Casey of Hubbardton, Harvey of
Castleton, McCoy of Poultney, and Toof of St. Albans Town
Offered by Senators Collamore, Hardy, Heffernan, Weeks, and Williams
Whereas, the Division II girls’ basketball ultimate playoff game at Barre Auditorium
proved to be a contest between two closely matched and defensively focused squads, and
Whereas, the top-seeded North Country Falcons narrowly led the second-ranked and
defending titleholder, Fair Haven Slaters, 22–21, with roughly three minutes remaining in
the third period, a score that left the final outcome unknown to all the fans watching at
the Barre Auditorium, and
Whereas, recognizing that they were perilously close to losing their championship
title, the Slaters charged full steam ahead, igniting a 9–0 scoring spree that reset the
scenario with an encouraging 30–22 Fair Haven lead, and although North Country
momentarily regained momentum, narrowing the Rutland County hoopsters’ advantage
to 30–29, Fair Haven’s final surge contributed to the Slaters’ 37–31 come-from-behind
victory, and
Whereas, the Slaters’ roster featured Elizabeth Love, Orianna Kerr, Megan Wetmore,
Maddy Perry, Kate Hadwen, Quinn Murphy, Riley Babbie, Audrey Perry, Madi Hayes,
Isabelle Cole, Callie LaRock, Brianna Cathcart, Ryleigh Murray, and Victoria Kelly, and
Whereas, Head Coach Kyle Wilson; assistant coaches Jay Wilson, Leo Hutchins,
Chad Wilson, and Henry Daley; and team managers Rose Ouimet and Taylor Wilson
appreciated the extra initiative that the team contributed to the successful 2025 season,
now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2025 Fair Haven Union High School
Slaters girls’ basketball team on winning a second consecutive Division II championship,
and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Fair Haven Union High School.
