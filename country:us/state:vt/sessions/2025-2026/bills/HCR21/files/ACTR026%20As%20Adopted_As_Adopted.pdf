No. R-26. House concurrent resolution expressing strong appreciation for the
essential role of Vermont’s school board members in the State’s public education
system and designating February as School Board Recognition Month in Vermont.
(H.C.R.21)
Offered by All Members of the House
Whereas, the education of Vermont’s youth is of great importance, and the role of
local school board members is essential in this process, and
Whereas, all too often, Vermonters do not fully appreciate the scope of the
commitment school board members must make to their duties and the challenges they
encounter in performing this critical civic role, and
Whereas, as the citizens of Vermont, and the General Assembly in particular, engage
in a major examination of education financing in our State, school board members will be
important contributors to this critical discussion, and
Whereas, these special community public servants deserve our admiration and respect
for their continuing devotion to the success of public education in Vermont,
now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly expresses strong appreciation for the essential role of
Vermont’s school board members in the State’s public education system and designates
February as School Board Recognition Month in Vermont, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the Vermont School Boards Association.
