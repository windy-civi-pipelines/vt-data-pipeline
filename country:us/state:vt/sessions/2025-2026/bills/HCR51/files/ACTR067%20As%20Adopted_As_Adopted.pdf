Whereas, an initiative of the Governor is bestowing special recognition on an
individual or group for the performance of deeds that “meet the moment, going above
and beyond to do their part, showing that we are much stronger when we are united,” and
Whereas, the scope of initiatives includes “organized efforts to help our families,
friends, and neighbors…[as well as]…those simple, unexpected, everyday acts of
kindness and goodwill…that can make the biggest difference,” and
Whereas, the Governor is designating these actions as “acts of kindness,” and he is
“shining a light on acts of kindness, selfless service and goodwill throughout our
[S]tate,” and
Whereas, one of the individuals the Governor has bestowed recognition on is Louis
Lamphere of Colchester, who has demonstrated a special generosity towards his
neighbors, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly honors Louis Lamphere on his receipt of the gubernatorial
Rays of Kindness recognition, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Louis Lamphere.
