of Brattleboro, and Mrowicki of Putney
Offered by Senators Harrison and Hashim
House concurrent resolution honoring Shaun Murphy of Guilford for his nearly quarter century of
exemplary educational governance public service
Whereas, as a school board member, Shaun Murphy has strived to preserve the best of Vermont’s system of
public education while thinking forward towards the future, and
Whereas, his involvement with public education started in 2001 as a member of the Citizen Advisory
Committee established to develop the renovation plan for Brattleboro Union High School and to prepare a bond
issue, and
Whereas, this milestone odyssey in educational planning and strategizing proved successful, as the largest
then-to-date bond issue in Vermont was passed, the construction work completed, and the school was able to
maintain its accreditation, and
Whereas, as a result of his membership on this unusual panel, Shaun Murphy developed a strong desire to
continue his participation as a citizen public education overseer, and
Whereas, not surprisingly, the BUHS District 6 Board, then responsible for the oversight of Brattleboro
Union High School, was his destination, and
Whereas, in 2019, the Windham Southeast School District was created, replacing the BUHS District 6
Board, and Shaun Murphy joined this new school committee and served diligently until March 2025, and
Whereas, for the period 2024–2025, Shaun Murphy also served on the separate Windham Southeast
Supervisory Union Board, and for many years, he was a member of the Guilford School Board, and
Whereas, throughout his over two decades of school board service, Shaun Murphy was committed to
supporting the highest quality educational experience, and he advocated for the rights of all students, especially
those of color, those who were LGBTQIA+, and individuals with disabilities, and
Whereas, complextopics, such as school financing, never intimidated him; he always worked with dignity
and courtesy, observing the highest ethical standards and acting with courage and conviction, even during times
of stress; and his public school board service constituted the highest strata of excellence, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly honors Shaun Murphy of Guilford for his nearly quarter century of exemplary
educational governance public service, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to Shaun Murphy.
