Whereas, as a school board member, Shaun Murphy has strived to preserve the best of
Vermont’s system of public education while thinking forward towards the future, and
Whereas, his involvement with public education started in 2001 as a member of the
Citizen Advisory Committee established to develop the renovation plan for Brattleboro
Union High School and to prepare a bond issue, and
Whereas, this milestone odyssey in educational planning and strategizing proved
successful, as the largest then-to-date bond issue in Vermont was passed, the construction
work completed, and the school was able to maintain its accreditation, and
Whereas, as a result of his membership on this unusual panel, Shaun Murphy
developed a strong desire to continue his participation as a citizen public education
overseer, and
Whereas, not surprisingly, the BUHS District 6 Board, then responsible for the
oversight of Brattleboro Union High School, was his destination, and
Whereas, in 2019, the Windham Southeast School District was created, replacing the
BUHS District 6 Board, and Shaun Murphy joined this new school committee and served
diligently until March 2025, and
Whereas, for the period 2024–2025, Shaun Murphy also served on the separate
Windham Southeast Supervisory Union Board, and for many years, he was a member of
the Guilford School Board, and
Whereas, throughout his over two decades of school board service, Shaun Murphy
was committed to supporting the highest quality educational experience, and he
advocated for the rights of all students, especially those of color, those who were
LGBTQIA+, and individuals with disabilities, and
Whereas, complex topics, such as school financing, never intimidated him; he always
worked with dignity and courtesy, observing the highest ethical standards and acting with
courage and conviction, even during times of stress; and his public school board service
constituted the highest strata of excellence, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly honors Shaun Murphy of Guilford for his nearly quarter
century of exemplary educational governance public service, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Shaun Murphy.
