H.C.R. 145
Bennington, Gregoire of Fairfield, Headrick of Burlington, Luneau of St. Albans City, Minier of South
Burlington, Morrissey of Bennington, Sweeney of Shelburne, and Winter of Ludlow
House concurrent resolution celebrating the 35th anniversary of the installation of the first piece of art for
the Art in State Buildings Program
Whereas, in 1988 Acts and Resolves No. 267, the General Assembly enacted “An act relating to art in public
buildings” in recognition of the State’s need to “encourage the work of Vermont artists; to enhance and preserve
its cultural environment and heritage; and to provide artistic enrichment to its residents and visitors,” and
Whereas, now known as the Art in State Buildings Program, the State’s structures have been brightened,
enlivened, and made more welcoming for employees and visitors alike due to the presence of varied
creations, and
Whereas, since the first artwork was installed in a State building in 1990, hundreds of Vermont-crafted
pieces have found wonderful homes at courthouses, institutions of higher education, office buildings, public
safety facilities, the State House, and other Stated-owned venues throughout Vermont, and
Whereas, the created artworks, be they drawings, paintings, sculptures, or other mediums, enhance civic
pride and portray the story of Vermonters and the State’s culture, history, landscape, and values, and
Whereas, the employment of Vermont artists and craftspeople is a worthy investment in the creative
economy, supports local talent, and provides an incentive for artistic Vermonters to pursue careers in the
State, and
Whereas, these creative works often portray environmental and stewardship themes, reflecting Vermont’s
strong connection to its natural and working landscapes, and they contribute to a State art collection that affords
a distinctive perspective on our cultural history, and
Whereas, the Art in State Buildings Program is a valued public investment that brings beauty to our lives and
is a legacy for future generations to cherish and expand in new and exciting directions, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly celebrates the 35th anniversary of the installation of the first piece of art for the
Art in State Buildings Program, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the Vermont Arts
Council.
