Whereas, in 1988 Acts and Resolves No. 267, the General Assembly enacted “An act
relating to art in public buildings” in recognition of the State’s need to “encourage the
work of Vermont artists; to enhance and preserve its cultural environment and heritage;
and to provide artistic enrichment to its residents and visitors,” and
Whereas, now known as the Art in State Buildings Program, the State’s structures
have been brightened, enlivened, and made more welcoming for employees and visitors
alike due to the presence of varied creations, and
Whereas, since the first artwork was installed in a State building in 1990, hundreds of
Vermont-crafted pieces have found wonderful homes at courthouses, institutions of
higher education, office buildings, public safety facilities, the State House, and other
Stated-owned venues throughout Vermont, and
Whereas, the created artworks, be they drawings, paintings, sculptures, or other
mediums, enhance civic pride and portray the story of Vermonters and the State’s culture,
history, landscape, and values, and
Whereas, the employment of Vermont artists and craftspeople is a worthy investment
in the creative economy, supports local talent, and provides an incentive for artistic
Vermonters to pursue careers in the State, and
Whereas, these creative works often portray environmental and stewardship themes,
reflecting Vermont’s strong connection to its natural and working landscapes, and they
contribute to a State art collection that affords a distinctive perspective on our cultural
history, and
Whereas, the Art in State Buildings Program is a valued public investment that brings
beauty to our lives and is a legacy for future generations to cherish and expand in new
and exciting directions, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly celebrates the 35th anniversary of the installation of the
first piece of art for the Art in State Buildings Program, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the Vermont Arts Council.
