Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 44
Offered by Representatives Krasnow of South Burlington, Burkhardt of
South Burlington, LaLonde of South Burlington, Minier of South Burlington,
and Nugent of South Burlington
House concurrent resolution recognizing July 2025 as Park and Recreation
Month in Vermont and designating July 18, 2025 as Vermont Park and
Recreation Professionals Day in Vermont
Whereas, Vermont’s park and recreation programs are an integral part of
our State and local communities, and
Whereas, their presence in a community promotes an active lifestyle, offers
environmental protection, and serves as an economic resource, and
Whereas, park and recreation programs support the effectiveness of
therapeutic recreational services for persons with disabilities, and
Whereas, in 1985, the National Recreation and Park Association established
July as Park and Recreation Month, and, in 2009, the U.S. House of
Representatives adopted H.R. 288, a resolution “Recognizing the importance
of park and recreation facilities and expressing support for the designation of
the month of July as ‘National Park and Recreation Month,’”
now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly recognizes July 2025 as Park and Recreation
Month in Vermont and designates July 18, 2025 as Vermont Park and
Recreation Professionals Day, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this
resolution to the Vermont Recreation and Parks Association.
