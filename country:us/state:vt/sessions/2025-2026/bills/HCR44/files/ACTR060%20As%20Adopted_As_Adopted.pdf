Whereas, Vermont’s park and recreation programs are an integral part of our State and
local communities, and
Whereas, their presence in a community promotes an active lifestyle, offers
environmental protection, and serves as an economic resource, and
Whereas, park and recreation programs support the effectiveness of therapeutic
recreational services for persons with disabilities, and
Whereas, in 1985, the National Recreation and Park Association established July as
Park and Recreation Month, and, in 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives adopted
H.R. 288, a resolution “Recognizing the importance of park and recreation facilities and
expressing support for the designation of the month of July as ‘National Park and
Recreation Month,’” now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly recognizes July 2025 as Park and Recreation Month in
Vermont and designates July 18, 2025 as Vermont Park and Recreation Professionals
Day, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the Vermont Recreation and Parks Association.
