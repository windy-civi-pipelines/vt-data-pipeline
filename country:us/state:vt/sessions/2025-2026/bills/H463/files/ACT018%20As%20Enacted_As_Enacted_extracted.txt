use, manufacture, process, transport, or otherwise handle or work on any
goods, articles, materials, or commodities or to perform any services; or (ii) to

is:
(A) Forcing or requiring any employer or self-employed person to
join any labor or employer organization or to enter into any agreement that is
prohibited by subsection (c) of this section.
(B) Forcing or requiring any person to cease using, selling, handling,

certification of the Board determining the bargaining representative for
employees performing such work. This subsection (b) shall not be construed
to make unlawful a refusal by any person to enter upon the premises of any
employer, other than the person’s own employer, if the employees of such
employer are engaged in a strike ratified or approved by a representative of
such employees whom the employer is required to recognize under this
chapter. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to prohibit publicity,
other than picketing, for the purpose of truthfully advising the public, including
consumers and members of a labor organization, that a product or products are
produced by an employer with whom the labor organization has a primary
dispute and are distributed by another employer, as long as such publicity does
not have an effect of inducing any individual employed by any person other
than the primary employer in the course of employment to refuse to pick up,
deliver, or transport any goods, or not to perform any services, at the
establishment of the employer engaged in such distribution.

certification of the Board determining the bargaining representative for
employees performing such work. This subsection (b) shall not be construed

employer, other than the person’s own employer, if the employees of such
employer are engaged in a strike ratified or approved by a representative of
such employees whom the employer is required to recognize under this
chapter. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to prohibit publicity,
other than picketing, for the purpose of truthfully advising the public, including
consumers and members of a labor organization, that a product or products are
produced by an employer with whom the labor organization has a primary
dispute and are distributed by another employer, as long as such publicity does
not have an effect of inducing any individual employed by any person other
than the primary employer in the course of employment to refuse to pick up,
deliver, or transport any goods, or not to perform any services, at the
establishment of the employer engaged in such distribution.
