behavior,” and
Whereas, most experts calculate that nearly seven million Americans 65 years of age
and older are living with this disease, and
Whereas, in Vermont, 12,800 individuals 65 years of age and older are living with
Alzheimer’s, and in 2020 (the most recent calculation of this statistic), 9.9 percent of the
State’s residents in this age cohort were its victims, and

Whereas, the impact of Alzheimer’s in Vermont is not limited to those who are living

for 2025 is $158 million, and
Whereas, today, April 10, 2025, family members, caregivers, and medical
professionals are gathered at the State House to inform the General Assembly of the
