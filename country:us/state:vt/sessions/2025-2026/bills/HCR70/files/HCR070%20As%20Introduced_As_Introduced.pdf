State of Vermont
House of Representatives
Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 70
Offered by All Members of the House
House concurrent resolution designating April 10, 2025 as Alzheimer’s Awareness Day at the State House
Whereas, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Alzheimer’s disease is a
“progressive neurogenerative disease that occurs when nerve cells in the brain die,” and it can result in
“[i]mpaired memory, thinking and behavior,” and
Whereas, most experts calculate that nearly seven million Americans 65 years of age and older are living
with this disease, and
Whereas, in Vermont, 12,800 individuals 65 years of age and older are living with Alzheimer’s, and in 2020
(the most recent calculation of this statistic), 9.9 percent of the State’s residents in this age cohort were its
victims, and
Whereas, in 2022, Alzheimer’s was the cause of death for 329 Vermonters, making the disease the fourth-
leading cause of death in the State and representing a 145.5 percent increase during the years 2000–2022, and
Whereas, the impact of Alzheimer’s in Vermont is not limited to those who are living with the disease, as
approximately 20,000 Vermonters are dedicating 29 million hours to individuals’ Alzheimer’s care, a
commitment currently valued at $773 million, and 61.5 percent of the caregivers have chronic health
conditions, 35.4 percent are suffering with depression, and 10.7 percent are in poor physical health, and
Whereas, the projected Medicaid cost associated with Alzheimer’s care in Vermont for 2025 is $158
million, and
Whereas, today, April 10, 2025, family members, caregivers, and medical professionals are gathered at the
State House to inform the General Assembly of the financial, personal, and societal implications of Alzheimer’s
disease in Vermont, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly designates April 10, 2025 as Alzheimer’s Awareness Day at the State House, and
be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the Alzheimer’s
Association, Vermont Chapter.
