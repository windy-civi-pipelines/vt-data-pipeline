House concurrent resolution congratulating the 2025 Burlington High School Seahorses Division I
championship girls’ basketball team
Whereas, 49 years is an extraordinary interval between earning championship titles, or even playing in this
decisive game, but that was the Seahorses’ legacy, and in 2025, they were determined to end this prolonged
drought on both scores, and
Whereas, fielding a talented third-seeded team, Burlington tipped off at the University of Vermont’s Patrick
Gymnasium before a cheering hometown crowd against the top-seeded St. Johnsbury Academy Hilltoppers, and
Whereas, Burlington emerged onto the court after Wanda Hines, a special fan and supporter, and a Seahorses
MVP in 1975 and 1976 (the last two years the team won a divisional championship), delivered an inspiring pre-
game pep talk to the players, and
Whereas, the highly motivated Seahorses were in command throughout the game, developing a first-quarter
18-point lead, and with two of the girls scoring 20 points each, the 53–33 victory was most satisfying but
hardly surprising, and
Whereas, the history-making Seahorses (19–4) were Emma Maley, Nylah Mitchell, Bree McDonald, Mae
Yenkavitch, Hawa Mubarak, Sienna Pitts, Rowan Thomas-Demeritt, Harper Gutheim, Roslen Wallstrom, Rosa
Kori, and Elizabeth Lorrain, and
Whereas, Head Coach Beverlis Robertson, assistant coaches Brittany Robertson and Klaire Ware, and
Manager Livia Jatlow-Carter were stupendous teachers and supporters, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2025 Burlington High School Seahorses Division I
championship girls’ basketball team, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to Burlington High
School.
