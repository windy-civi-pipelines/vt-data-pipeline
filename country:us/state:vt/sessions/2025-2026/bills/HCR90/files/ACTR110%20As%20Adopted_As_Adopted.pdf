Whereas, 49 years is an extraordinary interval between earning championship titles, or
even playing in this decisive game, but that was the Seahorses’ legacy, and in 2025, they
were determined to end this prolonged drought on both scores, and
Whereas, fielding a talented third-seeded team, Burlington tipped off at the University
of Vermont’s Patrick Gymnasium before a cheering hometown crowd against the top-
seeded St. Johnsbury Academy Hilltoppers, and
Whereas, Burlington emerged onto the court after Wanda Hines, a special fan and
supporter, and a Seahorses MVP in 1975 and 1976 (the last two years the team won a
divisional championship), delivered an inspiring pre-game pep talk to the players, and
Whereas, the highly motivated Seahorses were in command throughout the game,
developing a first-quarter 18-point lead, and with two of the girls scoring 20 points each,
the 53–33 victory was most satisfying but hardly surprising, and
Whereas, the history-making Seahorses (19–4) were Emma Maley, Nylah Mitchell,
Bree McDonald, Mae Yenkavitch, Hawa Mubarak, Sienna Pitts, Rowan Thomas-
Demeritt, Harper Gutheim, Roslen Wallstrom, Rosa Kori, and Elizabeth Lorrain, and
Whereas, Head Coach Beverlis Robertson, assistant coaches Brittany Robertson and
Klaire Ware, and Manager Livia Jatlow-Carter were stupendous teachers and supporters,
now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2025 Burlington High School Seahorses
Division I championship girls’ basketball team, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Burlington High School.
