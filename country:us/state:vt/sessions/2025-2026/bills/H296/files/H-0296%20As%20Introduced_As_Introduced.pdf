16 (1) increase public access to dietetics services;
17 (2) provide opportunities for interstate practice by licensed dietitians

17 respective state law, any member state may participate with other member

11 and follow the administrative requirements to reapply to obtain a compact
12 privilege in any remote state.

15 (a) The Compact Commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to
16 effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and
17 provisions of the Compact. A rule shall be invalid and have no force or effect

VT LEG #378692 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.296
2025 Page 32 of 44
1 (b) The rules of the Compact Commission shall have the force of law in
2 each member state, provided however that where the rules conflict with the
3 laws or regulations of a member state that relate to the procedures, actions, and
4 processes a licensed dietitian is permitted to undertake in that state and the
5 circumstances under which they may do so, as held by a court of competent
6 jurisdiction, the rules of the Compact Commission shall be ineffective in that
7 state to the extent of the conflict.

9 pursuant to the criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted

13 portion of a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner
14 used to adopt the Compact within four years of the date of adoption of the rule,
15 then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any member state.

20 (4) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested
21 person; and

10 final action on the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and the full

VT LEG #378692 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.296

1 (l) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Compact Commission
2 may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 24 hours’ notice, with
3 opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures
4 provided in the Compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the
5 rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety days after the
6 effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency
7 rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:
8 (1) meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
9 (2) prevent a loss of Compact Commission or member state funds;
10 (3) meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established by
11 federal law or rule; or
12 (4) protect public health and safety.
13 (m) The Compact Commission or an authorized committee of the Compact
14 Commission may direct revision to a previously adopted rule for purposes of

5 Compact.
6 § 3391k. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT

13 solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal
14 office of the Compact Commission is located. The Compact Commission may
15 waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to
16 participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall
17 affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a
18 licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
19 (3) The Compact Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
20 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the

VT LEG #378692 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.296

10 Compact Commission may take and shall offer training and specific technical
11 assistance regarding the default.
12 (2) The Compact Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of
13 default to the other member states.
14 (c) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be
15 terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the
16 delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits
17 conferred on that state by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date
18 of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of
19 obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
20 (d) Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after
21 all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent
VT LEG #378692 v.1

16 state.
17 (h) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Compact Commission
18 by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the
19 federal district where the Compact Commission has its principal offices. The
20 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
21 reasonable attorney’s fees.

9 action against a member state in default in the U.S. District Court for the
10 District of Columbia or the federal district where the Compact Commission has
11 its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact
12 and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
13 and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing
14 party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable

16 Compact Commission. The Compact Commission may pursue any other
17 remedies available under federal or the defaulting member state’s law.
18 (2) A member state may initiate legal action against the Compact
19 Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the

VT LEG #378692 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.296

2 the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
3 awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
4 (3) No party other than a member state shall enforce this Compact
5 against the Compact Commission.
6 § 3391l. EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
7 (a) The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact
8 statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state.
9 (1) On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Compact
10 Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the first seven

18 § 3391m. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
19 (a) This Compact and the Compact Commission’s rulemaking authority
20 shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the
21 implementation and administration of the Compact. Provisions of the
VT LEG #378692 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.296

1 Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not
2 be construed to limit the Compact Commission’s rulemaking authority solely

5 clause, sentence, or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent
6 jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, a state

8 applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is
9 held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of
10 the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any other
11 government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
12 (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, the Compact
13 Commission may deny a state’s participation in the Compact or, in accordance
14 with the requirements of subsection 3391k(b) of this subchapter, terminate a
15 member state’s participation in the Compact, if it determines that a
16 constitutional requirement of a member state is a material departure from the
17 Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to the
18 constitution of any member state, the Compact shall remain in full force and
19 effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the
20 member state affected as to all severable matters.
