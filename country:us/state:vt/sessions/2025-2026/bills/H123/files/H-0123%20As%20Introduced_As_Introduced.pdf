1 H.123
2 Introduced by Representative Arsenault of Williston
3 Referred to Committee on
4 Date:
5 Subject: Motor vehicles; operation of vehicles; drunken driving; driving while
6 ability impaired
7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to create a new
8 civil violation for driving while ability impaired. Under this new violation, a
9 person will commit such an offense when the person’s blood alcohol content is
10 not less than 0.06 but not exceeding 0.079. In the proposed bill, a person
11 adjudicated of the civil violation would be subject to a civil penalty of not
12 more than $500.00 and the same suspension of driving privileges as someone
13 convicted of driving under the influence, but the person would not have an
14 entry on the person’s criminal record.
15 An act relating to driving while ability impaired
16 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
17 Sec. 1. 23 V.S.A. § 1201 is amended to read:

14 while ability impaired.

16 evidence, including the results of any independent alcohol assessment that was
17 conducted at the person’s own expense. Evidence regarding any such
18 screening or an alcohol assessment performed at the expense of the defendant
19 shall not be admissible for any other purpose without the defendant’s consent.
