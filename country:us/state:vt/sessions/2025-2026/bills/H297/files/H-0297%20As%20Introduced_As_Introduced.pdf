19 The General Assembly finds that:
VT LEG #379260 v.2

1 (1) According to the New England Secondary School Consortium,
2 Vermont’s high school graduates continue on to college at the lowest rates in
3 New England at 45 percent, with students with low income, Black students,
4 students with disabilities, and male students facing the deepest equity gaps in
5 continuation rates.
6 (2) Rapidly declining college aspirations among youth since 2020, as
7 revealed by survey data from the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation
8 (VSAC), signal that continuation rates will sink lower.
9 (3) College degrees, especially associate’s degrees, have enduring value.
10 Associate’s degree graduates in Vermont are the most likely in the country to
11 achieve a positive return on investment at 79 percent, according to Strada
12 Education Foundation.
13 (4) Free accelerated associate’s degree pathways are a high-leverage
14 opportunity to improve Vermont’s college continuation rates among students
15 furthest from opportunity.
16 (5) Vermont’s enabling conditions to improve college attainment
17 through accelerated associate’s degree pathways are strong due to the
18 following factors:
19 (A) Vermont has a single, statewide community college. The
20 Community College of Vermont (CCV) serves the greatest number of
21 Vermonters and of Vermonters with low income of any college in the State via
VT LEG #379260 v.2

1 12 locations and extensive learning options. Over 25 percent of CCV students
2 are high school students.
3 (B) With the enactment of 2013 Acts and Resolves No. 77,
4 Vermont’s flexible pathways bill, Vermont has a 10-plus year history of
5 offering flexible pathways to graduation that include a free year of full-time
6 college in lieu of a traditional 12th grade year. Historically, most participating
7 students enroll at CCV.
8 (i) Act 77 was established to develop and expand high-quality
9 secondary education experiences, to promote opportunities for postsecondary
10 readiness, and to increase high school completion and postsecondary
11 continuation. Act 77 offers Vermont students two free dual enrollment courses
12 plus the opportunity to enroll in Early College their senior year.
13 (ii) Early College in Vermont allows seniors to complete their last
14 year of high school and their first year of college at the same time, earning free
15 college credits that also count toward graduation from high school.
16 (C) Vermont has established cross-sector partnerships. The cross-
17 sector Early College Equity Working Group has spent several years analyzing
18 data, building a shared vision, exploring promising practices, and addressing
19 barriers. In 2004, a cross-sector team from Vermont was invited to participate
20 in the national Accelerate ED community to build on this work.

1 (D) Recent public investments in college affordability. Facing a
2 shrinking workforce and an economy with two job openings for every
3 jobseeker, policymakers have committed to investing in talent, particularly
4 through CCV and with the 802 Opportunity Grant.
5 (E) Since 2022, the McClure Foundation’s Free Degree Promise has
6 built on Vermont’s Early College program at CCV to create a free, fast-tracked
7 associate’s degree pathway available to all Vermont youth in the high school
8 classes of 2023–2026.
9 (F) Two and a half years since its launch, emerging data shows the
10 Free Degree Promise is working to equitably scale accelerated degrees for
11 Vermont youth. Since the Promise was announced in spring 2022, CCV has
12 seen a 150 percent increase in enrollment of students with low income in the
13 State’s Early College program at CCV and triple the number of CCV’s Early
14 College program completers persisting near-full-time at CCV toward a degree.
15 Over half of the 2024–2025 Free Degree Promise student cohort are first-
16 generation college students.
17 (G) CCV majors closely align with Vermont’s identified workforce
18 needs.
