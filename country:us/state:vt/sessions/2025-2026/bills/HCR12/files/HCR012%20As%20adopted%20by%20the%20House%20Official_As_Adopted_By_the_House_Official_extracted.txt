school’s first NCAA Division I men’s soccer championship (College Cup)
Whereas, the saga of the 2024 University of Vermont (UVM) men’s soccer squad, affectionately known as
the “Cardiac Cats” in honor of their late game-winning goals, exceeds the allure of a Grimm Brothers’ fairy
tale, and
Whereas, although they were the 2024 America East men’s soccer champions, unseeded UVM astounded the
pundits as the Catamounts reached the coveted semifinal round, winning this penultimate soccer challenge
against the third-seeded University of Denver in a thrilling 4–3 overtime triumph, and
Whereas, in the championship game, played at the WakeMed Soccer Park in Cary, North Carolina, and
bound for legendary status, UVM faced 13th-ranked Marshall University; and despite Marshall scoring first at
the 67-minute mark, UVM rebounded with a goal in the 81st minute, forcing the game into a climactic overtime
period, when the Cardiac Cats (16–2–6) clinched the NCAA title with a decisive goal less than five minutes
into the extra time frame, and
Whereas, these amazing Catamounts were Lou Liedtka, Niklas Herceg, Nathan Siméon, Mike Bleeker, Cole
Richardson, Adrian Schulze Solano, Connor Thompson, Andrew Millar, Niels Hartman, Maximilian Kissel,

Whereas, Head Coach Robert Dow, Associate Head Coach Brad Cole, Assistant Coach Rory Twomey,
Goalkeeper Coach Brendan Pulley, Assistant Athletic Performance Coach Mike Ederer, Athletic Trainer
Hannah Tremel, Director of Operations Mack Walton, and student managers Eli Ross and Eric Bissell were all
elated with this amazing victory, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2024 University of Vermont Catamounts on winning their
school’s first NCAA Division I men’s soccer championship (College Cup), and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the University of
