Vermont Catamounts on winning their school’s first NCAA Division I men’s soccer
championship (College Cup).

Whereas, the saga of the 2024 University of Vermont (UVM) men’s soccer squad,
affectionately known as the “Cardiac Cats” in honor of their late game-winning goals,
exceeds the allure of a Grimm Brothers’ fairy tale, and
Whereas, although they were the 2024 America East men’s soccer champions,
unseeded UVM astounded the pundits as the Catamounts reached the coveted semifinal
round, winning this penultimate soccer challenge against the third-seeded University of
Denver in a thrilling 4–3 overtime triumph, and
Whereas, in the championship game, played at the WakeMed Soccer Park in Cary,
North Carolina, and bound for legendary status, UVM faced 13th-ranked Marshall
University; and despite Marshall scoring first at the 67-minute mark, UVM rebounded
with a goal in the 81st minute, forcing the game into a climactic overtime period, when
the Cardiac Cats (16–2–6) clinched the NCAA title with a decisive goal less than five
minutes into the extra time frame, and
Whereas, these amazing Catamounts were Lou Liedtka, Niklas Herceg, Nathan
Siméon, Mike Bleeker, Cole Richardson, Adrian Schulze Solano, Connor Thompson,
Andrew Millar, Niels Hartman, Maximilian Kissel, Nick Lockermann, Yaniv Bazini,
Nash Barlow, David Ismail, Ethan Czaporowski, Gianluca Armellino, Ioannis Vassiliou,
Marcell Papp, Toby Grant, Karl Daly, Sydney Wathuta, TJ Liquori, Pieter Bultman, Ryan
Zellefrow, Zach Barrett, Jeremy Tsang, Max Murray, and Mitchell Ringman, and
Whereas, Head Coach Robert Dow, Associate Head Coach Brad Cole, Assistant
Coach Rory Twomey, Goalkeeper Coach Brendan Pulley, Assistant Athletic Performance
Coach Mike Ederer, Athletic Trainer Hannah Tremel, Director of Operations Mack
Walton, and student managers Eli Ross and Eric Bissell were all elated with this amazing
victory, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2024 University of Vermont Catamounts
on winning their school’s first NCAA Division I men’s soccer championship (College
Cup), and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the University of Vermont Athletics Department.
