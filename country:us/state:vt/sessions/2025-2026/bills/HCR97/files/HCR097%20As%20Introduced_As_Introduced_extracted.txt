State of Vermont
House of Representatives
Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 97
House concurrent resolution congratulating the Southern State Correctional Facility’s debate team on
its National Prison Debate League victory over Wake Forest University
Whereas, in an innovative project that Commissioner of Corrections Nicholas Deml described as
“show[ing] the transformative power of education,” the Southern State Correctional Facility (SSCF), in
association with the National Prison Debate League (NPDL), conducted a semester-long, three-college-
credit course instructing the enrollees on the art of collegiate debate, and
Whereas, the NPDL“connects incarcerated individuals with collegiate debate programs, sharpening
critical thinking[,]…spurring creativity[,] reduc[ing] recidivism[,] and, ultimately, reshap[ing]
lives,” and
Whereas, as the exciting course highlight, sixof the SSCF students engaged in a virtually transmitted
debate against a student team from Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and
Whereas, the topic of the debate was the Norwegian Model of Corrections, “which emphasizes
rehabilitation and personal agency,” and each team consulted experts in preparation for the debate, and
Whereas, upon the debate’s completion, a panel of independent judges scored all aspects of each
team’s performance and declared the SSCF team the winner, an outstanding accolade for this
correctional facility team, and
Whereas, this well-deserved victory is attributed both to the SSCF debaters’ dedication and
studiousness and to the NPDL’s intensive four-month curriculum “focused on civic engagement,
empowerment, conflict resolution, research skills, and peer leadership,” and
Whereas, the course’s success reflects NPDLExecutive Director Daniel Throop’s observation that
“there are no inferior minds, only unequal opportunities,” now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the Southern State Correctional Facility’s debate team on
its National Prison Debate League victory over Wake Forest University, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the
Commissioner of Corrections, the Superintendent of the Southern State Correctional Facility, and each
member of the winning team.
