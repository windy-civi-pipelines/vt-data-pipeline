1 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
2 Sec. 1. FINDINGS
3 The General Assembly finds that:
4 (1) Lake Memphremagog is of integral importance to Vermont and
5 Quebec as the lake:
6 (A) is the largest body of water in northeastern Vermont and
7 southeastern Quebec;
8 (B) provides over 175,000 people with drinking water; and
9 (C) is an important economic driver in northeastern Vermont and
10 southeastern Canada, drawing people and resources for its beautiful landscapes
11 and numerous recreational opportunities.
12 (2) Phosphorus runoff is causing or contributing to excessive algal
13 biomass in Lake Memphremagog, impairing the swimming and aesthetic uses
14 of the lake.
15 (3) Phosphorus runoff to Lake Memphremagog is contributing to the
16 more frequent cyanobacteria outbreaks in the lake, which pose threats to public
17 health and natural resources.
18 (4) Vermont must take responsibility for the impairments to Lake
19 Memphremagog as:
20 (A) more than 100 permanent or intermittent tributaries feed Lake
21 Memphremagog, with 71 percent of the watershed located in Vermont; and

1 (B) water quality models indicate that Vermont watersheds contribute
2 a significant majority of the annual phosphorus loading to the lake with
3 116,216 pounds of the total annual load of 151,314 pounds of phosphorus
4 originating in Vermont.
5 (5) Vermont has drafted and begun implementation of a Total Maximum
6 Daily Load plan to address impairment of Lake Memphremagog, and the
7 Agency of Natural Resources has committed to improving water quality in the
8 lake, but more action, attention, and funding is necessary to improve the health
9 of Lake Memphremagog as soon as possible.
10 (6) The General Assembly should declare Lake Memphremagog a lake
11 in crisis and dedicate additional time, money, and action to improve the lake’s
12 water quality as soon as possible to avoid continued threats to the natural
13 resources, drinking water, recreation, and economic benefits provided by the
14 lake.
15 Sec. 2. DECLARATION; LAKE MEMPHREMAGOG; LAKE IN CRISIS
16 Notwithstanding 10 V.S.A. § 1310, the General Assembly declares Lake
17 Memphremagog as a lake in crisis under 10 V.S.A. chapter 47, subchapter 2A.
18 The crisis response plan for Lake Memphremagog shall include controls limits
19 on discharges of effluent to tributaries of the lake.
