2 values to be recommended for the current tax year, and to recommend such
3 changes and improvement in the administration of this subchapter as

10 tax rate for enrolled lands equal to 25 percent of the difference between a
11 parcel’s use value and the grand list value.
12 (b) Annually, on or before October 15, the Board shall hold a public
13 hearing and such other hearings as they deem necessary to receive public
14 testimony on the criteria and values for use value appraisals in the coming tax
15 year and on the administration of this subchapter.
16 (c) Prior to February 15 each year, the Board shall submit to the Director
17 its recommended schedule of criteria and values for use value appraisals for
18 the current tax year. The Director shall then distribute the valuations to all
19 municipalities, towns, and gores, and the assessing officials shall appraise
20 qualifying agricultural and managed forestland at these use values.
