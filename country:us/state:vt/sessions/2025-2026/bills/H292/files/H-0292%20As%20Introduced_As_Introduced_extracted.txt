7 application; sale of
8 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to ban the land
9 application or sale of biosolids, sewage sludge, or similar liquid wastes in
10 which testing indicates the presence of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl
11 substances (PFAS). The bill would also prohibit the landfill disposal of
12 biosolids, sewage sludge, or similar liquid wastes in which PFAS levels exceed
13 the State standards for hazardous waste.
14 An act relating to the land application and sale of biosolids containing
15 PFAS
16 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:

1 (1) “Secretary” means the Secretary of Natural Resources or his or her
2 the Secretary’s duly authorized representative.
3 (2) “Solid waste” means any discarded garbage; refuse; septage; sludge
4 from a waste treatment plant, water supply plant, or pollution control facility;
5 and other discarded material, including solid, liquid, semi-solid semisolid, or
6 contained gaseous materials resulting from industrial, commercial, mining, or
7 agricultural operations and from community activities but does not include
8 animal manure and absorbent bedding used for soil enrichment; high carbon
9 bulking agents used in composting; or solid or dissolved materials in industrial
10 discharges that are point sources subject to permits under the Water Pollution
11 Control Act, chapter 47 of this title.
12 * * *
13 (50) “Biosolids” means septage or sewage sludge derived, in whole or in
14 part, from domestic wastes that have been subjected to a treatment process for
15 the reduction of pathogens and have been demonstrated to meet the applicable
16 requirements in Agency rules for contaminant concentrations, vector attraction
17 reduction, and pathogen reduction.
18 (51) “Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances” or “PFAS” means
19 a class of fluorinated organic chemicals containing at least one fully
20 fluorinated carbon atom.

1 (52) “Septage” means the liquid and solid materials pumped from a
2 septic tank, portable toilet, or cesspool during cleaning.
3 (53) “Sludge” means any solid, semisolid, or liquid generated from a
4 municipal, commercial, or industrial wastewater treatment plant or process,
5 water supply treatment plant, air pollution control facility, or any other such
6 waste having similar characteristics and effects. “Sludge” includes Class A
7 and Class B sewage sludge as those terms are defined under 40 C.F.R.

9 Sec. 2. 10 V.S.A. § 6604b is amended to read:
10 § 6604b. TESTING OF SOLID WASTES PRIOR TO BENEFICIAL USE
11 ON LAND OR DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING
12 (a) The Secretary of Natural Resources, in consultation with the Secretary
13 of Agriculture, Food and Markets and with the Commissioner of Health, shall
14 adopt rules to establish a testing program for all biosolids, sewage sludge, or
15 similar liquid wastes, prior to their beneficial use on land or prior to
16 distribution and marketing of those wastes in liquid or solid form. The testing
17 program shall establish a process for the determination of minimum testing
18 frequencies and specific parameters for which analysis must be completed and
19 shall detail procedures by which samples are collected, stored, and tested.
20 (b) In establishing the process for the determination of test parameters and
21 frequency, the rules shall take into account the size and complexity of the
VT LEG #379377 v.1

1 facility,; the nature of the service area or collection system, including industrial
2 contributions,; the frequency of sewage sludge use on the land,; and any
3 existing data that is pertinent to the facility.
4 (c) Rules regarding the application of waste to fields shall take into
5 consideration the characteristics of the specific waste involved and shall
6 calculate the heavy metal or micronutrient soil holding capacity based on a pH
7 of 5.5 for the soil type at the application site, as appropriate.
8 (d) A person subject to this section shall make all analytical results derived
9 from the testing program provided for in this section available to the public
10 upon request.
11 (e) The Secretary shall test all biosolids, sewage sludge, or similar liquid
12 wastes for the presence of PFAS prior to land application of biosolids, sewage
13 sludge, or similar liquid wastes or prior to sale of biosolids.
14 (f) If PFAS are identified in biosolids, sewage sludge, or similar liquid
15 wastes under the testing required by subsection (e) of this section, a person
16 shall not:
17 (1) land apply the biosolids, sewage sludge, or similar liquid wastes; and
18 (2) sell the biosolids or products containing the biosolids.
19 Sec. 3. 10 V.S.A. § 6621a is amended to read:
20 § 6621a. LANDFILL DISPOSAL REQUIREMENTS
VT LEG #379377 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.292
2025 Page 5 of 5
1 (a) In accordance with the following schedule, no person shall knowingly
2 dispose of the following materials in solid waste or in landfills:
3 * * *
4 (13) Solid waste, landfill leachate, septage, or sludge that has PFAS
5 levels exceeding the State standards for hazardous waste.
6 (b) This section shall not prohibit the designation and use of separate areas
7 at landfills for the storage or processing, or both, of material specified in this
8 section.
9 (c) Insofar as it applies to the operator of a solid waste management
10 facility, the Secretary may suspend the application of this section to material
11 specified in subdivision (a)(2), (3), (4), (5), or (6) of this section, or any
12 combination of these, upon finding that insufficient markets exist and adequate
13 uses are not reasonably available to serve as an alternative to disposal.
14 (d) The landfill disposal ban under subdivisions (a)(9)–(11) of this section
15 shall not apply to mandated recyclables, leaf and yard residuals, or food
16 residuals collected as part of a litter collection event operated or administered
17 by a nonprofit organization or municipality.
18 (e) Sludge shall not be used as daily cover at a landfill operating in the
19 State.
20 Sec. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE
