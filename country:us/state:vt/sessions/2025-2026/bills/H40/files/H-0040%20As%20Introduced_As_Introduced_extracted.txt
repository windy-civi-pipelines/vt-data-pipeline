9 Date:
10 Subject: Health; health care facilities; birth centers; certificate of need; health
11 insurance; Medicaid
12 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to establish a
13 licensing structure for freestanding birth centers and to exempt birth centers
14 from certificate of need review. It would also require prenatal, maternity,
15 postpartum, and newborn coverage under health insurance plans and Medicaid
16 to include birth center services.
17 An act relating to licensure of freestanding birth centers
18 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
19 Sec. 1. PURPOSES
20 (a) The purposes of this act are:
VT LEG #378788 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.40
2025 Page 2 of 10
1 (1) to reduce health care costs;
2 (2) to protect women’s access to prenatal, maternity, birthing,
3 postpartum, and newborn care services; and
4 (3) to ensure women have a choice in how and where they give birth.
5 (b) This act would achieve those purposes by:
6 (1) removing the certificate of need requirement for establishing a
7 freestanding birth center; and
8 (2) licensing and regulating birth centers.
9 Sec. 2. FINDINGS
10 The General Assembly finds that:
11 (1) Vermonters value reproductive rights and equity in health care
12 choices, including the right to give birth in the setting of one’s choice.
13 (2) In Vermont, the only birthing settings that women and families
14 currently have are to have their babies in a hospital or at home.
15 (3) Vermont is one of the last states to ensure access to freestanding
16 birth centers.
17 (4) The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the
18 American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine
19 all endorse the birth center model of care as a safe and evidence-based option
20 for individuals with low-risk pregnancies.
VT LEG #378788 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.40
2025 Page 3 of 10
1 (5) In 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a
2 report on the “Strong Start for Mothers and Newborns” initiative, which found
3 that rates of preterm birth, low birthweight, and cesarean section were lower
4 among Medicaid participants who received care and delivered their babies in a
5 freestanding birth center than those who delivered in a hospital or other non-
6 birth center setting. In addition to better outcomes, the report also found that
7 costs for Medicaid participants who delivered at a birth center were more than
8 $2,000.00 lower per mother-infant pair during birth and the following year
9 than for the Medicaid participants who did not use a birth center.
10 (6) Birth centers are safe, supportive settings in which Vermonters can
11 receive prenatal, maternity, birthing, postpartum, and newborn care services.
12 Nationally, they have demonstrated better outcomes and reduced costs
13 compared with other birthing settings.
14 Sec. 3. 18 V.S.A. § 9435(a) is amended to read:
15 (a) Excluded from this subchapter are offices of physicians, dentists, or
16 other practitioners of the healing arts, meaning the physical places that are
17 occupied by such providers on a regular basis in which such providers perform
18 the range of diagnostic and treatment services usually performed by such
19 providers on an outpatient basis unless they are subject to review under
20 subdivision 9434(a)(4) of this title. The exclusion provisions of this subsection
21 shall also apply to birth centers licensed pursuant to chapter 53 of this title.
