10 An act relating to consumer protections applicable to broadband and VoIP
11 services
12 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
13 * * * Vermont Broadband Consumer Protection and Competition Act * * *
14 Sec. 1. 9 V.S.A. chapter 63, subchapter 10A is added to read:
15 Subchapter 10A. Broadband Consumer Protection and Competition
16 § 2490. TITLE
17 This subchapter shall be known and may be cited as “the Vermont
18 Broadband Consumer Protection and Competition Act.”
VT LEG #378534 v.1

1 § 2490a. PURPOSE
2 The purpose of this subchapter is to promote a thriving broadband market in
3 Vermont free of anticompetitive, unfair, deceptive, or misleading practices in
4 order to protect the public and to encourage fair and honest competition.
5 § 2490b. FINDINGS
6 The General Assembly finds that:
7 (1) Broadband is a critical sector of the overall Vermont economy.
8 (2) Broadband service is essential for supporting economic and
9 educational opportunities; strengthening health and public safety networks; and
10 reinforcing democratic, social, and civic engagement and for allowing
11 Vermonters to benefit from new and innovative internet-based products and
12 services, such as smart home energy-saving technologies.
13 (3) Despite considerable public investments in broadband deployment
14 and service, about 14.95 percent of Vermont locations (47,262 locations) do
15 not have access to high-speed broadband service. Many more do not have
16 access to service from more than one broadband provider.
17 (4) Vermont is a rural state with many geographically remote, sparsely
18 populated locations with no or limited access to public transit systems.
19 (5) Those who live far from a town center or regional commercial hub
20 are particularly disadvantaged by the lack of broadband access. They are
21 burdened with the additional time and expense of traveling great distances to
VT LEG #378534 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.11
2025 Page 3 of 17
1 either access a broadband connection, such as a public Wi-Fi hotspot, or to
2 physically carry out activities they are unable to do from home, such as online
3 banking and telehealth appointments.
4 (6) The critical need for broadband service coupled with the lack of
5 competition, particularly in high-cost areas, creates an imbalance of power
6 between the provider and consumer.
7 (7) The Attorney General, as the chief law enforcement officer in the
8 State, must provide a strong presence in the broadband market and protect and
9 advocate for Vermonters when necessary.
10 (8) All policymakers, law enforcement officers, and regulators must
11 work collaboratively to ensure the market is vibrant, efficient, and competitive
12 and serves as an engine of economic growth and innovation in all four corners
13 of the State.
14 (9) No broadband provider should be permitted to exploit its market
15 position to stifle competition and deprive a consumer of a meaningful choice
16 among broadband providers.
17 (10) Monitoring the broadband market through data collection and
18 analysis will enable State government to identify and respond swiftly and
19 appropriately to market failures or misconduct and promote a healthy
20 economy.
VT LEG #378534 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.11
2025 Page 4 of 17
1 (11) A well-functioning broadband marketplace will foster competition,
2 higher wages, lower prices, better service, more consumer choices, further
3 investment, and increased innovation and entrepreneurship.
4 § 2490c. DEFINITIONS
5 As used in this subchapter:
6 (1) “Broadband provider” or “provider” means a business that provides
7 broadband service to any person in Vermont.
8 (2) “Broadband service” or “broadband” means a mass-market retail
9 service by wire or radio in Vermont that provides the capability to transmit
10 data to and receive data from all or substantially all internet endpoints,
11 including any capabilities that are incidental to and enable the operation of the
12 communications service, but excluding dial-up service.
13 (3) “Consumer” means a person to whom a broadband provider sells
14 broadband service.
15 § 2490d. NET NEUTRALITY
16 Because the free and open flow of information underpins the free and open
17 flow of commerce, beginning on October 1, 2025, a broadband provider shall
18 not sell, offer, or advertise for sale broadband service without a valid
19 certificate of net neutrality compliance from the Secretary of Administration
20 pursuant to 3 V.S.A. § 348.
VT LEG #378534 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.11
2025 Page 5 of 17
1 § 2490e. PROHIBITED PRACTICES
2 (a) It shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice in commerce in
3 violation of section 2453 of this chapter for a broadband provider to engage in
4 any of the following conduct:
5 (1) failing to provide a consumer with broadband service that meets or
6 exceeds the performance characteristics offered and sold to the consumer’s
7 service location;
8 (2) failing to reimburse a consumer any installation costs associated
9 with broadband service that is discontinued by the consumer because the
10 service did not meet or exceed the minimum performance characteristics
11 offered and sold to the consumer’s service location;
12 (3) engaging in marketing or promotional practices that misrepresent the
13 actual terms and conditions of a broadband service plan or tend to mislead or
14 deceive an actual or prospective consumer;
15 (4) imposing excessive termination fees or other burdensome conditions
16 that unfairly restrict a consumer’s ability to discontinue service or purchase
17 service from another provider;
18 (5) charging equipment or service fees that do not reasonably correlate
19 with the cost of the broadband service or equipment provided to a consumer,
20 excluding any State or federal fees;
VT LEG #378534 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.11
2025 Page 6 of 17
1 (6) failing to submit broadband availability data in a form and manner
2 prescribed by the Department of Public Service for the purpose of maintaining
3 the State’s broadband availability maps under 30 V.S.A. § 202e(e);
4 (7) violating privacy, security, or network management practices
5 applicable to its broadband service; or
6 (8) imposing a predatory data cap, as further defined in subsection (b) of
7 this section.
8 (b) A broadband provider shall not impose a data cap except when tailored
9 for the purpose of reasonable network management, such as managing network
10 congestion. For purposes of this section, “data cap” means a limit on the
11 amount of bits or other units of information a broadband consumer may
12 download or upload during a period of time specified by the provider before
13 the consumer:
14 (1) is charged a fee for additional usage;
15 (2) is subject to an increasing cost per bit or other unit of information;
16 (3) is charged for an incremental block of usage;
17 (4) experiences a reduction of access speed; or

4 tracks the number, nature, disposition status, and resolution time of complaints
5 received directly by State government and indirectly from provider records
6 submitted to the Attorney General under subsection (b) of this section.
7 (b) Beginning on January 1, 2026, a broadband provider shall maintain a
8 complete record of any consumer complaints received regarding its broadband
9 service. The record shall include the total number of complaints received, the
10 nature of each complaint, the disposition of each complaint, the time it took to
11 process and resolve each complaint, and any other relevant information
12 requested by the Attorney General. A provider shall submit a copy of the
13 record of complaints for the preceding year to the Office of the Attorney
14 General annually, beginning on January 1, 2027.
15 (c) As used in this section, “complaint” means any communication
16 primarily expressing a grievance.
17 § 2490g. MONITORING COMPETITION AND PRACTICES
18 (a) The Attorney General shall routinely monitor current and emerging
19 market trends and business practices in the broadband sector and assess their
20 effect, positive or negative, on consumers, workers, businesses, and the
21 broader Vermont economy.

1 (b) Factors to be considered by the Attorney General under this section
2 include the number of broadband providers actively engaged in providing
3 broadband service, market share, ease of market entry, industry consolidation,
4 and any other factors the Attorney General deems relevant to a market
5 analysis.
6 (c) The Attorney General shall periodically review and compare a
7 provider’s broadband consumer label for multiple service locations in the
8 provider’s market area. For purposes of this subsection, “broadband consumer
9 label” means the label required to be provided to a consumer at the point of
10 sale, pursuant to the Federal Communications Commission’s Broadband
11 Labels Order, 37 FCC Rcd 13686, 13687, 13689-90, 13696, paras. 3, 12, 35
12 (2022).
13 (d) The Attorney General shall review provider business practices,
14 including data practices, as appropriate, to determine whether any practices
15 negatively affect marginalized or underserved communities or worsen
16 disparities and inequities in the social and economic fabric of our State.
17 (e)(1) To assist the Attorney General with carrying out the purposes of this
18 section, on or before October 1, 2025, and annually thereafter, each broadband
19 provider shall submit a report to the Attorney General, which includes the

4 made, is false or misleading in a material respect; or
5 (B) is false or misleading due to the omission of a material fact.
6 (4) The accuracy of the information included in the report shall be
7 verified by oath of two of the provider’s executive officers, under penalty of
8 perjury.

9 event that will cause financial hardship and the inability of consumers to pay
10 for broadband services.
11 (b) For purposes of this section, a price is unconscionably high if:
12 (1) there is a gross disparity between the price charged during the
13 emergency or seven days prior to the emergency and the price at which the
14 same service was sold or offered for sale in the usual course of business
15 immediately prior to the state of emergency; and

10 An act relating to consumer protections applicable to broadband and VoIP
11 services
12 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
13 * * * Vermont Broadband Consumer Protection and Competition Act * * *
14 Sec. 1. 9 V.S.A. chapter 63, subchapter 10A is added to read:
15 Subchapter 10A. Broadband Consumer Protection and Competition
16 § 2490. TITLE
17 This subchapter shall be known and may be cited as “the Vermont
18 Broadband Consumer Protection and Competition Act.”
VT LEG #378534 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.11

1 § 2490a. PURPOSE
2 The purpose of this subchapter is to promote a thriving broadband market in
3 Vermont free of anticompetitive, unfair, deceptive, or misleading practices in
4 order to protect the public and to encourage fair and honest competition.
5 § 2490b. FINDINGS
6 The General Assembly finds that:
7 (1) Broadband is a critical sector of the overall Vermont economy.
8 (2) Broadband service is essential for supporting economic and
9 educational opportunities; strengthening health and public safety networks; and
10 reinforcing democratic, social, and civic engagement and for allowing
11 Vermonters to benefit from new and innovative internet-based products and
12 services, such as smart home energy-saving technologies.
13 (3) Despite considerable public investments in broadband deployment
14 and service, about 14.95 percent of Vermont locations (47,262 locations) do
15 not have access to high-speed broadband service. Many more do not have
16 access to service from more than one broadband provider.
17 (4) Vermont is a rural state with many geographically remote, sparsely
18 populated locations with no or limited access to public transit systems.
19 (5) Those who live far from a town center or regional commercial hub
20 are particularly disadvantaged by the lack of broadband access. They are
21 burdened with the additional time and expense of traveling great distances to
VT LEG #378534 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.11
2025 Page 3 of 17
1 either access a broadband connection, such as a public Wi-Fi hotspot, or to
2 physically carry out activities they are unable to do from home, such as online
3 banking and telehealth appointments.
4 (6) The critical need for broadband service coupled with the lack of
5 competition, particularly in high-cost areas, creates an imbalance of power
6 between the provider and consumer.
7 (7) The Attorney General, as the chief law enforcement officer in the
8 State, must provide a strong presence in the broadband market and protect and
9 advocate for Vermonters when necessary.
10 (8) All policymakers, law enforcement officers, and regulators must
11 work collaboratively to ensure the market is vibrant, efficient, and competitive
12 and serves as an engine of economic growth and innovation in all four corners
13 of the State.
14 (9) No broadband provider should be permitted to exploit its market
15 position to stifle competition and deprive a consumer of a meaningful choice
16 among broadband providers.
17 (10) Monitoring the broadband market through data collection and
18 analysis will enable State government to identify and respond swiftly and
19 appropriately to market failures or misconduct and promote a healthy
20 economy.
VT LEG #378534 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.11
2025 Page 4 of 17
1 (11) A well-functioning broadband marketplace will foster competition,
2 higher wages, lower prices, better service, more consumer choices, further
3 investment, and increased innovation and entrepreneurship.
4 § 2490c. DEFINITIONS
5 As used in this subchapter:
6 (1) “Broadband provider” or “provider” means a business that provides
7 broadband service to any person in Vermont.
8 (2) “Broadband service” or “broadband” means a mass-market retail
9 service by wire or radio in Vermont that provides the capability to transmit
10 data to and receive data from all or substantially all internet endpoints,
11 including any capabilities that are incidental to and enable the operation of the
12 communications service, but excluding dial-up service.
13 (3) “Consumer” means a person to whom a broadband provider sells
14 broadband service.
15 § 2490d. NET NEUTRALITY
16 Because the free and open flow of information underpins the free and open
