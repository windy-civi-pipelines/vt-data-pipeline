State of Vermont
House of Representatives
Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 114
Offered by Representative Charlton of Chester
House concurrent resolution honoring Deborah J. Aldrich for 42 years of extraordinary municipal public
service in the Town of Chester
Whereas, for over four decades, the citizens of the Town of Chester appreciated the outstanding job
performance of its former Assistant Town Clerk and Town Clerk/Treasurer Deborah Aldrich, and
Whereas, in 1983, Chester Town Clerk Sandy Walker took a chance on an applicant for the position of
Chester Assistant Town Clerk, named Deborah Aldrich, who, at 22 years of age, was untested but proved to be
an ideal choice, and
Whereas, Deborah Aldrich consistently approached her work with a desire to be helpful; performed her
duties in an efficient, knowledgeable, and timely manner; and was always good-humored, even when
confronted with a less amiable individual at the town clerk’s desk, and
Whereas, in 2005, the by-then highly experienced Deborah Aldrich successfully stood for election in her
own right as Chester Town Clerk/Treasurer, and
Whereas, she brought 22 years of experience to her new job and, to no one’s surprise, oversaw a well-
managed town clerk’s office, ensuring that election administration proceeded smoothly; deeds were recorded as
required; and, most importantly for many, the trash ticket sales kept apace, and
Whereas, Deborah Aldrich has worked cooperatively and effectively with four town managers, a bevy of
selectboard members, and perhaps more justices of the peace than are easily enumerated, and
Whereas, her career epitomizes the ideal Vermont Town Clerk/Treasurer, and she served as a great role
model for her colleagues across the State, and
Whereas, on Town Meeting Day 2025, Deborah Aldrich concluded her service as Chester Town Clerk but,
fortunately for the community, has agreed to continue serving as town treasurer, and in recognition of her stellar
tenure, a glowing tribute was published in this year’s Chester Town Report, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly honors Deborah J. Aldrich for 42 years of extraordinary municipal public service
in the Town of Chester, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to Deborah Aldrich.
