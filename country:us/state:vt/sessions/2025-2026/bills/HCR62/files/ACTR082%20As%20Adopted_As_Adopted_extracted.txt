Black Music Division at Bennington College.
(H.C.R.62)
Offered by Representatives Greer of Bennington, Cooper of Pownal, Corcoran of
Bennington, Durfee of Shaftsbury, Morrissey of Bennington, and Nigro of Bennington
Offered by Senators Bongartz and Plunkett
Whereas, the journey to establish Black music as a focus of academic examination and
respect owes much to the pioneering initiative of the Black Music Division at Bennington
College, which was established in 1974 under the auspices of Bill Dixon, a Renaissance
figure in the Black cultural scene, as a composer, educator, performer, and ardent artistic
advocate, and
Whereas, this avant-garde jazz luminary was ideally qualified to take on this
pedagogical challenge, having studied music at the Hartnett Conservatory of Music,
organized the “October Revolution in Jazz” conclave in New York City in 1964, and later
co-founded the Jazz Composer’s Guild, and
Whereas, a primary rationale for the creation of the Black Music Division was “to
legitimize Black Music within the academic sphere,” a mission today’s faculty continues
to promote with “courses that explore the depth and cultural significance of Black
music,” and
Whereas, for nearly four decades, another prominent faculty member in the Black
Music Division was the eminent percussionist, New York Art Quartet member,
Guggenheim Fellowship recipient, and Doris Duke Foundation Impact Award winner,
Milford Graves, and
Whereas, to celebrate and reflect upon this half-century academic odyssey and its
historic and “transformative impact on the field of music, education, improvisation and
culture,” the Black Music Division, with the support of Bennington College Alumni
Relations, is sponsoring a Black Music Symposium, an event reminiscent of Bill Dixon’s
“October Revolution in Jazz,” and
Whereas, Bennington College faculty member Michael Wimberly is organizing this
grand gathering of “alumni, musicians, faculty, students, and members of the public” for
two glorious days of exciting “live performances, lectures, panels, and workshops” that
will highlight the past, present, and future of Black music, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly commemorates the 50th anniversary of the Black Music
Division at Bennington College, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the Black Music Division at Bennington College.
