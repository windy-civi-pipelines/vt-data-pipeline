Section 1:
State of Vermont
House of Representatives
Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 62
Shaftsbury, Morrissey of Bennington, and Nigro of Bennington
Offered by Senators Bongartz and Plunkett
House concurrent resolution commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Black Music Division at
Bennington College
Whereas, the journey to establish Black music as a focus of academic examination and respect owes much to
the pioneering initiative of the Black Music Division at Bennington College, which was established in 1974
under the auspices of Bill Dixon, a Renaissance figure in the Black cultural scene, as a composer, educator,
performer, and ardent artistic advocate, and
Whereas, this avant-garde jazz luminary was ideally qualified to take on this pedagogical challenge, having
studied music at the Hartnett Conservatory of Music, organized the “October Revolution in Jazz” conclave in
New York City in 1964, and later co-founded the Jazz Composer’s Guild, and
Whereas, a primary rationale for the creation of the Black Music Division was “to legitimize Black Music
within the academic sphere,” a mission today’s faculty continues to promote with “courses that explore the
depth and cultural significance of Black music,” and
Whereas, for nearly four decades, another prominent faculty member in the Black Music Division was the
eminent percussionist, New York Art Quartet member, Guggenheim Fellowship recipient, and Doris Duke
Foundation Impact Award winner, Milford Graves, and
Whereas, to celebrate and reflect upon this half-century academic odyssey and its historic and
“transformative impact on the field of music, education, improvisation and culture,” the Black Music Division,
with the support of Bennington College Alumni Relations, is sponsoring a Black Music Symposium, an event
reminiscent of Bill Dixon’s “October Revolution in Jazz,” and
Whereas, Bennington College faculty member Michael Wimberly is organizing this grand gathering of
“alumni, musicians, faculty, students, and members of the public” for two glorious days of exciting “live
performances, lectures, panels, and workshops” that will highlight the past, present, and future of Black music,
now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly commemorates the 50th anniversary of the Black Music Division at Bennington
College, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the Black Music
Division at Bennington College.
