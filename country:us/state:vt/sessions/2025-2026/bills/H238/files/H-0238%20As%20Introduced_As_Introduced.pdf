3 Montpelier
4 Referred to Committee on
5 Date:
6 Subject: Conservation and development; toxic substances; consumer products;
7 perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances
8 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to phase out and
9 ultimately prohibit the manufacture, sale, or distribution for sale of consumer
10 products containing added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances
11 (PFAS). The bill would authorize both the Secretary of Natural Resources and
12 the Attorney General to enforce the requirements for consumer products
13 containing PFAS, with the Attorney General enforcing under consumer
14 protection laws. In addition, a consumer harmed by a consumer product
15 containing PFAS would be authorized to bring a consumer protection action
16 for damages.
17 An act relating to the phaseout of consumer products containing added
18 perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances
