and later brought this professional expertise to her service on the board of Northwest
Fiberworx, the Communications Union District serving Franklin and Grand Isle
Counties, and

gubernatorial campaign, and she completed the Emerge Vermont candidate training
program, and also served on the organization’s board, and
Whereas, as the legislative liaison for the LGBTQIA Alliance of Vermont, her efforts
were critical in legislative enactments related to ethnic and social equity studies in public
schools; the provision of gender-neutral bathrooms; adding a non-binary designation
option for Vermont drivers’ licenses; and establishing a birth certificate authentication
process, and
Whereas, Brenda Churchill’s interests also focused on municipal government in the
Town of Bakersfield, where she served as a zoning official and the local American
