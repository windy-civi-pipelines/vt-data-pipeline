State of Vermont
House of Representatives
Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 33
Offered by Representatives Masland of Thetford and Holcombe of Norwich
House concurrent resolution honoring criminal defense and personal injury attorney and Thetford Academy
indoor track coach Charles Buttrey of Thetford
Whereas, Charlie Buttrey of Thetford graduated from Vermont Law and Graduate School, and he initially
practiced law in Norwich before moving his professional life across the Connecticut River to Lebanon, New
Hampshire, where he joined the law firm now known as Schuster, Buttrey, and Wing, and
Whereas, the focus of his legal career has been as a criminal defense attorney who participates in New
Hampshire’s public defender conflict program, and this entrée provides him a clientele consisting largely of
persons who are frequently indigent and who society has often written off, and
Whereas, a creative advocate in the courtroom, he employs ingenuity and spirited argument to spare his
clients from being imprisoned or paying fines, and he finds it sobering that the U.S. Department of Justice
reports that, in both New Hampshire and Vermont, 40 percent of the released prison population is
reincarcerated within three years, and
Whereas, although his professional passion is the criminal defense side of his practice, to which he devotes
80 percent of his time as a lawyer, the other 20 percent, composed of personal injury law cases, is essential to
the financial viability of his career, and in pursuit of these clients, Charlie Buttrey has aired attention-grabbing
television advertisements, featuring persons whose activities could lead to injuries, including a skydiver, a
character he personally portrayed, accompanied with the catchy tagline, “Not Just Another Lawyer,” and
Whereas, away from the courtroom drama, Charlie Buttrey enjoys fulfilling an equally satisfying role as the
Thetford Academy boys’ indoor track coach, and in 2025, the athletes under his wise guidance convincingly
clinched the Division II championship, and in a desire to pursue a scholarly interest, he recently earned a
graduate degree in theology from Boston University, and
Whereas, after 38 years as a member of the bar, Charlie Buttrey has decided to step aside from the active
practice of law but intends to remain a vigilant warrior for criminal justice reform through volunteering with
Orange County’s Restorative Justice Center and advocating at both the New Hampshire and Vermont State
Houses to eliminate life without parole criminal sentences, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly honors criminal defense and personal injury attorney and Thetford Academy
indoor track coach Charles Buttrey of Thetford, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to Charlie Buttrey.
