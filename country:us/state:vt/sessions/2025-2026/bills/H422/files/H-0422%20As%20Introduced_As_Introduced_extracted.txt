3 Holcombe of Norwich, and Olson of Starksboro
4 Referred to Committee on
5 Date:
6 Subject: Conservation and development; solid waste; landfills; groundwater
7 monitoring; laboratory testing
8 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to require the
9 Secretary of Natural Resources to require the testing of groundwater samples at
10 the State Agricultural and Environmental Laboratory (State Laboratory) when
11 sampling occurs at a site where hazardous materials were released. Testing at
12 the State Laboratory would not be required if the State Laboratory lacks the
13 ability to conduct the necessary testing, or, when approved by the Secretary of
14 Natural Resources, testing at a private laboratory would result in significant
15 costs savings to the State or the owner of the contaminated site.
16 An act relating to testing of groundwater samples from contaminated sites at
17 the State Agricultural and Environmental Laboratory
18 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
19 Sec. 1. FINDINGS
20 The General Assembly finds that:
VT LEG #381096 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.422
2025 Page 2 of 4
1 (1) groundwater testing in proximity to sites contaminated by hazardous
2 materials is critically important to protecting public and private water supply
3 sources;
4 (2) high-quality laboratory analysis of water samples from groundwater
5 monitoring wells at contaminated sites must be a mandatory component of
6 oversight of the monitoring of contaminated sites;
7 (3) at contaminated sites where a post closure fund is available to pay
8 for groundwater monitoring, it is in the best interests of the State and the entity
9 responsible for the site to keep the cost of groundwater testing low so as to
10 ensure that the cost of groundwater monitoring will not exhaust funding
11 available from the post closure fund;
12 (4) using the State Agricultural and Environmental Laboratory (State
13 Laboratory) to conduct the testing of groundwater samples from contaminated
14 sites assists in keeping monitoring costs lower than if testing of samples
15 occurred at private laboratories;
16 (5) the State and all water users that might be affected by contamination
17 in their drinking water supply will benefit from timely, affordable, and
18 accurate groundwater testing data; and
19 (6) the State, through the Agency of Natural Resources, should require
20 and facilitate the testing of groundwater samples from contaminated sites at the
21 State Laboratory in order to allow for the lowest cost possible for testing.

2 § 6608. RECORDS; REPORTS; MONITORING
3 (a) For purposes of implementation of this chapter, the Secretary shall
4 adopt, and revise as appropriate, rules that prescribe:
5 (1) the establishment and maintenance of such records;
6 (2) the making of such reports;
7 (3) the taking of such samples, and the performing of such tests or
8 analyses;
9 (4) the installing, calibrating, using, and maintaining of such monitoring
10 equipment or methods; and
11 (5) the providing of such other information as may be necessary.

13 (g) When the Secretary under this chapter requires groundwater monitoring
14 of a site where hazardous materials were released, the Secretary shall require
15 that the testing of groundwater samples from the contaminated site occurs at
16 the State Agricultural and Environmental Laboratory unless:
17 (1) the State Agricultural and Environmental Laboratory lacks the
18 ability to conduct the necessary testing; or
19 (2) testing at a private laboratory would result in significant costs
20 savings to the State or the owner of the contaminated site, as approved by the
21 Secretary.
