1 (3) Whenever a controller makes a material change to the controller’s
2 privacy notice or practices, the controller must notify consumers affected by

4 and provide a reasonable opportunity for consumers to withdraw consent to

1 (g) The method or methods under subdivision (f)(1)(J) of this section for
2 submitting a consumer’s request to a controller must:
3 (1) take into account the ways in which consumers normally interact
4 with the controller, the need for security and reliability in communications
5 related to the request, and the controller’s ability to authenticate the identity of
6 the consumer that makes the request;
7 (2) provide a clear and conspicuous link to a website where the
8 consumer or an authorized agent may opt out from a controller’s processing of
9 the consumer’s personal data pursuant to subdivision 2418(a)(7) of this title or,
10 solely if the controller does not have a capacity needed for linking to a web
11 page, provide another method the consumer can use to opt out, which may
12 include an internet hyperlink clearly labeled “Your Opt-Out Rights” or “Your
13 Privacy Rights” that directly effectuates the opt-out request or takes consumers
14 to a web page where the consumer can make the opt-out request; and
15 (3) allow a consumer or authorized agent to send a signal to the
16 controller that indicates the consumer’s preference to opt out of the sale of
17 personal data or targeted advertising pursuant to subdivision 2418(a)(7) of this

19 (A) is consumer friendly and easy for an average consumer to use;
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.71
2025 Page 41 of 89
1 (B)(i) enables the controller to reasonably determine whether the
2 consumer has made a legitimate request pursuant to subsection 2418(b) of this
3 title to opt out pursuant to subdivision 2418(a)(7) of this title; and
4 (ii) for purposes of subdivision (i) of this subdivision (B), use of

8 (f)(1)(J) of this section to opt out of a controller’s processing of the
9 consumer’s personal data pursuant to subdivision 2418(a)(7) of this title and
10 the decision conflicts with a consumer’s existing controller-specific privacy
11 setting or voluntary participation in a bona fide reward, club card, or loyalty
12 program or a program that provides premium features or discounts, the
13 controller shall comply with the consumer’s opt-out preference signal but may
14 notify the consumer of the conflict and provide to the consumer the choice to
15 confirm the controller-specific privacy setting or participation in the program.
16 § 2420. DUTIES OF PROCESSORS

15 consumers;
16 (B) financial, physical, or reputational injury to consumers;
17 (C) a physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the

8 stakeholders, and the public against the potential risks to the consumer
9 associated with the processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can be
10 employed by the controller to reduce the risks.
11 (2) The controller shall factor into any data protection assessment the
12 use of de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well
13 as the context of the processing and the relationship between the controller and
14 the consumer whose personal data will be processed.
15 (c)(1) The Attorney General may require that a controller disclose any data
16 protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the
17 Attorney General pursuant to section 2424 of this title, and the controller shall

12 section if the data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and
13 effect to the data protection assessment that would otherwise be conducted
14 pursuant to this section.
15 (f) A controller shall update the data protection assessment as often as
16 appropriate considering the type, amount, and sensitivity of personal data
17 collected or processed and level of risk presented by the processing throughout
18 the processing activity’s lifecycle in order to:

communication of the requests, and the ability of the controller to verify the
identity of the consumer making the request.
(3) A controller shall not require a consumer to create a new account in
order to exercise consumer rights but may require a consumer to use an
existing account.
(4)(A) The means shall include:
(i) providing a clear and conspicuous link on the controller’s
website to an web page that enables a consumer, or an agent of the consumer,
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.71
2025 Page 79 of 89
to opt out of the targeted advertising or sale of the consumer’s personal data;
and
(ii) not later than January 1, 2026, allowing a consumer to opt
out of any processing of the consumer’s personal data for the purposes of
targeted advertising, or any sale of the personal data, through an opt-out
preference signal sent to the controller with the consumer’s consent indicating
the consumer’s intent to opt out of any the processing or sale, by a platform,
technology, or other mechanism that shall:
(I) not unfairly disadvantage another controller;
(II) not make use of a default setting, but rather require the
consumer to make an affirmative, freely given, and unambiguous choice to opt
out of any processing of the consumer’s personal data pursuant to this
chapter;
(III) be consumer-friendly and easy to use by the average
consumer;
(IV) be as consistent as possible with any other similar
platform, technology, or mechanism required by any federal or State law or
regulation; and
(V) enable the controller to accurately determine whether the
consumer is a resident of this State and whether the consumer has made a
legitimate request to opt out of any sale of the consumer’s personal data or
targeted advertising.
(B) If a consumer’s decision to opt out of any processing of the
consumer’s personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, or any sale
of the personal data, through an opt-out preference signal sent in accordance
with the provisions of subdivision (A) of this subdivision (e)(4) conflicts with
the consumer’s existing controller-specific privacy setting or voluntary
participation in a controller’s bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features,
discounts, or club card program, the controller shall comply with the
consumer’s opt-out preference signal but may notify the consumer of the
conflict and provide to the consumer the choice to confirm the controller-
specific privacy setting or participation in the program.
(5) If a controller responds to consumer opt-out requests received
pursuant to subdivision (4)(A) of this subsection by informing the consumer of
a charge for the use of any product or service, the controller shall present the
terms of any financial incentive offered pursuant to subsection (b) of this

Section 12:
section for the retention, use, sale, or sharing of the consumer’s personal data.

Section 13:
§ 2421. PROCESSORS’ DUTIES; CONTRACTS BETWEEN
CONTROLLERS AND PROCESSORS
(a) A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall
assist the controller in meeting the controller’s obligations under this chapter,
including:
(1) taking into account the nature of processing and the information
available to the processor, by appropriate technical and organizational
measures, to the extent reasonably practicable, to fulfill the controller’s
obligation to respond to consumer rights requests;
(2) taking into account the nature of processing and the information
available to the processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the
controller’s obligations in relation to the security of processing the personal
data and in relation to the notification of a data broker security breach or
security breach, as defined in section 2430 of this title, of the system of the
processor, in order to meet the controller’s obligations; and
(3) providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct
and document data protection assessments.
(b)(1) A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the
processor’s data processing procedures with respect to processing performed
on behalf of the controller.
(2) The contract shall be binding and clearly set forth instructions for
processing data, the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject
to processing, the duration of processing, and the rights and obligations of
both parties.
(3) The contract shall require that the processor:
(A) ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a
duty of confidentiality with respect to the data;
(B) at the controller’s direction, delete or return all personal data to
the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless
retention of the personal data is required by law;
(C) upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to
the controller all information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the
processor’s compliance with the obligations in this chapter;
(D) after providing the controller an opportunity to object, engage
any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract that requires the
subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the
personal data; and
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.71
2025 Page 81 of 89
(E) make available to the controller upon the reasonable request of
the controller, all information in the processor’s possession necessary to
demonstrate the processor’s compliance with this chapter.
(4) A processor shall provide a report of an assessment to the controller
upon request.
(c) This section shall not be construed to relieve a controller or processor
from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by virtue of the
controller’s or processor’s role in the processing relationship, as described in
this chapter.
(d)(1) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor
with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that
depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed.
(2) A person who is not limited in the person’s processing of personal
data pursuant to a controller’s instructions, or who fails to adhere to the
instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to a specific
processing of data.
(3) A processor that continues to adhere to a controller’s instructions
with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor.
(4) If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the
purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor is a
controller with respect to the processing and may be subject to an enforcement
action under section 2425 of this title.

Section 14:
§ 2422. CONTROLLERS’ DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENTS;
DISCLOSURE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL
(a) A controller shall conduct and document a data protection assessment
for each of the controller’s processing activities that presents a heightened risk
of harm to a consumer, which for the purposes of this section includes:
(1) the processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted
advertising;
(2) the sale of personal data;
(3) the processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, where
the profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:
(A) unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on,
consumers;
(B) financial, physical, or reputational injury to consumers;
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.71
2025 Page 82 of 89
(C) a physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or
the private affairs or concerns, of consumers, where the intrusion would be
offensive to a reasonable person; or
(D) other substantial injury to consumers; and
(4) the processing of sensitive data.
(b)(1) Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (a) of
this section shall identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and
indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other
stakeholders, and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the
consumer associated with the processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can
be employed by the controller to reduce the risks.
(2) The controller shall factor into any data protection assessment the
use of de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well
as the context of the processing and the relationship between the controller and
the consumer whose personal data will be processed.
(c)(1) The Attorney General may require that a controller disclose any data
protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the
Attorney General, and the controller shall make the data protection assessment
available to the Attorney General.
(2) The Attorney General may evaluate the data protection assessment
for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in this chapter.
(3) Data protection assessments shall be confidential and shall be
exempt from disclosure and copying under the Public Records Act.
(4) To the extent any information contained in a data protection
assessment disclosed to the Attorney General includes information subject to
attorney-client privilege or work product protection, the disclosure shall not
constitute a waiver of the privilege or protection.
(d) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of
processing operations that include similar activities.
(e) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of
complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection
assessment shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements established in this

Section 15:
section if the data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and
effect to the data protection assessment that would otherwise be conducted
pursuant to this section.
(f) Data protection assessment requirements shall apply to processing
activities created or generated after July 1, 2025 and are not retroactive.

Section 16:
§ 2423. DE-IDENTIFIED AND PSEUDONYMOUS DATA;
CONTROLLERS’ DUTIES; EXCEPTIONS; APPLICABILITY OF
CONSUMERS’ RIGHTS; DISCLOSURE AND OVERSIGHT
(a) A controller in possession of de-identified data shall:
(1) take reasonable measures to ensure that the data cannot be
associated with an individual;
(2) publicly commit to maintaining and using de-identified data without
attempting to re-identify the data; and
(3) contractually obligate any recipients of the de-identified data to
comply with the provisions of this chapter.
(b) This chapter shall not be construed to:
(1) require a controller or processor to re-identify de-identified data or
pseudonymous data; or
(2) maintain data in identifiable form, or collect, obtain, retain, or
access any data or technology, in order to be capable of associating an
authenticated consumer request with personal data.
(c) This chapter shall not be construed to require a controller or processor
to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if the controller:
(1) is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the
personal data or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to
associate the request with the personal data;
(2) does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the specific
consumer who is the subject of the personal data, or associate the personal
data with other personal data about the same specific consumer; and
(3) does not sell the personal data to any third party or otherwise
voluntarily disclose the personal data to any third party other than a processor,
except as otherwise permitted in this section.
(d) The rights afforded under subdivisions 2418(a)(1)–(4) of this title shall
not apply to pseudonymous data in cases where the controller is able to
demonstrate that any information necessary to identify the consumer is kept
separately and is subject to effective technical and organizational controls that
prevent the controller from accessing the information.
(e) A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or de-identified data
shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any
contractual commitments to which the pseudonymous data or de-identified
data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to address any breaches of
those contractual commitments.

identity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious, or deceptive activities or any
illegal activity; preserve the integrity or security of systems; or investigate,
report, or prosecute those responsible for the action;
(10) engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific or statistical research
in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy
laws and is approved, monitored, and governed by an institutional review
board that determines, or similar independent oversight entities that
determine:
(A) whether the deletion of the information is likely to provide
substantial benefits that do not exclusively accrue to the controller;
(B) the expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks;
and
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.71
2025 Page 85 of 89
(C) whether the controller or consumer health data controller has
implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate privacy risks associated with
research, including any risks associated with re-identification;
(11) assist another controller, processor, consumer health data
controller, or third party with any of the obligations under this chapter; or

of the consumer whose personal data is being processed; and
(B) under the responsibility of a professional subject to
confidentiality obligations under federal, state, or local law.

the provision of a product or service specifically requested by a consumer or
the performance of a contract to which the consumer is a party.

health data controllers under this chapter shall not apply where compliance by
the controller, processor, or consumer health data controller with this chapter
would violate an evidentiary privilege under the laws of this State.

processor, or consumer health data controller from providing personal data
concerning a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under
the laws of the State as part of a privileged communication.

consumer health data controller disclosed the personal data, the disclosing
controller, processor, or consumer health data controller did not have actual
knowledge that the receiving processor or third-party controller would violate
this chapter.
(2) A third-party controller or processor receiving personal data from a
controller, processor, or consumer health data controller in compliance with

controller, processor, or consumer health data controller from which the third-
party controller or processor receives the personal data.
(e) This chapter shall not be construed to:
(1) impose any obligation on a controller or processor that adversely
affects the rights or freedoms of any person, including the rights of any person:

1 (3) Whenever a controller makes a material change to the controller’s
2 privacy notice or practices, the controller must notify consumers affected by
3 the material change with respect to any prospectively collected personal data
4 and provide a reasonable opportunity for consumers to withdraw consent to
5 any further materially different transfer of previously collected personal data

2025 Page 40 of 89
1 (g) The method or methods under subdivision (f)(1)(J) of this section for
2 submitting a consumer’s request to a controller must:
3 (1) take into account the ways in which consumers normally interact
4 with the controller, the need for security and reliability in communications
5 related to the request, and the controller’s ability to authenticate the identity of
6 the consumer that makes the request;
7 (2) provide a clear and conspicuous link to a website where the
8 consumer or an authorized agent may opt out from a controller’s processing of
9 the consumer’s personal data pursuant to subdivision 2418(a)(7) of this title or,
10 solely if the controller does not have a capacity needed for linking to a web
11 page, provide another method the consumer can use to opt out, which may
12 include an internet hyperlink clearly labeled “Your Opt-Out Rights” or “Your
13 Privacy Rights” that directly effectuates the opt-out request or takes consumers
14 to a web page where the consumer can make the opt-out request; and
15 (3) allow a consumer or authorized agent to send a signal to the
16 controller that indicates the consumer’s preference to opt out of the sale of

1 (B)(i) enables the controller to reasonably determine whether the
2 consumer has made a legitimate request pursuant to subsection 2418(b) of this
3 title to opt out pursuant to subdivision 2418(a)(7) of this title; and

5 an internet protocol address to estimate the consumer’s location may be
6 considered sufficient to accurately determine residency.
7 (h) If a consumer or authorized agent uses a method under subdivision
8 (f)(1)(J) of this section to opt out of a controller’s processing of the
9 consumer’s personal data pursuant to subdivision 2418(a)(7) of this title and
10 the decision conflicts with a consumer’s existing controller-specific privacy
11 setting or voluntary participation in a bona fide reward, club card, or loyalty
12 program or a program that provides premium features or discounts, the
13 controller shall comply with the consumer’s opt-out preference signal but may
14 notify the consumer of the conflict and provide to the consumer the choice to
15 confirm the controller-specific privacy setting or participation in the program.
16 § 2420. DUTIES OF PROCESSORS
17 (a) A processor shall adhere to a controller’s instructions and shall assist
18 the controller in meeting the controller’s obligations under this chapter. In

6 controller’s request, all information the controller needs to verify that the
7 processor has complied with all obligations the processor has under this

17 with the processor’s obligations under this chapter;
18 (B) require the processor to cooperate with the assessment; and
19 (C) at the controller’s request, report the results of the assessment to
20 the controller;

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.71

1 (9) prohibit the processor from combining personal data obtained from
2 the controller with personal data that the processor:
3 (A) receives from or on behalf of another controller or person; or
4 (B) collects directly from an individual; and
5 (10) require the processor to adhere to equivalent or greater de-
6 identification standards.
7 (c) This section does not relieve a controller or processor from any liability
8 that accrues under this chapter as a result of the controller’s or processor’s
9 actions in processing personal data.
10 (d)(1) For purposes of determining obligations under this chapter, a person
11 is a controller with respect to processing a set of personal data and is subject to
12 an action under section 2424 of this title to punish a violation of this chapter, if
13 the person:
14 (A) does not adhere to a controller’s instructions to process the
15 personal data; or
16 (B) begins at any point to determine the purposes and means for
17 processing the personal data, alone or in concert with another person.
18 (2) A determination under this subsection is a fact-based determination
19 that must take account of the context in which a set of personal data is
20 processed.

3 § 2421. DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENTS FOR PROCESSING
4 ACTIVITIES THAT PRESENT A HEIGHTENED RISK OF HARM
5 TO A CONSUMER
6 (a) A controller shall conduct and document a data protection assessment
7 for each of the controller’s processing activities that presents a heightened risk

9 (1) the processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted
10 advertising;
11 (2) the sale of personal data;

15 consumers;
16 (B) financial, physical, or reputational injury to consumers;
17 (C) a physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the

21 (4) the processing of sensitive data.

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.71
2025 Page 46 of 89
1 (b)(1) Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (a) of
2 this section shall:
3 (A) identify the categories of personal data processed, the purposes
4 for processing the personal data, and whether the personal data is being
5 transferred to third parties; and
6 (B) identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and
7 indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other
8 stakeholders, and the public against the potential risks to the consumer
9 associated with the processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can be
10 employed by the controller to reduce the risks.
11 (2) The controller shall factor into any data protection assessment the
12 use of de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well
13 as the context of the processing and the relationship between the controller and
14 the consumer whose personal data will be processed.
15 (c)(1) The Attorney General may require that a controller disclose any data
16 protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the
17 Attorney General pursuant to section 2424 of this title, and the controller shall
18 make the data protection assessment available to the Attorney General.
19 (2) The Attorney General may evaluate the data protection assessment
20 for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in this chapter.

2 exempt from disclosure and copying under the Public Records Act.
3 (4) To the extent any information contained in a data protection
4 assessment disclosed to the Attorney General includes information subject to
5 attorney-client privilege or work product protection, the disclosure shall not
6 constitute a waiver of the privilege or protection.
7 (d) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of
8 processing operations that present a similar heightened risk of harm.
9 (e) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of
10 complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection
11 assessment shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements established in this
12 section if the data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and
13 effect to the data protection assessment that would otherwise be conducted
14 pursuant to this section.
15 (f) A controller shall update the data protection assessment as often as
16 appropriate considering the type, amount, and sensitivity of personal data
17 collected or processed and level of risk presented by the processing throughout
18 the processing activity’s lifecycle in order to:
19 (1) monitor for harm caused by the processing and adjust safeguards
20 accordingly; and

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.71
2025 Page 48 of 89
1 (2) ensure that data protection and privacy are considered as the
2 controller makes new decisions with respect to the processing.
3 (g) A controller shall retain for at least three years all data protection
4 assessments the controller conducts under this section.
5 § 2422. DE-IDENTIFIED DATA
6 (a) A controller in possession of de-identified data shall:
7 (1) take reasonable measures to ensure that the data cannot be used to
8 reidentify an identified or identifiable individual or be associated with an
9 individual or device that identifies or is linked or reasonably linkable to an
10 individual or household;
11 (2) publicly commit to maintaining and using de-identified data without
12 attempting to reidentify the data; and

19 to:
20 (1) reidentify de-identified data;

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.71

3 data in order to authenticate the consumer’s request under subsection 2418(b)
4 of this title; or
5 (3) comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if the
6 controller:
7 (A) is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the
8 personal data or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to
9 associate the request with the personal data; and
10 (B) does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the
11 specific consumer who is the subject of the personal data or associate the
12 personal data with other personal data about the same specific consumer.
13 (d) A controller that discloses or transfers de-identified data shall exercise
14 reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any contractual commitments
15 to which the de-identified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to
16 address any breaches of those contractual commitments.

of the consent, cease to process the data as soon as practicable, but not later
than 15 days after the receipt of the request;
(7) shall not process the personal data of a consumer for purposes of
targeted advertising, or sell the consumer’s personal data without the

age but younger than 16 years of age; and
(8) shall not discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the
consumer rights contained in this chapter, including denying goods or services,

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.71
2025 Page 78 of 89
consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain, or prohibit a
controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of
goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee
if the offering is in connection with a consumer’s voluntary participation in a
bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card program.
(c) A controller shall provide consumers with a reasonably accessible,
clear, and meaningful privacy notice that includes:

one or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit a request to
exercise their consumer rights pursuant to this chapter.

to opt out of the targeted advertising or sale of the consumer’s personal data;
and
(ii) not later than January 1, 2026, allowing a consumer to opt
out of any processing of the consumer’s personal data for the purposes of
targeted advertising, or any sale of the personal data, through an opt-out
preference signal sent to the controller with the consumer’s consent indicating
the consumer’s intent to opt out of any the processing or sale, by a platform,
technology, or other mechanism that shall:
(I) not unfairly disadvantage another controller;
(II) not make use of a default setting, but rather require the
consumer to make an affirmative, freely given, and unambiguous choice to opt
out of any processing of the consumer’s personal data pursuant to this
chapter;
(III) be consumer-friendly and easy to use by the average
consumer;
(IV) be as consistent as possible with any other similar
platform, technology, or mechanism required by any federal or State law or

consumer’s personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, or any sale
of the personal data, through an opt-out preference signal sent in accordance
with the provisions of subdivision (A) of this subdivision (e)(4) conflicts with
the consumer’s existing controller-specific privacy setting or voluntary
participation in a controller’s bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features,
discounts, or club card program, the controller shall comply with the
consumer’s opt-out preference signal but may notify the consumer of the
conflict and provide to the consumer the choice to confirm the controller-
specific privacy setting or participation in the program.
(5) If a controller responds to consumer opt-out requests received
pursuant to subdivision (4)(A) of this subsection by informing the consumer of
a charge for the use of any product or service, the controller shall present the

§ 2421. PROCESSORS’ DUTIES; CONTRACTS BETWEEN
CONTROLLERS AND PROCESSORS
(a) A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall
assist the controller in meeting the controller’s obligations under this chapter,
including:
(1) taking into account the nature of processing and the information
available to the processor, by appropriate technical and organizational
measures, to the extent reasonably practicable, to fulfill the controller’s
obligation to respond to consumer rights requests;
(2) taking into account the nature of processing and the information
available to the processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the
controller’s obligations in relation to the security of processing the personal
data and in relation to the notification of a data broker security breach or
security breach, as defined in section 2430 of this title, of the system of the
processor, in order to meet the controller’s obligations; and
(3) providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct
and document data protection assessments.
(b)(1) A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the
processor’s data processing procedures with respect to processing performed
on behalf of the controller.
(2) The contract shall be binding and clearly set forth instructions for
processing data, the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject
to processing, the duration of processing, and the rights and obligations of
both parties.
(3) The contract shall require that the processor:
(A) ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a
duty of confidentiality with respect to the data;
(B) at the controller’s direction, delete or return all personal data to
the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless

controller’s or processor’s role in the processing relationship, as described in
this chapter.
(d)(1) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor
with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that
depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed.
(2) A person who is not limited in the person’s processing of personal
data pursuant to a controller’s instructions, or who fails to adhere to the
instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to a specific
processing of data.
(3) A processor that continues to adhere to a controller’s instructions
with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor.
(4) If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the
purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor is a
controller with respect to the processing and may be subject to an enforcement
action under section 2425 of this title.
§ 2422. CONTROLLERS’ DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENTS;
DISCLOSURE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL
(a) A controller shall conduct and document a data protection assessment
for each of the controller’s processing activities that presents a heightened risk
of harm to a consumer, which for the purposes of this section includes:
(1) the processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.71
2025 Page 82 of 89

(b)(1) Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (a) of
this section shall identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and
indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other
stakeholders, and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the
consumer associated with the processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can
be employed by the controller to reduce the risks.
(2) The controller shall factor into any data protection assessment the
use of de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well
as the context of the processing and the relationship between the controller and
the consumer whose personal data will be processed.

protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the
Attorney General, and the controller shall make the data protection assessment
available to the Attorney General.

(3) Data protection assessments shall be confidential and shall be
exempt from disclosure and copying under the Public Records Act.

constitute a waiver of the privilege or protection.
(d) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of
processing operations that include similar activities.
(e) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of
complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection
assessment shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements established in this
section if the data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and
effect to the data protection assessment that would otherwise be conducted
pursuant to this section.
(f) Data protection assessment requirements shall apply to processing
activities created or generated after July 1, 2025 and are not retroactive.

authenticated consumer request with personal data.
(c) This chapter shall not be construed to require a controller or processor
to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if the controller:
(1) is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the
personal data or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to
associate the request with the personal data;
(2) does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the specific
consumer who is the subject of the personal data, or associate the personal
data with other personal data about the same specific consumer; and
(3) does not sell the personal data to any third party or otherwise
voluntarily disclose the personal data to any third party other than a processor,
except as otherwise permitted in this section.
(d) The rights afforded under subdivisions 2418(a)(1)–(4) of this title shall
not apply to pseudonymous data in cases where the controller is able to
demonstrate that any information necessary to identify the consumer is kept
separately and is subject to effective technical and organizational controls that
prevent the controller from accessing the information.
(e) A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or de-identified data
shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any
contractual commitments to which the pseudonymous data or de-identified
data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to address any breaches of
those contractual commitments.

concerning a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under
the laws of the State as part of a privileged communication.

knowledge that the receiving processor or third-party controller would violate
this chapter.
(2) A third-party controller or processor receiving personal data from a
