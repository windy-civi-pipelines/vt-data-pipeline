1 advertising, or any sale of the personal data, through an opt-out preference
2 signal sent to the controller with the consumer’s consent indicating the
3 consumer’s intent to opt out of any the processing or sale, by a platform,
4 technology, or other mechanism that shall:
5 (I) not unfairly disadvantage another controller;
6 (II) not make use of a default setting, but rather require the
7 consumer to make an affirmative, freely given, and unambiguous choice to opt
8 out of any processing of the consumer’s personal data pursuant to this chapter;

VT LEG #382247 v.1
AS PASSED BY SENATE S.71
2025 Page 27 of 44
1 the consumer’s existing controller-specific privacy setting or voluntary
2 participation in a controller’s bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features,

19 measures, to the extent reasonably practicable, to fulfill the controller’s
20 obligation to respond to consumer rights requests;
VT LEG #382247 v.1
AS PASSED BY SENATE S.71
2025 Page 28 of 44
1 (2) taking into account the nature of processing and the information
2 available to the processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the
3 controller’s obligations in relation to the security of processing the personal
4 data and in relation to the notification of a data broker security breach or
5 security breach, as defined in section 2430 of this title, of the system of the
6 processor, in order to meet the controller’s obligations; and
7 (3) providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct
8 and document data protection assessments.
9 (b)(1) A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the
10 processor’s data processing procedures with respect to processing performed
11 on behalf of the controller.
12 (2) The contract shall be binding and clearly set forth instructions for
13 processing data, the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject
14 to processing, the duration of processing, and the rights and obligations of both
15 parties.
16 (3) The contract shall require that the processor:
17 (A) ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a
18 duty of confidentiality with respect to the data;
19 (B) at the controller’s direction, delete or return all personal data to
20 the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless

7 controller with respect to the processing and may be subject to an enforcement
8 action under section 2425 of this title.

3 offensive to a reasonable person; or
4 (D) other substantial injury to consumers; and

6 (b)(1) Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (a) of
7 this section shall identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and
8 indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other
9 stakeholders, and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the
10 consumer associated with the processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can
11 be employed by the controller to reduce the risks.
12 (2) The controller shall factor into any data protection assessment the
13 use of de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well
14 as the context of the processing and the relationship between the controller and
15 the consumer whose personal data will be processed.

6 constitute a waiver of the privilege or protection.
7 (d) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of
8 processing operations that include similar activities.
9 (e) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of
10 complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection
11 assessment shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements established in this
12 section if the data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and
13 effect to the data protection assessment that would otherwise be conducted
14 pursuant to this section.
15 (f) Data protection assessment requirements shall apply to processing
16 activities created or generated after July 1, 2025 and are not retroactive.

12 consumer request with personal data.
13 (c) This chapter shall not be construed to require a controller or processor
14 to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if the controller:
15 (1) is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal
16 data or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the
17 request with the personal data;
18 (2) does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the specific
19 consumer who is the subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data
20 with other personal data about the same specific consumer; and

6 (b)(1) Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (a) of
7 this section shall identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and

11 be employed by the controller to reduce the risks.
12 (2) The controller shall factor into any data protection assessment the
13 use of de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well

4 determines, or similar independent oversight entities that determine:
5 (A) whether the deletion of the information is likely to provide
6 substantial benefits that do not exclusively accrue to the controller;

13 controller, or third party with any of the obligations under this chapter; or
14 (12) process personal data for reasons of public interest in the area of
15 public health, community health, or population health, but solely to the extent

18 (B) The data shall be subject to reasonable administrative, technical,
19 and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility
20 of the personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of harm to

7 section shall not solely make a legal entity a controller or consumer health data
8 controller with respect to the processing.
