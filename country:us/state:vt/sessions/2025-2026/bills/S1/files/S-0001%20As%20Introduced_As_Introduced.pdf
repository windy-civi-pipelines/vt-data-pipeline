4 Date:
5 Subject: Health; Medicaid; eligibility
6 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to provide
7 Medicaid-equivalent coverage to all Vermonters by age bands over time,
8 regardless of household income. It would direct the Agency of Human
9 Services to seek approval for federal financial participation in the expanded
10 coverage, with the State paying the full amount if the federal government does
11 not approve the request. The bill would direct the Agency of Human Services
12 and others to develop cost estimates for the Medicaid-equivalent coverage and
13 a detailed implementation plan. The bill would also require the Department of
14 Taxes to report on potential payroll tax design options to support the State’s
15 financial obligation in providing the Medicaid-equivalent coverage, both with
16 and without the federal funding.
17 An act relating to providing Medicaid-equivalent coverage to all
18 Vermonters
