Hospital on its 120th anniversary.
(S.C.R.1)
Offered by Senators Harrison and Hashim,
Offered by Representatives Burke of Brattleboro, Goodnow of Brattleboro, and
Kornheiser of Brattleboro
Whereas, the unusual origin of the Brattleboro Memorial Hospital can be traced to the
1843 marriage of Thomas Thompson, a wealthy Bostonian, to Elizabeth Rowel, a domestic
servant; their considerable financial legacy; the dearth of sewing women in 1900
Brattleboro as their primary intended beneficiaries; and the associated trust’s provision that
surplus funds be “applied to kindred charitable purposes in town (Brattleboro)” that
resulted in a Massachusetts probate court’s holding that $100,000.00 of these funds could
be used for the establishment of a local hospital, and
Whereas, in 1904, the trustee purchased the George Hall estate, known as the Hemlocks,
and in that same year, the General Assembly adopted 1904 Acts and Resolves No. 277, An
Act to incorporate the Hemlocks Hospital of Brattleboro, which then opened in the estate’s
buildings as the Brattleboro Memorial Hospital, featuring both a 37-bed hospital and a
training program for nurses, and
Whereas, in response to the growing needs of the community, major campus
improvements were a medical office building (1970), the Gannett Building for patient care
(1993), the Richards Building for outpatient services (2008), and the Ronald Read Pavilion
for surgical services (2022), and these components now comprise a superb community
health care facility, licensed for 61 beds, employing over 600 staff, that the Lown Institute
has recognized as the top Vermont hospital for “Social Responsibility, Health Equity, and
Community Benefit,” and
Whereas, on October 25, 2024, the friends, staff, and leadership of Brattleboro
Memorial Hospital joyously celebrated this special health care milestone, now
therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates Brattleboro Memorial Hospital on its 120th
anniversary, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Brattleboro Memorial Hospital.
