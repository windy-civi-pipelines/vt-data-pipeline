This act makes several changes to the Stateâ€™s laws affecting business organizations.
While the act mostly makes technical changes, new sections were added to give the
Office of the Secretary of State the authority to reject a business filing it believes is
fraudulent. The act also clarifies the requirements for a business to designate an agent for
service of process. Other changes made in the act are to harmonize terms across Titles
11, 11A, 11B, and 11C in the Vermont Statutes Annotated.
Finally, the Secretary of State is required to conduct a study to address issues related
to the business filing system and to review the need for additional statutory revisions,
including any adjustments to the amount of fees assessed for various business filings. A
final report is due on or before December 1, 2026.
