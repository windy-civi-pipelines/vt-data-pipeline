Offered by Senators Bongartz and Plunkett
House concurrent resolution congratulating the Bennington Free Library on its 160th anniversary
Whereas, a community-oriented public library can serve as a major contributor to the civic, cultural, and
educational vibrancy of a Vermont municipality, and
Whereas, the Bennington Free Library (BFL), with a mission to “provide a dynamic, welcoming
environment that enriches lives…[and] promotes lifelong learning and literacy,” epitomizes this goal, and
Whereas, the long and proud history of the BFLdates from June 23, 1865, when Trenor W. Park and Seth B.
Hunt deeded a Main Street property and their collection of 1,800 books to the library’s original five trustees for
the new library, which was located on the building’s second floor and which was originally under the
organizational auspices of the Young Men’s Association and the capable leadership of the first librarian,
Charles W. Smith, and
Whereas, membership was opened to all for the price of one dollar, but women’s borrowing privileges were
restricted to one volume at a time, and
Whereas, in 1892, when the library’s growth demanded a more commodious space, it relocated to the
building’s downstairs floor; then in 1936, as the collection expanded and patronage increased, the BFL
constructed a new purposely built Georgian style structure on the same lot, with a skylight of the solar system,
reportedly composed of Tiffany glass; and a half-century later, the two buildings were connected, and
Whereas, in 2005, the library’s operational systems transitioned to the digital era, and in 2014, a major
software upgrade coincided with the BFLjoining a consortium of 25 libraries, and
Whereas, late fines were abolished in 2020, and finally in 2024, the membership fee was eliminated, both of
which ended borrowing disincentives, and
Whereas, in 2025, the BFL’s 55,000-item collection encompasses books, periodicals, DVDs, snowshoes, a
telescope, and museum passes; services offered include book delivery for homebound patrons, public-use
computers, interlibrary loans, a variety of public programs, and a great staff that the BFL’s 23rd librarian,
Wendy M. Sharkey, expertly directs, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the Bennington Free Library on its 160th anniversary, and be it
further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the BFL.
