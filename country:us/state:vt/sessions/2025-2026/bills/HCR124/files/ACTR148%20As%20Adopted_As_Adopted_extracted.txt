Whereas, a community-oriented public library can serve as a major contributor to the
civic, cultural, and educational vibrancy of a Vermont municipality, and
Whereas, the Bennington Free Library (BFL), with a mission to “provide a dynamic,
welcoming environment that enriches lives…[and] promotes lifelong learning and
literacy,” epitomizes this goal, and
Whereas, the long and proud history of the BFL dates from June 23, 1865, when
Trenor W. Park and Seth B. Hunt deeded a Main Street property and their collection of
1,800 books to the library’s original five trustees for the new library, which was located
on the building’s second floor and which was originally under the organizational auspices
of the Young Men’s Association and the capable leadership of the first librarian, Charles
W. Smith, and
Whereas, membership was opened to all for the price of one dollar, but women’s
borrowing privileges were restricted to one volume at a time, and
Whereas, in 1892, when the library’s growth demanded a more commodious space, it
relocated to the building’s downstairs floor; then in 1936, as the collection expanded and
patronage increased, the BFL constructed a new purposely built Georgian style structure
on the same lot, with a skylight of the solar system, reportedly composed of Tiffany
glass; and a half-century later, the two buildings were connected, and
Whereas, in 2005, the library’s operational systems transitioned to the digital era, and
in 2014, a major software upgrade coincided with the BFL joining a consortium of 25
libraries, and
Whereas, late fines were abolished in 2020, and finally in 2024, the membership fee
was eliminated, both of which ended borrowing disincentives, and
Whereas, in 2025, the BFL’s 55,000-item collection encompasses books, periodicals,
DVDs, snowshoes, a telescope, and museum passes; services offered include book
delivery for homebound patrons, public-use computers, interlibrary loans, a variety of
public programs, and a great staff that the BFL’s 23rd librarian, Wendy M. Sharkey,
expertly directs, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the Bennington Free Library on its 160th
anniversary, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the BFL.
