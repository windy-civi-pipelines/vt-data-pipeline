12 Commissioner of Education who shall be employed by the State Board as the
13 chief executive officer and secretary of the Board, subject to approval of the
14 Governor. This bill also proposes to change the composition of the State
15 Board of Education and to create a new appointment process for Board

2 * * * Findings and Intent * * *
3 Sec. 1. FINDINGS AND INTENT
4 (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds that:
5 (1) Recent challenges faced by the Agency of Education, including
6 compliance issues with federal reporting requirements, highlight a need for
7 stronger leadership and structural reform. The Agency of Education is now
8 seen as a political tool of the Governor. With a two-year Governor term,
9 Vermont needs a Department of Education and Commissioner of Education
10 that report directly to a neutral State Board of Education with a focus on
11 leading Vermont to the best educational system in the United States.
12 (2) Concerns about transparency and effectiveness have eroded public
13 confidence in the Agency of Education. Transitioning back to a department
14 aligns with historical norms and best practices for state education governance.
15 (3) A department structure allows for greater focus on addressing
16 critical issues such as academic achievement gaps, mental health support, and
17 equitable resource distribution.
18 (b) Intent. It is the intent of the General Assembly to increase
19 accountability, improve operational efficiency, and strengthen public
20 confidence in Vermont’s education governance by transitioning the Agency of
VT LEG #380288 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.179

13 school, school district, and supervisory union to determine its strengths and
14 weaknesses. To the extent consistent with State and federal privacy laws and
15 regulations, data on hazing, harassment, or bullying incidents shall be
16 disaggregated by incident type, including disaggregation by ethnic groups,
17 racial groups, religious groups, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity,
