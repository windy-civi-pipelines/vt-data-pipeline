Whereas, approximately 28 percent of Vermont’s population is 60 years of age or older, and according to the
Vermont Foodbank, the threat of hunger confronts 12 percent of older Vermonters, and
Whereas, on March 22, 1972, President Richard Nixon signed Public Law 92-258, an amendment to the
Older Americans Act of 1965, that established the national Senior Nutrition Program for older Americans, and
Whereas, the impetus for the national Senior Nutrition Program was the recognition that persons in this age
group may not eat adequately due to a lack of finances, an inability to prepare nourishing meals, limited
mobility, and feelings of loneliness, and
Whereas, in Vermont, the national Senior Nutrition Program is administered through the State Unit on Aging
at the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent Living and the area agencies on aging, and
Whereas, Meals on Wheels is a key element of the national Senior Nutrition Program through its provision
of nutritious meals, safety checks, and friendly visits to those at risk of hunger and isolation, and
Whereas, in 2024, 42 Meals on Wheels providers delivered 986,662 nutritious home-delivered meals to
thousands of older Vermonters, greatly improving their daily physical and emotional lives, and
Whereas, Meals on Wheels is an important component of Age Strong VT, a 10-year program designed to
make Vermont “a great place for all ages and stages of life,” and
Whereas, each March, the federal Administration for Community Living celebrates the establishment of the
national Senior Nutrition Program, and the theme for 2025 is “A Place at the Table,” “[recognizing] the
importance of local nutrition programs and the meals being served across the country,” now therefore be it
