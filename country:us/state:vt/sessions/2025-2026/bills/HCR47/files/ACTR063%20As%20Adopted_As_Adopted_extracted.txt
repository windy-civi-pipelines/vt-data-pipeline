2025
Nutrition Program Month in Vermont.
(H.C.R.47)
Offered by Representative Noyes of Wolcott
Whereas, approximately 28 percent of Vermont’s population is 60 years of age or
older, and according to the Vermont Foodbank, the threat of hunger confronts 12 percent
of older Vermonters, and
Whereas, on March 22, 1972, President Richard Nixon signed Public Law 92-258, an
amendment to the Older Americans Act of 1965, that established the national Senior
Nutrition Program for older Americans, and
Whereas, the impetus for the national Senior Nutrition Program was the recognition
that persons in this age group may not eat adequately due to a lack of finances, an
inability to prepare nourishing meals, limited mobility, and feelings of loneliness, and
Whereas, in Vermont, the national Senior Nutrition Program is administered through
the State Unit on Aging at the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent Living
and the area agencies on aging, and
Whereas, Meals on Wheels is a key element of the national Senior Nutrition Program
through its provision of nutritious meals, safety checks, and friendly visits to those at
risk of hunger and isolation, and
Whereas, in 2024, 42 Meals on Wheels providers delivered 986,662 nutritious
home-delivered meals to thousands of older Vermonters, greatly improving their
daily physical and emotional lives, and
Whereas, Meals on Wheels is an important component of Age Strong VT, a 10-year
program designed to make Vermont “a great place for all ages and stages of life,” and
Whereas, each March, the federal Administration for Community Living celebrates the
establishment of the national Senior Nutrition Program, and the theme for 2025 is “A
Place at the Table,” “[recognizing] the importance of local nutrition programs and the
meals being served across the country,” now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly recognizes March 2025 as National Senior Nutrition
Program Month in Vermont, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent Living and the Vermont
Association of Senior Centers and Meal Providers.
