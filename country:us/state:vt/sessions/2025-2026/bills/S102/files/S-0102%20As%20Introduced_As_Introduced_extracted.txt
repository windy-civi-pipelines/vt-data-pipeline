15 (a) Program. The Vermont Economic Progress Council is authorized to
16 approve SPARC projects and to finance municipal investments within a
17 SPARC site or to provide financing to a community investment partner
18 consistent with the terms of the community agreement.
19 (b) General authority. Under the program established in subsection (a) of
20 this section, a municipality, upon approval of the community agreement by its
VT LEG #380409 v.2
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.102
2025 Page 64 of 94
1 legislative body, may apply to the Vermont Economic Progress Council to use
2 financing for a SPARC project.
3 (c) Approval process. The Vermont Economic Progress Council shall do
4 all of the following to approve an application:
5 (1) Application review.
6 (A) Review each application to determine that the improvements
7 proposed to serve the SPARC site and the proposed development in the
8 SPARC site would not have occurred as proposed in the application or would
9 have occurred in a significantly different and less desirable manner than as
10 proposed in the application, but for the proposed utilization of the incremental
11 tax revenues.
12 (B) The review shall take into account:
13 (i) the amount of additional time, if any, needed to complete the
14 proposed development within the SPARC site and the amount of additional
15 cost that might be incurred if the SPARC project were to proceed without
16 financing;
17 (ii) the lack of new construction in the municipality, indicated by a
18 stagnant or declining grand list value as determined by the Department of
19 Taxes, considering both the total full listed value and the equalized education
20 grand list value, or the documented need for housing in the municipality as
21 stated in the most recent housing needs assessment; and
VT LEG #380409 v.2
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.102
2025 Page 65 of 94
1 (iii)(I) the amount of additional revenue expected to be generated
2 as a result of the proposed SPARC project;
3 (II) the sufficiency of that incremental revenue to cover the
4 incurred debt;
5 (III) the percentage of that revenue that shall be paid to the
6 Education Fund;
7 (IV) the percentage that shall be paid to the municipality; and
8 (V) the percentage of the revenue paid to the municipality that
9 shall be used to pay financing incurred for development of the SPARC project
10 and related costs.
11 (2) Process requirements. Determine that each application meets all of
12 the following requirements:
13 (A) The municipality held public hearings and established a SPARC
14 site.
15 (B) The municipality has developed a SPARC financing plan,
16 including a project description; a development financing plan; a pro forma
17 projection of expected costs; a projection of revenues; evidence that the
18 municipality is actively seeking or has obtained other sources of funding and
19 investment; and a development schedule that includes a list, a cost estimate,
20 and a schedule for public improvements and projected private development to
21 occur as a result of the improvements. The life of the project begins at 12:01

5 incremental municipal tax revenues for the purposes of the SPARC project in
6 the proportion set forth in subdivision (g)(2) of this section.
7 (3) The Vermont Economic Progress Council shall determine there is a
8 relationship between the improvement and the expected development and
9 redevelopment for the SPARC project and expected outcomes.
10 (d) Incurring indebtedness.
11 (1) A municipality approved under the process set forth in subsection (c)
12 of this section may incur indebtedness against revenues of the SPARC site to
13 provide funding to pay for improvements and related costs for the SPARC
14 project development.
15 (2) Notwithstanding any provision of any municipal charter, the
16 municipality shall only require one authorizing vote to incur debt through one
17 instance of borrowing to finance or otherwise pay for the tax increment
18 financing project improvements and related costs; provided, however, that a
19 municipality may present one or more subsequent authorization votes in the
20 event a vote fails. The municipality shall be authorized to incur indebtedness
21 only after the legal voters of the municipality, by a majority vote of all voters
VT LEG #380409 v.2
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.102
2025 Page 67 of 94
1 present and voting on the question at a special or annual municipal meeting
2 duly warned for the purpose, authorize the legislative body to pledge the credit
3 of the municipality, borrow, or otherwise secure the debt for the specific
4 purposes so warned.
5 (3) Any indebtedness shall be incurred within five years following the
6 date of approval by the Vermont Economic Progress Council. A bond
7 anticipation note is not considered a first or last incurrence of debt. The
8 Vermont Economic Progress Council may extend the period of time to incur
9 debt for a period not to exceed three years.
10 (4) A municipal legislative body shall provide information to the
11 public prior to the public vote required under subdivision (2) of this subsection.
12 This information shall include the amount and types of debt and related costs
13 to be incurred, including principal, interest, and fees; terms of the debt; the
14 improvements to be financed; the expected development to occur because of
15 the improvements; and notice to the voters that if the tax increment received by
16 the municipality from any property tax source is insufficient to pay the
17 principal and interest on the debt in any year, for whatever reason, including a
18 decrease in property value or repeal of a State property tax source, unless
19 determined otherwise at the time of such repeal, the municipality shall remain
20 liable for the full payment of the principal and interest for the term of
21 indebtedness. If interfund loans within the municipality are used, the
VT LEG #380409 v.2
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.102
2025 Page 68 of 94
1 information must also include documentation of the terms and conditions of
2 such loan. If interfund loans within the municipality are used as a method of
3 financing, no interest shall be charged.
4 (e) Original taxable value. As of the date the project is approved by the
5 Vermont Economic Progress Council, the lister or assessor for the municipality
6 shall certify the original taxable value and shall certify to the Vermont
7 Economic Progress Council in each year thereafter during the life of the
8 SPARC site the amount by which the total valuation as determined in
9 accordance with 32 V.S.A. chapter 129 of all taxable real property located
10 within the SPARC site has increased or decreased relative to the original
11 taxable value.
12 (f) Incremental community enhancements.
13 (1) In each year following the approval of the SPARC site, the lister or
14 assessor shall include not more than the original taxable value of the real
15 property in the assessed valuation upon which the treasurer computes the rates
16 of all taxes levied by the municipality and every other taxing district in which
17 the SPARC site is situated, but the treasurer shall extend all rates so
18 determined against the entire assessed valuation of real property for that year.
19 In each year, the municipality shall hold apart, rather than remit to the taxing
20 districts, that proportion of all taxes paid that year on the real property within
21 the SPARC site that the excess valuation bears to the total assessed valuation.
VT LEG #380409 v.2
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.102
2025 Page 69 of 94
1 The amount held apart each year is the “incremental community enhancement”
2 for that year. Not more than the percentages established pursuant to subsection
3 (g) of this section of the municipal and State education tax increments received
4 with respect to the SPARC site and committed for the payment for financing
5 for improvements and related costs shall be segregated by the municipality in a
6 special SPARC financing project account and in its official books and records
7 until all capital indebtedness of the project has been fully paid. The final
8 payment shall be reported to the treasurer, who shall thereafter include the
9 entire assessed valuation of the SPARC site in the assessed valuations upon
10 which municipal and other tax rates are computed and extended and thereafter
11 no taxes from the SPARC site shall be deposited in the SPARC site’s SPARC
12 financing project account.
13 (2) In each year, a municipality shall remit not less than the aggregate
14 tax due on the original taxable value to the Education Fund.
15 (3) Notwithstanding any charter provision or other provision, all
16 property taxes assessed within a SPARC site shall be subject to the provision
17 of subdivision (1) of this subsection. Special assessments levied under chapter
18 76A or 87 of this title or under a municipal charter shall not be considered
19 property taxes for the purpose of this section if the proceeds are used
20 exclusively for operating expenses related to properties within the SPARC site.
VT LEG #380409 v.2
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.102
2025 Page 70 of 94
1 (4) Amounts held apart under subdivision (1) of this subsection shall
2 only be used for financing and related costs as defined in section 1907 of this
3 subchapter.
4 (g) Use of incremental community enhancement.
5 (1) Use of the education property tax increment. For only debt incurred
6 within the period permitted under subdivision (d)(3) of this section after
7 approval of the project, up to 100 percent of the education tax increment may
8 be retained to service the debt and related costs, beginning with the first year in
9 which debt is incurred for the SPARC project. Upon incurring the first debt, a
10 municipality shall notify the Department of Taxes and the Vermont Economic
11 Progress Council of the beginning of the retention period of the education tax
12 increment.
13 (2) Use of the municipal property tax increment. For only debt incurred
14 within the period permitted under subdivision (d)(3) of this section after
15 approval of the project, not less than 100 percent of the municipal tax
16 increment shall be retained to service the debt and related costs, beginning the
17 first year in which debt is incurred for the project.
18 (3) Retention period. Retention of tax increment shall continue until all
19 debt is retired.
20 (h) Distribution. Of the municipal and education tax increments received
21 in any tax year that exceed the amounts committed for the payment of the
VT LEG #380409 v.2
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.102
2025 Page 71 of 94
1 financing for improvements and related costs for the SPARC project, equal
2 portions of each increment may be retained for the following purposes:
3 prepayment of principal and interest on the financing, placed in a special
4 account required by subdivision (f)(1) of this section and used for future
5 financing payments, or used for defeasance of the financing. Any remaining
6 portion of the excess municipal tax increment shall be distributed to the city,
7 town, or village budget, in the proportion that each budget bears to the
8 combined total of the budgets, unless otherwise negotiated by the city, town, or
9 village, and any remaining portion of the excess education tax increment shall
10 be distributed to the Education Fund.
11 (i) Information reporting. A municipality with a SPARC project approved
12 pursuant to this section shall:
13 (1) Develop a system, segregated for the SPARC project, to identify,
14 collect, and maintain all data and information necessary to fulfill the reporting
15 requirements of this section, including performance measures as outlined in the
16 community agreement.
17 (2) Provide, as required by events, notification to the Vermont
18 Economic Progress Council and the Department of Taxes regarding any
19 SPARC project debt obligations, public votes, or votes by the municipal
20 legislative body immediately following such obligation or vote on a form
21 prescribed by the Council, including copies of public notices, agendas,
VT LEG #380409 v.2
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.102
2025 Page 72 of 94
1 minutes, vote tally, and a copy of the information provided to the public in
2 accordance with subdivision (d)(4) of this section.
3 (3) Ensure that the SPARC financing project account required by
4 subdivision (f)(1) of this section is subject to the annual audit prescribed in
5 subsection (j) of this section. Procedures shall include verification of the
6 original taxable value and annual and total municipal and education tax
7 increments generated, expenditures for debt and related costs, and current
8 balance.
9 (j) Audit; financial reports. Annually on or before April 1, until the year
10 following the end of the period for retention of education tax increment, a
11 municipality with a SPARC project approved under this section shall ensure
12 that the SPARC project is subject to the annual audit prescribed in sections
13 1681 and, if applicable, 1690 of this title and submit a copy of the audit report
14 to the Vermont Economic Progress Council. In the event that the SPARC
15 project is only subject to the audit under section 1681 of this title, the Vermont
16 Economic Progress Council shall ensure a process is in place to subject the
17 SPARC project to an independent audit. Procedures for the audit must include
18 verification of the original taxable value and annual and total municipal and
19 education tax increments generated, expenditures for debt and related costs,
20 and current balance.

16 approve SPARC projects and to finance municipal investments within a
17 SPARC site or to provide financing to a community investment partner
18 consistent with the terms of the community agreement.

20 this section, a municipality, upon approval of the community agreement by its
VT LEG #380409 v.2

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.102
2025 Page 64 of 94
1 legislative body, may apply to the Vermont Economic Progress Council to use
2 financing for a SPARC project.
3 (c) Approval process. The Vermont Economic Progress Council shall do
4 all of the following to approve an application:
5 (1) Application review.
6 (A) Review each application to determine that the improvements
7 proposed to serve the SPARC site and the proposed development in the
8 SPARC site would not have occurred as proposed in the application or would
9 have occurred in a significantly different and less desirable manner than as
10 proposed in the application, but for the proposed utilization of the incremental
11 tax revenues.
12 (B) The review shall take into account:
13 (i) the amount of additional time, if any, needed to complete the
14 proposed development within the SPARC site and the amount of additional
15 cost that might be incurred if the SPARC project were to proceed without
16 financing;
17 (ii) the lack of new construction in the municipality, indicated by a
18 stagnant or declining grand list value as determined by the Department of
19 Taxes, considering both the total full listed value and the equalized education
20 grand list value, or the documented need for housing in the municipality as
21 stated in the most recent housing needs assessment; and
VT LEG #380409 v.2

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.102
2025 Page 65 of 94
1 (iii)(I) the amount of additional revenue expected to be generated

5 (III) the percentage of that revenue that shall be paid to the
6 Education Fund;
7 (IV) the percentage that shall be paid to the municipality; and
8 (V) the percentage of the revenue paid to the municipality that
9 shall be used to pay financing incurred for development of the SPARC project
10 and related costs.
11 (2) Process requirements. Determine that each application meets all of
12 the following requirements:
13 (A) The municipality held public hearings and established a SPARC
14 site.
15 (B) The municipality has developed a SPARC financing plan,
16 including a project description; a development financing plan; a pro forma
17 projection of expected costs; a projection of revenues; evidence that the
18 municipality is actively seeking or has obtained other sources of funding and
19 investment; and a development schedule that includes a list, a cost estimate,
20 and a schedule for public improvements and projected private development to
21 occur as a result of the improvements. The life of the project begins at 12:01

7 (3) The Vermont Economic Progress Council shall determine there is a
8 relationship between the improvement and the expected development and
9 redevelopment for the SPARC project and expected outcomes.
10 (d) Incurring indebtedness.
11 (1) A municipality approved under the process set forth in subsection (c)
12 of this section may incur indebtedness against revenues of the SPARC site to
13 provide funding to pay for improvements and related costs for the SPARC
14 project development.
15 (2) Notwithstanding any provision of any municipal charter, the
16 municipality shall only require one authorizing vote to incur debt through one
17 instance of borrowing to finance or otherwise pay for the tax increment
18 financing project improvements and related costs; provided, however, that a
19 municipality may present one or more subsequent authorization votes in the
20 event a vote fails. The municipality shall be authorized to incur indebtedness
21 only after the legal voters of the municipality, by a majority vote of all voters

1 present and voting on the question at a special or annual municipal meeting
2 duly warned for the purpose, authorize the legislative body to pledge the credit
3 of the municipality, borrow, or otherwise secure the debt for the specific
4 purposes so warned.
5 (3) Any indebtedness shall be incurred within five years following the
6 date of approval by the Vermont Economic Progress Council. A bond
7 anticipation note is not considered a first or last incurrence of debt. The
8 Vermont Economic Progress Council may extend the period of time to incur
9 debt for a period not to exceed three years.
10 (4) A municipal legislative body shall provide information to the
11 public prior to the public vote required under subdivision (2) of this subsection.
12 This information shall include the amount and types of debt and related costs
13 to be incurred, including principal, interest, and fees; terms of the debt; the
14 improvements to be financed; the expected development to occur because of
15 the improvements; and notice to the voters that if the tax increment received by
16 the municipality from any property tax source is insufficient to pay the
17 principal and interest on the debt in any year, for whatever reason, including a
18 decrease in property value or repeal of a State property tax source, unless
19 determined otherwise at the time of such repeal, the municipality shall remain
20 liable for the full payment of the principal and interest for the term of
21 indebtedness. If interfund loans within the municipality are used, the
VT LEG #380409 v.2

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.102
2025 Page 68 of 94
1 information must also include documentation of the terms and conditions of
2 such loan. If interfund loans within the municipality are used as a method of
3 financing, no interest shall be charged.
4 (e) Original taxable value. As of the date the project is approved by the
5 Vermont Economic Progress Council, the lister or assessor for the municipality
6 shall certify the original taxable value and shall certify to the Vermont
7 Economic Progress Council in each year thereafter during the life of the
8 SPARC site the amount by which the total valuation as determined in
9 accordance with 32 V.S.A. chapter 129 of all taxable real property located
10 within the SPARC site has increased or decreased relative to the original
11 taxable value.
12 (f) Incremental community enhancements.
13 (1) In each year following the approval of the SPARC site, the lister or
14 assessor shall include not more than the original taxable value of the real
15 property in the assessed valuation upon which the treasurer computes the rates
16 of all taxes levied by the municipality and every other taxing district in which
17 the SPARC site is situated, but the treasurer shall extend all rates so
18 determined against the entire assessed valuation of real property for that year.
19 In each year, the municipality shall hold apart, rather than remit to the taxing
20 districts, that proportion of all taxes paid that year on the real property within
21 the SPARC site that the excess valuation bears to the total assessed valuation.
VT LEG #380409 v.2

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.102
2025 Page 69 of 94
1 The amount held apart each year is the “incremental community enhancement”
2 for that year. Not more than the percentages established pursuant to subsection
3 (g) of this section of the municipal and State education tax increments received
4 with respect to the SPARC site and committed for the payment for financing
5 for improvements and related costs shall be segregated by the municipality in a
6 special SPARC financing project account and in its official books and records
7 until all capital indebtedness of the project has been fully paid. The final
8 payment shall be reported to the treasurer, who shall thereafter include the
9 entire assessed valuation of the SPARC site in the assessed valuations upon
10 which municipal and other tax rates are computed and extended and thereafter
11 no taxes from the SPARC site shall be deposited in the SPARC site’s SPARC
12 financing project account.
13 (2) In each year, a municipality shall remit not less than the aggregate
14 tax due on the original taxable value to the Education Fund.
15 (3) Notwithstanding any charter provision or other provision, all
16 property taxes assessed within a SPARC site shall be subject to the provision
17 of subdivision (1) of this subsection. Special assessments levied under chapter
18 76A or 87 of this title or under a municipal charter shall not be considered
19 property taxes for the purpose of this section if the proceeds are used
20 exclusively for operating expenses related to properties within the SPARC site.
VT LEG #380409 v.2

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.102
2025 Page 70 of 94
1 (4) Amounts held apart under subdivision (1) of this subsection shall
2 only be used for financing and related costs as defined in section 1907 of this
3 subchapter.
4 (g) Use of incremental community enhancement.
5 (1) Use of the education property tax increment. For only debt incurred
6 within the period permitted under subdivision (d)(3) of this section after
7 approval of the project, up to 100 percent of the education tax increment may
8 be retained to service the debt and related costs, beginning with the first year in
9 which debt is incurred for the SPARC project. Upon incurring the first debt, a
10 municipality shall notify the Department of Taxes and the Vermont Economic
11 Progress Council of the beginning of the retention period of the education tax
12 increment.
13 (2) Use of the municipal property tax increment. For only debt incurred
14 within the period permitted under subdivision (d)(3) of this section after
15 approval of the project, not less than 100 percent of the municipal tax
16 increment shall be retained to service the debt and related costs, beginning the
17 first year in which debt is incurred for the project.
18 (3) Retention period. Retention of tax increment shall continue until all
19 debt is retired.
20 (h) Distribution. Of the municipal and education tax increments received
21 in any tax year that exceed the amounts committed for the payment of the
VT LEG #380409 v.2

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.102
2025 Page 71 of 94
1 financing for improvements and related costs for the SPARC project, equal
2 portions of each increment may be retained for the following purposes:
3 prepayment of principal and interest on the financing, placed in a special
4 account required by subdivision (f)(1) of this section and used for future
5 financing payments, or used for defeasance of the financing. Any remaining
6 portion of the excess municipal tax increment shall be distributed to the city,
7 town, or village budget, in the proportion that each budget bears to the
8 combined total of the budgets, unless otherwise negotiated by the city, town, or
9 village, and any remaining portion of the excess education tax increment shall
10 be distributed to the Education Fund.
11 (i) Information reporting. A municipality with a SPARC project approved
12 pursuant to this section shall:
13 (1) Develop a system, segregated for the SPARC project, to identify,
14 collect, and maintain all data and information necessary to fulfill the reporting
15 requirements of this section, including performance measures as outlined in the
16 community agreement.
17 (2) Provide, as required by events, notification to the Vermont
18 Economic Progress Council and the Department of Taxes regarding any
19 SPARC project debt obligations, public votes, or votes by the municipal
20 legislative body immediately following such obligation or vote on a form
21 prescribed by the Council, including copies of public notices, agendas,

1 minutes, vote tally, and a copy of the information provided to the public in
2 accordance with subdivision (d)(4) of this section.
3 (3) Ensure that the SPARC financing project account required by
4 subdivision (f)(1) of this section is subject to the annual audit prescribed in
5 subsection (j) of this section. Procedures shall include verification of the
6 original taxable value and annual and total municipal and education tax
7 increments generated, expenditures for debt and related costs, and current
8 balance.
9 (j) Audit; financial reports. Annually on or before April 1, until the year
10 following the end of the period for retention of education tax increment, a
11 municipality with a SPARC project approved under this section shall ensure
12 that the SPARC project is subject to the annual audit prescribed in sections
13 1681 and, if applicable, 1690 of this title and submit a copy of the audit report
14 to the Vermont Economic Progress Council. In the event that the SPARC
15 project is only subject to the audit under section 1681 of this title, the Vermont
16 Economic Progress Council shall ensure a process is in place to subject the
17 SPARC project to an independent audit. Procedures for the audit must include
18 verification of the original taxable value and annual and total municipal and
19 education tax increments generated, expenditures for debt and related costs,
20 and current balance.

1 (B) The development includes new or rehabilitated affordable
2 housing, as defined in 24 V.S.A. § 4303.
3 (C) The project will affect the remediation and redevelopment of a
4 brownfield located within the district. As used in this section, “brownfield”
5 means an area in which a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant is or
6 may be present, and that situation is likely to complicate the expansion,
7 development, redevelopment, or reuse of the property.
8 (D) The development will include at least one entirely new business
9 or business operation or expansion of an existing business within the district,
10 and this business will provide new, quality, full-time jobs that meet or exceed
11 the prevailing wage for the region as reported by the Department of Labor.
12 (E) The development will enhance transportation by creating
13 improved traffic patterns and flow or creating or improving public
14 transportation systems.
15 (F) The project will mitigate flood risks within a flood-prone area or
16 will relocate development previously destroyed by flooding from a flood-prone
17 area to another area within the municipality where flood risks are significantly
18 lower. As used in this section, “flood-prone area” means an area in which
19 significant residential or commercial property lies within the floodplain.
