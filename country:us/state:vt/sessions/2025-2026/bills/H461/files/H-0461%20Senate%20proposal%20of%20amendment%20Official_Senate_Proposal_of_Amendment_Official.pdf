(2) During any 12-month period, an employee may use up to two weeks
out of the 12 weeks of leave available pursuant to subdivision (1) of this
subsection for bereavement leave, with not more than five workdays to be
taken consecutively.
(b) During the leave, at the employee’s option, the employee may use
accrued sick leave or, vacation leave or, any other accrued paid leave, not to
exceed six weeks or short-term disability insurance. Utilization of accrued
paid leave or short-term disability insurance shall not extend the leave
provided pursuant to this section.
* * *
(e)(1) An employee shall give the employer reasonable written notice of
intent to take leave under this subchapter section. Notice shall include the date
the leave is expected to commence and the estimated duration of the leave. If
the leave is for a family member, the employer may request documentation
identifying the qualifying family relationship.
(2) In the case of the adoption or birth of a child, an employer shall not
require that notice be given more than six weeks prior to the anticipated
commencement of the leave.
(3) In the case of an unanticipated serious health condition, a
miscarriage, an unanticipated need for safe leave, a premature birth, the death
of a family member, or a short-notice qualifying exigency, the employee shall
give the employer notice of the commencement of the leave as soon as
practicable.
(4)(A) In the case of a serious health condition of the employee or a
member of the employee’s family, an employer may require certification from
a health care provider to verify the condition and the amount and necessity for
the leave requested.
(B) An employer may require an employee to provide documentation
of the need for safe leave. An employee may provide documentation from any
one of the following sources:
(i) a court or a law enforcement or other government agency;
(ii) a domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking assistance
program;

(iii) a legal, clerical, medical, or other professional from whom
the employee, or the employee’s family member, received counseling or other
assistance concerning domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking; or
(iv) a self-attestation by the employee describing the
circumstances supporting the need for safe leave; no further corroboration
shall be required unless otherwise mandated by law.
(C) An employer may require an employee to provide documentation
of the need for bereavement leave. An employee may provide any of the
following forms of documentation:
(i) a death certificate;
(ii) a published obituary; or
(iii) a written notice or verification of death, burial, or memorial

§ 825.309.
(E) An employer shall not disclose any private medical information
or information relating to a safe leave that the employer receives pursuant to
this subdivision (4) except to the extent the disclosure is permitted by law and:
(i) consented to by the employee in writing;
(ii) required pursuant to a court order; or
(iii) required pursuant to State or federal law.
(4)(5) An employee may return from leave earlier than estimated upon
approval of the employer.
(5)(6) An employee shall provide reasonable notice to the employer of
the need to extend leave to the extent provided by this subchapter.

be offered the same or comparable job at the same level of compensation,
employment benefits, seniority, or any other term or condition of the
employment existing on the day leave began. This subchapter subsection shall
not apply if, prior to requesting leave, the employee had been given notice or
had given notice that the employment would terminate. This subsection shall
not apply if the employer can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence
that:

(1) during the period of leave the employee’s job would have been
terminated or the employee laid off for reasons unrelated to the leave or the
condition for which the leave was granted; or
(2) the employee performed unique services and hiring a permanent
replacement during the leave, after giving reasonable notice to the employee of
intent to do so, was the only alternative available to the employer to prevent
substantial and grievous economic injury to the employer’s operation.
(g)(1) An employer may adopt a leave policy more generous than the leave
policy provided by this subchapter.
(2)(A) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to diminish an
employer’s obligation to comply with any collective bargaining agreement or
any employment benefit program or plan that provides greater leave rights
than the rights provided by this subchapter.
(B) A collective bargaining agreement or employment benefit
program or plan may not diminish rights provided by this subchapter.
(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subchapter, an employee may,
at the time a need for parental or family leave arises, waive some or all the
rights under this subchapter provided the waiver is informed and voluntary and
any changes in conditions of employment related to any waiver shall be
mutually agreed upon between employer and employee.
(h) Except for the serious health condition of the employee or safe leave
when the employee is the victim or alleged victim, an employee who does not
return to employment with the employer who provided the leave shall return to
the employer the value of any compensation that the employer paid to or on
behalf of the employee during the leave, except payments for accrued sick
leave or vacation leave.
Sec. 4. 21 V.S.A. § 472a is amended to read:
§ 472a. SHORT-TERM FAMILY LEAVE
(a) In addition to the leave provided in section 472 of this title, an
employee shall be entitled to take unpaid leave not to exceed four hours in any
30-day period and not to exceed 24 hours in any 12-month period. An
employer may require that leave be taken in a minimum of two-hour segments
and may be taken for any of the following purposes:
(1) To participate in preschool or school activities directly related to the
academic educational advancement of the employee’s child, stepchild, foster
child, or ward who lives with the employee family member, such as a parent-
teacher conference.

child, or ward who lives with the employee or the employee’s parent, spouse,
or parent-in-law family member to routine medical or dental appointments.

family member to other appointments for professional services related to their
care and well-being.
