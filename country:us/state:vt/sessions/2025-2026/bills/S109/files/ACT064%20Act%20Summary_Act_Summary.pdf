Subjects: Criminal procedure; court procedure; miscellaneous amendments
This act makes a number of changes to court and Judiciary procedures, including

otherwise be prohibited by law; requiring the Court to provide licensed Vermont
attorneys in good standing with remote access to nonconfidential criminal, family, and

two percent of the total judgment; repealing the statute that prohibits possession and sale
of switchblade knives and expunging all existing convictions of the crime; making clear
that an intervenor must suffer physical harm while assisting a victim in order to obtain
compensation from the Crime Victims Compensation Program, and providing that

officer, firefighter, health care worker, Department for Children and Families employee,
or emergency medical personnel member; makes the result of a denial of a guardianship
petition identical to the result when the petition is withdrawn before the final hearing;
