5 Date:
6 Subject: Crimes; judiciary; sentencing; second look
7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to create a
8 procedure under which an incarcerated person serving a term of imprisonment
9 of at least 15 years who has served not less than 15 years may petition the
10 sentencing court for a reduction of the person’s term of imprisonment.
11 An act relating to second look sentencing
12 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
13 Sec. 1. FINDINGS AND INTENT
14 (a) Findings.
15 (1) According to the Vermont Department of Corrections, 20 percent of
16 the State’s incarcerated population of 851 sentenced offenders are serving life
17 sentences—151 persons with the possibility of parole and 14 persons serving
18 life without the possibility parole or a “virtual life sentence” of 50 years or
19 more.
VT LEG #381125 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.379

1 (2) Department of Corrections’ data shows that Vermont’s 20 percent
2 figure exceeds the national average, in which approximately one in seven
3 incarcerated persons are serving a life sentence.
4 (3) The Sentencing Project’s research demonstrates that Vermont’s
5 offenders subject to a life sentence increased by 11 percent between 2020 and
6 2024.
7 (4) According to the U.S. Census Bureau and other sources, the per
8 capita cost of incarceration in Vermont is $134,218.00.
9 (5) According to academic research, there are 52 persons with some
10 form of a life sentence who are 55 years of age or older, carrying an annual
11 care cost of $6,979,336.00, excluding care costs relating to common chronic
12 health conditions experienced by this population segment.
13 (b) Intent. It is the intent of the General Assembly to decrease the numbers
14 of incarcerated persons subject to a life sentence and reduce the costs
15 incarcerating this population by offering a “second look” at their sentences
16 through a judicial review by judges that permits granting relief from life
17 sentences for those persons who are deemed worthy of a reduced sentence.
18 Sec. 2. 13 V.S.A. § 7046 is added to read:
19 § 7046. SECOND LOOK SENTENCING
20 (a) Short title. This section may be cited as the “Second Look Sentencing
21 Act.”
