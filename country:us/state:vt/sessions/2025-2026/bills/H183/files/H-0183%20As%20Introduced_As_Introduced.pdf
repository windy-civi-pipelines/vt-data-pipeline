9 (a) Strict liability. The owner of a domestic dog has a duty to keep that dog
10 under reasonable control at all times and to keep that dog from running at
11 large. The owner may be held liable for any injury caused by the dog
12 regardless of whether the dog has shown any dangerous propensities or
13 whether the owner knew or should have known of the dog’s dangerous
14 propensities. A person who breaches the duty imposed by this section shall be
15 subject to civil liability for any damages suffered by a person who is injured by
16 the dog or whose domestic pet is injured by the dog while in a public place or
17 lawfully in or on the private property of another.
18 (b) Limitations on liability. Subsection (a) of this section shall not be
19 construed to impose liability upon:
20 (1) any governmental agency using a dog in military or police work if
21 the injury occurred during the course of the dog’s official duties; or

5 or another innocent party from attack by the injured person or a dog owned by
6 the injured person;
7 (C) the injury occurred while the dog was securely confined in a
8 kennel, a crate, or another enclosure; or
9 (D) the injury occurred as a result of the injured person enticing,
10 disturbing, alarming, harassing, or otherwise provoking the dog.
11 (c) Definitions. As used in this section:
12 (1) “Domestic pet” has the same meaning as in section 3541 of this title.
13 (2) “Owner” means a person who, at the time of the damage caused to
14 another, regularly harbors, keeps, or exercises control over the dog, but does
15 not include a person who, at the time of the damage, is temporarily harboring,
16 keeping, or exercising control over the dog.
17 (3) “Running at large” means a dog goes uncontrolled by the dog’s
18 owner upon the premises of another without the consent of the owner of the
19 premises or of another person authorized to give consent or goes uncontrolled
