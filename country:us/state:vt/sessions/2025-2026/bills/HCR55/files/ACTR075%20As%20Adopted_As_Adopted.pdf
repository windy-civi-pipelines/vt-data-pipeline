No. R-75. House concurrent resolution recognizing April 2025 as the Month of the
Military Child in Vermont.
(H.C.R.55)
Offered by All Members of the House
Whereas, many Americans and Vermonters may not be aware that there are more than
1.6 million children of U.S. military personnel, and
Whereas, family pressures are magnified for children who remain stateside when a
parent is deployed abroad, and the children of the approximately 1,000 Vermont National
Guard personnel who may be deployed over the course of a year experience this
disruption firsthand, and
Whereas, military children’s frequent relocation and corresponding lack of long-term
community stability present them with an unwelcome distraction, and
Whereas, in 1986, the U.S. Department of Defense first designated April as the Month
of the Military Child, and this annual event is part of a year-round initiative that brightens
and improves these children’s lives, and
Whereas, related programs include the national Military Kids Connect, partnerships
with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and 4-H Clubs, and Sesame Street for Military
Families, as well as many local activities that Vermont National Guard’s Child & Youth
Services and other offices administer, and
Whereas, as part of this special month, April 15, 2025 is being observed as Purple Up!
For Military Kids Day, an opportunity for Americans to show solidarity with military
families by wearing purple, a color that symbolizes all branches of the military, now
therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly recognizes April 2025 as the Month of the Military Child
in Vermont, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the Vermont National Guard Office of Child & Youth Services.
