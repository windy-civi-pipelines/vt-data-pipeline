Military Child in Vermont
Whereas, many Americans and Vermonters may not be aware that there are
more than 1.6 million children of U.S. military personnel, and
Whereas, family pressures are magnified for children who remain stateside
when a parent is deployed abroad, and the children of the approximately 1,000
Vermont National Guard personnel who may be deployed over the course of a
year experience this disruption firsthand, and
Whereas, military children’s frequent relocation and corresponding lack of
long-term community stability present them with an unwelcome
distraction, and
Whereas, in 1986, the U.S. Department of Defense first designated April as
the Month of the Military Child, and this annual event is part of a year-round
initiative that brightens and improves these children’s lives, and
Whereas, related programs include the national Military Kids Connect,
partnerships with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and 4-H Clubs, and
Sesame Street for Military Families, as well as many local activities that
Vermont National Guard’s Child & Youth Services and other offices
administer, and
Whereas, as part of this special month, April 15, 2025 is being observed as
Purple Up! For Military Kids Day, an opportunity for Americans to show
solidarity with military families by wearing purple, a color that symbolizes all
branches of the military, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly recognizes April 2025 as the Month of the
Military Child in Vermont, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this
resolution to the Vermont National Guard Office of Child & Youth Services.
