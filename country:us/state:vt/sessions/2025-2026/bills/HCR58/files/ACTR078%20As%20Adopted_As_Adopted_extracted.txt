Lineworker Appreciation Day in Vermont.

Offered by Representative Noyes of Wolcott
Offered by Senator Westman
Whereas, in the 21st century, electric power, which is overwhelmingly transmitted
through openly exposed local and long-distance electric power transmission lines, is
essential for all aspects of daily living, and
Whereas, when lightning, snow, wind, and other variants of disruptive weather strike,
the electric power lines are often damaged, posing an immediate danger to persons who
encounter the wires and disrupting the flow of electric power to neighborhoods, entire
municipalities, and even large sections of the State, including vital health and public
safety facilities, and
Whereas, these electric power disruptions trigger the response of the dedicated men
and women who are employees of Vermont’s cooperative, investor-owned, and
municipal utilities, the organizations that, for decades, have striven to provide all
Vermonters with reliable, safe, and, in more recent years, increasingly environmentally
friendly electric power, and
Whereas, these electric utility employees must work extended hours, under extremely
dangerous conditions that require the utmost degree of care and professionalism, in a
time-pressured effort to restore electric power expeditiously and eliminate dangerous
hazards on the landscape and byways of the State, and
Whereas, these individuals are truly unsung heroes, whose impact on our daily lives is
often forgotten and underappreciated, and
Whereas, across the country, April 18 is annually observed as National Lineman
Appreciation Day, and a Vermont commemoration is in order, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly recognizes April 18, 2025 as Electric Utility Lineworker
Appreciation Day in Vermont, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
each of the cooperative, investor-owned, and municipal electric utilities in Vermont.
