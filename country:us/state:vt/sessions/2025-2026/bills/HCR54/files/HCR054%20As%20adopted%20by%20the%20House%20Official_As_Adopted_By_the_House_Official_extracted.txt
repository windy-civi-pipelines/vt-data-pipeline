Offered by All Members of the House
Vermont President Thomas Paul Salmon
Whereas, born in Cleveland, Ohio, and raised in Massachusetts, Tom Salmon earned both undergraduate and
law school degrees from Boston College and a master’s in taxation law from New York University Law
School, and
Whereas, after completion of his education, he moved to Bellows Falls and commenced practicing law and
became active in the community, and
Whereas, in 1959, the voters of Rockingham elected him a justice of the peace and he was also appointed
that community’s legal counsel, and in 1963, he became a municipal judge, and
Whereas, Tom Salmon served as the member from Rockingham in the Vermont House of Representatives
from 1966 to 1970, serving as House Minority Leader, and
Whereas, in 1972, at literally the last moment, when it appeared that no candidate would file for the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination, Tom Salmon volunteered to launch his long-shot bid for candidacy, and
Whereas, in a truly astounding victory, Tom Salmon won 56 percent of the vote, becoming the State’s 75th
Governor, serving for two terms in an administration known for the theme “Vermont is not for sale” and
initiatives tackling property taxrates, and
Whereas, Tom Salmon remained a prominent citizen whose adroit leadership would be called upon
frequently, including as Chair of the Green Mountain Power Board of Directors, and
Whereas, in 1991, the University of Vermont (UVM) Board of Trustees requested that he serve as Interim
UVM President; and in this office, which he described as “an honor and challenge,” his six-year tenure steadied
the governance of UVM and prepared the campus for the future, and
Whereas, former Governor Tom Salmon’s long, active, and highly productive life ended on January 14,
2025 at 92 years of age, and his survivors include his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren,
now therefore be it

That the General Assembly extends its sincere condolences to the family of former Representative,
