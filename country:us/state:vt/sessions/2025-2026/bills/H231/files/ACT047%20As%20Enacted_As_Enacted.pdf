Secretary shall disclose information regarding the location of the threatened or
endangered species to:
(1) to the owner of land upon which the species is located;
(2) to a potential buyer of land upon which the species is located who
has a bona fide contract to buy the land and applies to the Secretary for
disclosure of threatened or endangered species information; or

(3) to qualified individuals or organizations, public agencies, and
nonprofit organizations for scientific research or for preservation and planning
purposes when the Secretary determines that the preservation of the species is
not further endangered by the disclosure; or
(4) during regulatory processes with the exception of threatened or
endangered species listed under subsection (b) of this section.
(b) The Secretary shall maintain a subset list of threatened and endangered
species whose specific names shall not be included in regulatory planning.
The subset list shall include threatened or endangered species for which the
species names and locations shall not be disclosed because of the risk that the
species will be significantly harmed by unauthorized take, such as illegal
collection, commercial trade, human-caused mortality, or destruction of
habitat. The list shall be based on the rarity of the species, known collection
and commercial trade activities in Vermont and other states or countries,
incidents of human-caused mortality or destruction of habitat, and other factors
that present a threat to the continued existence of the species.
(c) When the Secretary issues a permit under this chapter to take a
threatened or endangered species or destroy or adversely impact critical habitat
and when the Secretary designates critical habitat by rule under section 5402a
of this title, the Secretary shall disclose only the municipality and general
location where the threatened or endangered species or designated critical
habitat is located. When the Secretary designates critical habitat under section
VT LEG #384189 v.1

No. 47 Page 24 of 31
2025
5402a of this title, the Secretary shall notify the municipality in which the
critical habitat is located and shall disclose the general location of the
designated critical habitat.

§ 4829. PERSON SUFFERING DAMAGE BY DEER OR BLACK BEAR
(a) A person engaged in the business of farming who suffers damage by
deer to the person’s crops, fruit trees, or crop-bearing plants on land not posted
against the hunting of deer, or a person engaged in the business of farming who
suffers damage by black bear to the person’s cattle, sheep, swine, poultry, or
bees or bee hives on land not posted against hunting or trapping of black bear

reasonable person to believe that hunting is prohibited on the land.
(b) As used in this section, a person is “engaged in the business of farming”
if he or she earns at least one-half of the farmer’s annual gross income from the
business of farming, as that term is defined in the Internal Revenue Code, 26
