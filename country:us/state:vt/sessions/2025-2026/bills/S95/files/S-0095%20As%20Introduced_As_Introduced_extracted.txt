13 and convincing evidence that:

14 child.

16 § 2628. GUARDIANSHIP ORDER

13 and convincing evidence that:

16 immigration action that renders the parent unavailable to care for the child;
17 (2) the child’s custodial parents knowingly and voluntarily consented to
18 the standby guardianship;

12 consistent with the terms of the parties’ agreement unless the court finds that
13 the agreement was not reached voluntarily or is not in the best interests of the
14 child.
15 Sec. 5. 14 V.S.A. § 2628 is amended to read:
16 § 2628. GUARDIANSHIP ORDER
