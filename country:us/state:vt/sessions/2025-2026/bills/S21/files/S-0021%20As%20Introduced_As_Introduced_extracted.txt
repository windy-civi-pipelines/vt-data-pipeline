6 Subject: Education; cell phone-free schools
7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to prohibit the
8 use of cell phones and personal electronic devices during the school day in
9 public schools, independent schools, career and technical education centers,
10 and prequalified private prekindergarten programs, as well as to prohibit
11 schools from communicating with students through social media.
12 An act relating to cell phone-free schools
13 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
14 Sec. 1. FINDINGS
15 (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds that:
16 (1) The National Education Association reported in August 2024 that 83
17 percent of its members support a policy to prohibit use of cell phones and
18 personal electronic devices for the entire school day.
19 (2) In June 2024, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy called on
20 Congress to pass legislation requiring warning labels on social media because

1 these products have not been proven safe for children. He also called on
2 schools to “ensure that classroom learning and social time are phone-free
3 experiences.”
4 (3) Youth in Vermont are in a mental health crisis. According to the
5 2023 Vermont Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), 63 percent of high
6 school students said that their mental health was sometimes to always “not
7 good.” Suicide is the second leading cause of death for Vermont’s youth.
8 (4) The youth mental health crisis is driving up education costs in
9 Vermont. A 2024 Legislative Education Costs Survey conducted by the
10 Vermont Agency of Education found that the number of positions dedicated to
11 mental and behavioral health in the 48 responding supervisory unions and
12 districts was 142 in fiscal year 2022. By fiscal year 2025, that number had
13 risen to 790. Extrapolated to include the remaining four remaining supervisory
14 unions, those positions account for close to $53,000,000.00 of education
15 spending.
16 (5) The Vermont YRBS also found that 80 percent of high school
17 students use social media several times a day, with 40 percent using social
18 media at least one time every hour. 60 percent of middle school students
19 reported using social media several times a day, with 32 percent using it at
20 least once per hour.

1 (6) Phone-free policies have been shown to reduce the incidence of
2 hazing, harassment, and bullying in some schools. Lamoille South
3 Supervisory Union instituted a phone-free school day policy in August 2024.
4 Data from one of the supervisory union’s high schools showed nine hazing,
5 harassment, and bullying claims from August to October 2023, before the
6 policy, and just two such claims during the same period in 2024, after the
7 policy was enacted.
8 (7) Use of social media by school employees runs the risk of violating
9 the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Given this risk, as well as the
10 growing body of research that shows social media is not safe for kids, schools
11 and students are best served by utilizing communication tools other than social
12 media.
13 (8) As of November 2024, eight states have passed laws that ban or
14 restrict cell phone use in schools.
15 (b) Intent. It is the intent of the General Assembly for all students in
16 Vermont to access the benefits of a phone- and social media-free school
17 environment, which promotes focus, improved mental health, and increased
18 social cohesion.
