Act No. 56 (H.321). An act relating to miscellaneous cannabis amendments
Subjects: Cannabis; cannabis establishments
This act is the annual Cannabis Control Board (CCB) housekeeping bill and makes a
number of changes related to the licensing and regulation of cannabis establishments.
Highlights include:
• Clarification that law enforcement may seize cannabis that is illegal pursuant
to administrative rule duly adopted by the CCB, such as products containing
synthetic cannabinoids (Delta-8 THC).
• Small amendments to the language authorizing the CCB to obtain fingerprint-
supported criminal history records from the FBI database for persons licensed
by the CCB.
• Authority for the CCB to issue a special permit temporarily authorizing a
licensed or unlicensed designee of suitable ability and judgment to temporarily
operate a cannabis establishment, or to possess, transport, or dispose of
cannabis and cannabis products, as specified by the terms of the permit, in
cases of incapacity of a principal, dysfunction, operating distress, interruption
in licensure, abrupt closure, or judicial intervention including receivership.
• Permission for cannabis propagation licensees to test, transport, and sell
cannabis clones and immature cannabis plants to licensed retailers.
• Removal of a requirement in previous legislation for the State Auditor to report
to the General Assembly on the structure of the CCB.
The act also requires the CCB to submit a report to the General Assembly regarding
current and projected fees and a recommendation regarding how the cannabis
establishment fee schedule as set forth in 7 V.S.A. § 910 may be adjusted to better
promote the intent of the General Assembly to encourage participation in the regulated
cannabis market by small local farmers and social equity applicants. The report shall also
recommend whether a portion of the cannabis excise tax established pursuant to 32
V.S.A. § 7902 should be allocated to the Cannabis Business Development Fund for uses
as provided pursuant to 7 V.S.A. § 987 and the Vermont Land Access and Opportunity
Board to fulfill the duties of the Board.
Effective Date: July 1, 2025
