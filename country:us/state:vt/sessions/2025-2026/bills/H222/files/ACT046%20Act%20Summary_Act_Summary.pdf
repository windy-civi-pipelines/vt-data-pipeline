Act No. 46 (H.222). An act relating to civil orders of protection
Subjects: Domestic relations; abuse prevention
This act makes a number of changes to the statutes concerning civil orders of
protection.
Vermont law provides a process whereby a person who is alleged to have been
subjected to stalking or sexual assault can obtain a civil order of protection if the person
is not eligible to obtain a domestic violence order because the alleged perpetrator was not
a family or household member. This act amends the definition of stalking by specifically
including behavior that is conducted through the use of technology. This definition
would also apply to domestic violence civil orders of protection through the cross-
reference provided in 15 V.S.A. § 1101.
The act amends the law regarding final domestic violence civil orders of protection by
authorizing the court, after a hearing, to award possession of a vehicle to the plaintiff for
a set period of time. In cases of temporary emergency domestic violence civil orders of
protection, the court may award temporary possession of a vehicle to a plaintiff upon a
finding that the plaintiff’s possession of a vehicle is necessary to escape abuse or prevent
further abuse. The additional requirement of the finding in cases of emergency orders are
because the orders are issued ex parte.
The act also authorizes the court to order a defendant in a final domestic violence
order to complete a domestic violence accountability program approved by the Council
on Domestic Violence. Unlike other conditions of a final order, a violation of this
condition would not be a crime under 13 V.S.A. § 1030 but may subject the defendant to
civil contempt proceedings pursuant to Rule 16 of the Vermont Rules of Family
Proceedings. The act requires the Domestic Violence Fatality Review Commission to
include in its biennial report the number of defendants ordered to complete a domestic
violence accountability program approved by the Council on Domestic Violence and the
number of those defendants who completed the program.
