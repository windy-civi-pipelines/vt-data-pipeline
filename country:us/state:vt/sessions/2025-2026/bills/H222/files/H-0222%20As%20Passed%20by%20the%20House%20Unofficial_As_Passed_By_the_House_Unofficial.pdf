3 the purpose of making contact with the plaintiff, including in writing or by
4 telephone, e-mail email, or other electronic communication; or

4 court, the names of the parties, the date of the petition, and the date and time of
5 the order and shall be signed by the judge. Every order issued under this
6 section shall inform the defendant that if he or she the defendant fails to appear
7 at the final hearing, the temporary order will remain in effect until the final
8 order is served on the defendant unless the temporary order is dismissed by the
9 court. Every order issued under this section shall state upon its face a date,
10 time, and place when the defendant may appear to petition the court for
11 modification or discharge of the order. This opportunity to contest shall be
12 scheduled as soon as reasonably possible, which in no event shall be more than
13 14 days from the date of issuance of the order. At such hearings, the plaintiff
14 shall have the burden of proving abuse by a preponderance of the evidence. If
15 the court finds that the plaintiff has met his or her the burden, it shall continue
16 the order in effect and make such other order as it deems necessary to protect
17 the plaintiff.
