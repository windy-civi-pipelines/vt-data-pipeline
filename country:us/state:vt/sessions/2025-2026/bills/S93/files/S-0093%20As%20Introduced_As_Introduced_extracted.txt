9 (b) The consumer may designate an authorized agent by way of, among
10 other things, a technology, including an internet link or a browser setting,
11 browser extension, or global device setting, indicating the consumer’s intent to

2 relevant, and reasonably necessary in relation to the purposes for which the
3 data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer;
4 (2) except as otherwise provided in this chapter, shall not process

18 and federal laws that prohibit unlawful discrimination against consumers;
19 (6) shall provide an effective mechanism for a consumer to revoke the

21 by which the consumer provided the consumer’s consent and, upon revocation
VT LEG #380226 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.93
2025 Page 24 of 45
1 of the consent, cease to process the data as soon as practicable, but not later
2 than 15 days after the receipt of the request;
3 (7) shall not process the personal data of a consumer for purposes of
4 targeted advertising, or sell the consumer’s personal data without the

12 (b) Subsection (a) of this section shall not be construed to require a
13 controller to provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a
14 consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain, or prohibit a
15 controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of
16 goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no

19 program.
20 (c) A controller shall provide consumers with a reasonably accessible,
21 clear, and meaningful privacy notice that includes:
VT LEG #380226 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.93
2025 Page 25 of 45
1 (1) the categories of personal data processed by the controller;
2 (2) the purpose for processing personal data;
3 (3) how consumers may exercise their consumer rights, including how a

14 disclose the processing, as well as the manner in which a consumer may
15 exercise the right to opt out of the processing.
16 (e)(1) A controller shall establish, and shall describe in a privacy notice,
17 one or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit a request to
18 exercise their consumer rights pursuant to this chapter.

VT LEG #380226 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.93

1 communication of the requests, and the ability of the controller to verify the
2 identity of the consumer making the request.
3 (3) A controller shall not require a consumer to create a new account in
4 order to exercise consumer rights but may require a consumer to use an
5 existing account.
6 (4)(A) The means shall include:
7 (i) providing a clear and conspicuous link on the controller’s
8 website to an web page that enables a consumer, or an agent of the consumer,
9 to opt out of the targeted advertising or sale of the consumer’s personal data;
10 and
11 (ii) not later than January 1, 2026, allowing a consumer to opt out
12 of any processing of the consumer’s personal data for the purposes of targeted
13 advertising, or any sale of the personal data, through an opt-out preference
14 signal sent to the controller with the consumer’s consent indicating the
15 consumer’s intent to opt out of any the processing or sale, by a platform,
16 technology, or other mechanism that shall:
17 (I) not unfairly disadvantage another controller;
18 (II) not make use of a default setting, but rather require the
19 consumer to make an affirmative, freely given, and unambiguous choice to opt
20 out of any processing of the consumer’s personal data pursuant to this chapter;
VT LEG #380226 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.93
2025 Page 27 of 45
1 (III) be consumer-friendly and easy to use by the average
2 consumer;
3 (IV) be as consistent as possible with any other similar
4 platform, technology, or mechanism required by any federal or State law or
5 regulation; and
6 (V) enable the controller to accurately determine whether the
7 consumer is a resident of this State and whether the consumer has made a
8 legitimate request to opt out of any sale of the consumer’s personal data or
9 targeted advertising.
10 (B) If a consumer’s decision to opt out of any processing of the
11 consumer’s personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, or any sale
12 of the personal data, through an opt-out preference signal sent in accordance
13 with the provisions of subdivision (A) of this subdivision (e)(4) conflicts with
14 the consumer’s existing controller-specific privacy setting or voluntary
15 participation in a controller’s bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features,
16 discounts, or club card program, the controller shall comply with the
17 consumer’s opt-out preference signal but may notify the consumer of the
18 conflict and provide to the consumer the choice to confirm the controller-
19 specific privacy setting or participation in the program.
20 (5) If a controller responds to consumer opt-out requests received
21 pursuant to subdivision (4)(A) of this subsection by informing the consumer of

10 available to the processor, by appropriate technical and organizational
11 measures, to the extent reasonably practicable, to fulfill the controller’s
12 obligation to respond to consumer rights requests;
13 (2) taking into account the nature of processing and the information
14 available to the processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the
15 controller’s obligations in relation to the security of processing the personal
16 data and in relation to the notification of a data broker security breach or
17 security breach, as defined in section 2430 of this title, of the system of the
18 processor, in order to meet the controller’s obligations; and
19 (3) providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct
20 and document data protection assessments.
VT LEG #380226 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.93
2025 Page 29 of 45
1 (b)(1) A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the
2 processor’s data processing procedures with respect to processing performed
3 on behalf of the controller.
4 (2) The contract shall be binding and clearly set forth instructions for
5 processing data, the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject
6 to processing, the duration of processing, and the rights and obligations of both
7 parties.
8 (3) The contract shall require that the processor:
9 (A) ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a
10 duty of confidentiality with respect to the data;
11 (B) at the controller’s direction, delete or return all personal data to
12 the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless
13 retention of the personal data is required by law;
14 (C) upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to
15 the controller all information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the
16 processor’s compliance with the obligations in this chapter;
17 (D) after providing the controller an opportunity to object, engage
18 any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract that requires the subcontractor
19 to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data; and

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.93
2025 Page 30 of 45
1 (E) make available to the controller upon the reasonable request of

3 demonstrate the processor’s compliance with this chapter.
4 (4) A processor shall provide a report of an assessment to the controller
5 upon request.
6 (c) This section shall not be construed to relieve a controller or processor
7 from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by virtue of the
8 controller’s or processor’s role in the processing relationship, as described in
9 this chapter.
10 (d)(1) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor
11 with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that
12 depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed.
13 (2) A person who is not limited in the person’s processing of personal
14 data pursuant to a controller’s instructions, or who fails to adhere to the
15 instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to a specific
16 processing of data.
17 (3) A processor that continues to adhere to a controller’s instructions
18 with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor.
19 (4) If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the
20 purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor is a

1 controller with respect to the processing and may be subject to an enforcement
2 action under section 2425 of this title.

7 of harm to a consumer, which for the purposes of this section includes:
8 (1) the processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted
9 advertising;
10 (2) the sale of personal data;
11 (3) the processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, where

14 consumers;
15 (B) financial, physical, or reputational injury to consumers;
16 (C) a physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the

18 offensive to a reasonable person; or
19 (D) other substantial injury to consumers; and
20 (4) the processing of sensitive data.
VT LEG #380226 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.93
2025 Page 32 of 45
1 (b)(1) Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (a) of
2 this section shall identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and
3 indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other
4 stakeholders, and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the
5 consumer associated with the processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can
6 be employed by the controller to reduce the risks.
7 (2) The controller shall factor into any data protection assessment the
8 use of de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well
9 as the context of the processing and the relationship between the controller and
10 the consumer whose personal data will be processed.
11 (c)(1) The Attorney General may require that a controller disclose any data
12 protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the
13 Attorney General, and the controller shall make the data protection assessment

16 for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in this chapter.
17 (3) Data protection assessments shall be confidential and shall be
18 exempt from disclosure and copying under the Public Records Act.

20 assessment disclosed to the Attorney General includes information subject to
VT LEG #380226 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.93
2025 Page 33 of 45
1 attorney-client privilege or work product protection, the disclosure shall not
2 constitute a waiver of the privilege or protection.
3 (d) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of
4 processing operations that include similar activities.
5 (e) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of
6 complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection
7 assessment shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements established in this
8 section if the data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and
9 effect to the data protection assessment that would otherwise be conducted
10 pursuant to this section.
11 (f) Data protection assessment requirements shall apply to processing
12 activities created or generated after July 1, 2025 and are not retroactive.

17 (1) take reasonable measures to ensure that the data cannot be associated
18 with an individual;
19 (2) publicly commit to maintaining and using de-identified data without
20 attempting to re-identify the data; and

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.93
2025 Page 34 of 45
1 (3) contractually obligate any recipients of the de-identified data to
2 comply with the provisions of this chapter.
3 (b) This chapter shall not be construed to:
4 (1) require a controller or processor to re-identify de-identified data or
5 pseudonymous data; or
6 (2) maintain data in identifiable form, or collect, obtain, retain, or access
7 any data or technology, in order to be capable of associating an authenticated
8 consumer request with personal data.
9 (c) This chapter shall not be construed to require a controller or processor
10 to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if the controller:
11 (1) is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal
12 data or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the
13 request with the personal data;
14 (2) does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the specific
15 consumer who is the subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data
16 with other personal data about the same specific consumer; and
17 (3) does not sell the personal data to any third party or otherwise
18 voluntarily disclose the personal data to any third party other than a processor,
19 except as otherwise permitted in this section.
20 (d) The rights afforded under subdivisions 2418(a)(1)–(4) of this title shall
21 not apply to pseudonymous data in cases where the controller is able to
VT LEG #380226 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.93
2025 Page 35 of 45
1 demonstrate that any information necessary to identify the consumer is kept
2 separately and is subject to effective technical and organizational controls that
3 prevent the controller from accessing the information.
4 (e) A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or de-identified data
5 shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any contractual
6 commitments to which the pseudonymous data or de-identified data is subject
7 and shall take appropriate steps to address any breaches of those contractual
8 commitments.

12 confidentiality obligations under federal, state, or local law.
13 (b) The obligations imposed on controllers, processors, or consumer health
14 data controllers under this chapter shall not restrict a controller’s, processor’s,

4 controller, or are otherwise compatible with processing data in furtherance of
5 the provision of a product or service specifically requested by a consumer or
6 the performance of a contract to which the consumer is a party.
7 (c)(1) The obligations imposed on controllers, processors, or consumer
8 health data controllers under this chapter shall not apply where compliance by

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.93
2025 Page 24 of 45
1 of the consent, cease to process the data as soon as practicable, but not later
2 than 15 days after the receipt of the request;
3 (7) shall not process the personal data of a consumer for purposes of
4 targeted advertising, or sell the consumer’s personal data without the
5 consumer’s consent, under circumstances where a controller has actual
6 knowledge, and willfully disregards, that the consumer is at least 13 years of
7 age but younger than 16 years of age; and
8 (8) shall not discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the

14 consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain, or prohibit a
15 controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of
16 goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no

21 clear, and meaningful privacy notice that includes:
VT LEG #380226 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.93
2025 Page 25 of 45
1 (1) the categories of personal data processed by the controller;
2 (2) the purpose for processing personal data;
3 (3) how consumers may exercise their consumer rights, including how a

15 exercise the right to opt out of the processing.
16 (e)(1) A controller shall establish, and shall describe in a privacy notice,
17 one or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit a request to
18 exercise their consumer rights pursuant to this chapter.

1 communication of the requests, and the ability of the controller to verify the
2 identity of the consumer making the request.
3 (3) A controller shall not require a consumer to create a new account in
4 order to exercise consumer rights but may require a consumer to use an
5 existing account.
6 (4)(A) The means shall include:

10 and
11 (ii) not later than January 1, 2026, allowing a consumer to opt out
12 of any processing of the consumer’s personal data for the purposes of targeted
13 advertising, or any sale of the personal data, through an opt-out preference
14 signal sent to the controller with the consumer’s consent indicating the
15 consumer’s intent to opt out of any the processing or sale, by a platform,
16 technology, or other mechanism that shall:
17 (I) not unfairly disadvantage another controller;
18 (II) not make use of a default setting, but rather require the
19 consumer to make an affirmative, freely given, and unambiguous choice to opt
20 out of any processing of the consumer’s personal data pursuant to this chapter;
VT LEG #380226 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.93

11 consumer’s personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, or any sale
12 of the personal data, through an opt-out preference signal sent in accordance

14 the consumer’s existing controller-specific privacy setting or voluntary
15 participation in a controller’s bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features,
16 discounts, or club card program, the controller shall comply with the
17 consumer’s opt-out preference signal but may notify the consumer of the
18 conflict and provide to the consumer the choice to confirm the controller-
19 specific privacy setting or participation in the program.
20 (5) If a controller responds to consumer opt-out requests received

11 measures, to the extent reasonably practicable, to fulfill the controller’s
12 obligation to respond to consumer rights requests;
13 (2) taking into account the nature of processing and the information
14 available to the processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the
15 controller’s obligations in relation to the security of processing the personal
16 data and in relation to the notification of a data broker security breach or
17 security breach, as defined in section 2430 of this title, of the system of the
18 processor, in order to meet the controller’s obligations; and
19 (3) providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct

6 to processing, the duration of processing, and the rights and obligations of both
7 parties.
8 (3) The contract shall require that the processor:
9 (A) ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a
10 duty of confidentiality with respect to the data;
11 (B) at the controller’s direction, delete or return all personal data to
12 the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless

6 (c) This section shall not be construed to relieve a controller or processor
7 from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by virtue of the
8 controller’s or processor’s role in the processing relationship, as described in
9 this chapter.
10 (d)(1) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor
11 with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that
12 depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed.
13 (2) A person who is not limited in the person’s processing of personal
14 data pursuant to a controller’s instructions, or who fails to adhere to the
15 instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to a specific

1 (b)(1) Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (a) of
2 this section shall identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and
3 indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other
4 stakeholders, and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the
5 consumer associated with the processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can
6 be employed by the controller to reduce the risks.
7 (2) The controller shall factor into any data protection assessment the
8 use of de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well
9 as the context of the processing and the relationship between the controller and
10 the consumer whose personal data will be processed.
11 (c)(1) The Attorney General may require that a controller disclose any data
12 protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the
13 Attorney General, and the controller shall make the data protection assessment

2 constitute a waiver of the privilege or protection.
3 (d) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of
4 processing operations that include similar activities.
5 (e) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of
6 complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection
7 assessment shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements established in this
8 section if the data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and
9 effect to the data protection assessment that would otherwise be conducted
10 pursuant to this section.
11 (f) Data protection assessment requirements shall apply to processing
12 activities created or generated after July 1, 2025 and are not retroactive.

4 (1) require a controller or processor to re-identify de-identified data or
5 pseudonymous data; or
6 (2) maintain data in identifiable form, or collect, obtain, retain, or access
7 any data or technology, in order to be capable of associating an authenticated
8 consumer request with personal data.
9 (c) This chapter shall not be construed to require a controller or processor
10 to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if the controller:
11 (1) is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal
12 data or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the
13 request with the personal data;
14 (2) does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the specific
15 consumer who is the subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data
16 with other personal data about the same specific consumer; and
17 (3) does not sell the personal data to any third party or otherwise
18 voluntarily disclose the personal data to any third party other than a processor,
19 except as otherwise permitted in this section.

5 shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any contractual
6 commitments to which the pseudonymous data or de-identified data is subject
7 and shall take appropriate steps to address any breaches of those contractual
8 commitments.
