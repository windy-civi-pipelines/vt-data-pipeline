Whereas, the cheerleading tradition at Rutland High School is legendary, as prior to
2025, Rutland had won the Division I championship for each of the last 10 years, a
distinction of consecutive victories it shared only with Essex High School, and
Whereas, as Rutland embarked on the 2024–2025 cheerleading season, the squad
lacked the seasoned experience of seniors and welcomed four first-timers to the team, and
although the Rutland cheerleaders were optimistic as they traveled to the State
Championship tournament in Vergennes, they appreciated the challenge to be
surmounted, and
Whereas, these enthusiastic and highly prepared Rutlanders exhibited great team and
musical coordination, performed exciting routines, and gave a truly spectacular
presentation, and they convincingly won a record-setting 11th consecutive Division I
crown, outpacing second-place South Burlington 173–154.5, and
Whereas, the thrilled team members were Ava Grant, Kylenne Gurney, Bahija
Ettouzar, Caroline Giordano, Lexi Juarez, Lexianna Napolitano, Michelle Colomb,
Savannah Wade, Sofia Lind, Teagan Smith, Isabella Perez, Julia Short, Maeuve
Saunders, Mya Stanley, Sophia Blehar, and Paige Lohsen, and
Whereas, coaches Cara Gauvin and Kayla Beaudry were extremely proud, now
therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the Rutland High School cheerleading
program on winning a record 11th consecutive Division I championship, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Rutland High School.
