House concurrent resolution congratulating the Rutland High School cheerleading program on winning a
record 11th consecutive Division I championship
Whereas, the cheerleading tradition at Rutland High School is legendary, as prior to 2025, Rutland had won
the Division I championship for each of the last 10 years, a distinction of consecutive victories it shared only
with EssexHigh School, and
Whereas, as Rutland embarked on the 2024–2025 cheerleading season, the squad lacked the seasoned
experience of seniors and welcomed four first-timers to the team, and although the Rutland cheerleaders were
optimistic as they traveled to the State Championship tournament in Vergennes, they appreciated the challenge
to be surmounted, and
Whereas, these enthusiastic and highly prepared Rutlanders exhibited great team and musical coordination,
performed exciting routines, and gave a truly spectacular presentation, and they convincingly won a record-
setting 11th consecutive Division I crown, outpacing second-place South Burlington 173–154.5, and
Whereas, the thrilled team members were Ava Grant, Kylenne Gurney, Bahija Ettouzar, Caroline Giordano,
Lexi Juarez, Lexianna Napolitano, Michelle Colomb, Savannah Wade, Sofia Lind, Teagan Smith, Isabella
Perez, Julia Short, Maeuve Saunders, Mya Stanley, Sophia Blehar, and Paige Lohsen, and
Whereas, coaches Cara Gauvin and Kayla Beaudry were extremely proud, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the Rutland High School cheerleading program on winning a
record 11th consecutive Division I championship, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to Rutland High School.
