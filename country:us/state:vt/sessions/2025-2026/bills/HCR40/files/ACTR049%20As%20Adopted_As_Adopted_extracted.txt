Whereas, the three most northeastern Vermont counties—Caledonia, Essex, and
Orleans—represent a distinct region of the Green Mountain State known as the Northeast
Kingdom (NEK), which should be treated distinctly, as its rural nature has unique
strengths and challenges, and
Whereas, throughout the NEK, there are tremendous natural assets, with extensive
forest tracts, mountain vistas, farms and cropland, and beautiful scenery, and
Whereas, the NEK is the least populous region of Vermont, but nonetheless contains
55 towns and gores and more than 60,000 residents who form resilient and vibrant
communities, and
Whereas, the synergies of world-class outdoor recreation, including great trails,
beautiful parks, the Nulhegan Basin Refuge of the Silvio O. Conte National Fish and
Wildlife Refuge, and the State’s Kingdom Heritage Lands; a thriving food, farm, and
forestry sector; and a robust creative economy enhance the NEK’s economy and quality
of life for residents and the many visitors attracted to the region, and
Whereas, there is a strong entrepreneurial spirit in the NEK, with growing
resources for small businesses and remote work, a vibrant manufacturing and industrial
sector, and many opportunities for expansion and growth, and
Whereas, among the outstanding educational institutions in the NEK are St. Johnsbury
Academy, Lyndon Institute, Vermont State University-Lyndon, and Sterling
College, and
Whereas, despite persistent economic and demographic challenges, including higher
rates of poverty and unemployment than elsewhere in Vermont; climate change; and a
shifting population base, the NEK moves forward optimistically with determination,
collaboration, and an exciting sense of possibility, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly designates February 20, 2025 as NEK Day at the State
House, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the Northeast Kingdom Collaborative.
