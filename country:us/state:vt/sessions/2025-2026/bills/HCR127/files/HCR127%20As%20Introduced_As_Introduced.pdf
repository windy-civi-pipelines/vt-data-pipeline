House of Representatives
Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 127
Offered by Representative Emmons of Springfield
Offered by Senator Cummings
House concurrent resolution commemorating the 25th anniversary of Act 91 of 2000, establishing Vermont
as the first state to legalize civil unions
Whereas, on December 20, 1999, the Vermont Supreme Court issued the landmark decision, Baker v. State,
170 Vt. 194, holding that the exclusion of same-sexcouples from access to the benefits and rights of marriage
licenses under Vermont’s law violated the Common Benefits Clause of the Vermont Constitution, and
Whereas, the Court allowed the General Assembly to consider and enact legislation consistent with the
constitutional mandate described in its decision that could be civil marriage or a different legal status that
delivered “the common benefits and protections that flow from marriage under Vermont law,” and
Whereas, in 2000, the House Committee on Judiciary, after researching the law and history of marriage and
taking testimony from hundreds of witnesses offering differing viewpoints, introduced H.847 to establish the
legal status of civil union for gay and lesbian couples, and
Whereas, on March 16, 2000, after intense and extensive debate, the House advanced the bill to the
Senate, and
Whereas, the Senate Committee on Judiciary conducted a vigorous review of the House’s work, took
testimony from people across the State, revised the bill, and on April 19, 2000, approved an amended
version, and
Whereas, on April 25, 2000, the House concurred with the Senate amendments, sending the bill to Governor
Howard Dean, who, on April 26, 2000, signed H.847 into law as Act 91, and
Whereas, without the Vermonters who risked their safety and more to challenge Vermont’s marriage law, in
particular, the Baker case plaintiffs, Stan Baker and Peter Harrigan, Nina Beck and Stacy Jolles, and Lois
Farnham and Holly Puterbaugh, and their attorneys, Beth Robinson, Susan M. Murray, and Mary Bonauto, Act
91 would never have been enacted, and
Whereas, Vermont was the first state in the nation to enact civil unions legislation, and Act 91 was the
foundation for the enactment of Act 3 of 2009, the nation’s first marriage equality statute, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly commemorates the 25th anniversary of Act 91 of 2000 establishing Vermont as
the first state to legalize civil unions, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the Baker v. State
plaintiffs and their attorneys, to the Pride Center of Vermont, and to Outright Vermont.
