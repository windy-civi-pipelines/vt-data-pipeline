House resolution urging that all State agencies, departments, and offices
protect the civil rights, medical confidentiality, and all aspects of personal
privacy of Vermonters who have been diagnosed with autism in light of the
Secretary of the U.S. Health and Human Services’ recently announced plans to
establish an autism research database and other databases related to autism
Whereas, the State of Vermont is fully committed to ensuring the
enforcement of the rights of individuals with disabilities and the provision of
inclusive services and person-centered systems of care, and
Whereas, individuals with autism contribute their talents, perspectives, and
problem-solving abilities to strengthen Vermont’s workforce; enrich families
and communities; and advance innovation in science, technology, the arts, and
beyond, and
Whereas, autism is a neurological difference, not a disease or an epidemic,
and
Whereas, the rising autism identification rates, which trained clinicians and
health care professionals are documenting, are attributable to improved
diagnostic practices, greater awareness of autism, and expanded access to
screening tools, and
Whereas, individuals with disabilities, including individuals with autism,
are too often stigmatized and underestimated, and public policy should never
diminish the diverse strengths and potential of these Vermonters, and
Whereas, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has announced plans to establish a federal
research database intended to be used to investigate the root causes of autism,
and
Whereas, this new database will be a compilation of information derived
from individuals’ insurance claims; electronic medical records; and wearable
devices, such as smart watches, and
Whereas, although this new database is no longer characterized as an
“autism registry,” as Secretary Kennedy and National Institutes of Health
Director, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, had previously announced, and despite public
promises of personal and medical privacy, significant concerns remain
regarding the potential use of Vermonters’ sensitive, personally identifiable
health care information without their specific and informed consent, and
Whereas, the Governor of the State of Illinois has issued Executive Order
2025-02 (the EO) to ensure that Illinois state officials fully comply with all
applicable state and federal legal privacy protections in matters affecting the
collection and use of information of persons being tested for, or who have been
diagnosed with, autism, or in any database that now or may in the future exist
that includes personal information related to autism; that the information not
be collected, unless dong so is strictly necessary for authorized purposes; and
that the information not be disclosed outside state government except if one of
the conditions listed in the EO is met, and
Whereas, it is imperative that Vermont officials are similarly vigilant in
their protection of personal data being collected for any type of analysis or
assessment related to autism, now therefore be it
Resolved by the House of Representatives:
That this legislative body urges that all State agencies, departments, and
offices do everything in their power to protect the civil rights, medical
confidentiality, and all aspects of personal privacy of Vermonters who have
been diagnosed with autism, and be it further
Resolved: That the Clerk of the House be directed to send a copy of this
resolution to the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Director of
the National Institutes of Health, the Vermont Congressional Delegation, the
Vermont Secretary of Human Services, the Vermont Human Rights
Commission, and the Governor.
