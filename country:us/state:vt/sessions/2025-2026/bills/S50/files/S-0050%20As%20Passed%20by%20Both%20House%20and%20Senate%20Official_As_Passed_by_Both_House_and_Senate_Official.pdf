establishing these standards and procedures:
* * *
(F) This subdivision (F) applies to an application for a net metering
system with a capacity that is greater than 15 25 kilowatts, unless the system is
located on a new or existing structure the primary purpose of which is not the
generation of electricity. With respect to such a system, the rules shall not
waive or include provisions that are less stringent than each of the following:
(i) the requirement of subdivision 248(a)(4)(C) of this title to
provide a copy of the application to the Agencies of Agriculture, Food and
Markets and of Natural Resources; the Department of Public Service; the
Division for Historic Preservation; the municipal legislative body; and the
municipal and regional planning commissions; and
(ii) the requirements of subsection 248(f) (preapplication
submittal) of this title.
(G) The rules shall establish an expedited registration procedure for
net metering systems up to 25 kilowatts25 kilowatts and less in size.
* * *
Sec. 2. RULEMAKING
The Public Utility Commission shall update its Rule 5.100 to allow ground
mounted photovoltaic net metering systems of not more than 25 kW of 25

§ 4412. REQUIRED PROVISIONS AND PROHIBITED EFFECTS
* * *
(15) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of sections 2291a and
4413 of this title or 30 V.S.A. chapter 5 or 89, in a municipality that has
adopted a bylaw to establish setback requirements for development, those
requirements shall apply to a net metering system that is 25 kW or less in size
that has been registered with the Public Utility Commission as part of
expedited review under 30 V.S.A. § 248. Setback requirements under this
subdivision shall not be more restrictive than requirements applied to other
development in the municipality under this chapter.
Sec. 4. 30 V.S.A. § 8010 is amended to read:
§ 8010. SELF-GENERATION AND NET METERING
* * *
(c) In accordance with this section, the Commission shall adopt and
implement rules that govern the installation and operation of net metering
systems.
(1) The rules shall establish and maintain a net metering program that:
* * *
(G) accounts for changes over time in the cost of technology; and
(H) allows a customer to retain ownership of the environmental
attributes of energy generated by the customer’s net metering system and of
any associated tradeable renewable energy credits or to transfer those
attributes and credits to the interconnecting retail provider, and:
(i) if the customer retains the attributes, reduces the value of the
credit provided under this section for electricity generated by the customer’s
net metering system by an appropriate amount; and

credit provided under this section for electricity generated by the customer’s
net metering system by an appropriate amount;
(ii) if the customer transfers the attributes to the interconnecting
provider, requires the provider to retain them for application toward
compliance with sections 8004 and 8005 of this title unless the provider has
fewer than 75,000 customers, in which case the attributes do not need to be
applied toward compliance obligations under sections 8004 and 8005 of this
title; and
(iii) if a retail electricity provider that is 100 percent renewable
under subdivision 8005(b)(1) of this title does not retire the transferred
attributes under sections 8004 and 8005 of this title, requires that the provider
apply an equivalent amount of attributes from distributed renewable
generation that qualifies under subdivision 8005(a)(2) of this title toward its

and
(ii) 40 feet for a facility with a plant capacity less than or equal to
150 kW but greater than 15 25 kW; and
(iii) 10 feet for a facility with a plant capacity less than or equal
to 25 kW.
(B) From each property boundary that is not a State or municipal
highway:
(i) 50 feet for a facility with a plant capacity exceeding 150 kW;
and
(ii) 25 feet for a facility with a plant capacity less than or equal to
150 kW but greater than 15 25 kW; and
(iii) 10 feet for a facility with a plant capacity less than or equal
to 25 kW.
(2) This subsection does not require a setback for a facility with a plant
capacity equal to or less than 15 kW. [Repealed.]
(3) On review of an application, the Commission may:

Sec. 4. 30 V.S.A. § 248(a)(7) is amended to read:
(7) When a certificate of public good under this section or amendment
to such a certificate is issued for an in-state electric generation or energy
storage facility with a capacity that is greater than 15 25 kilowatts, the
certificate holder within 45 days shall record a notice of the certificate or
amended certificate, on a form prescribed by the Commission, in the land
records of each municipality in which a facility subject to the certificate is
located and shall submit proof of this recording to the Commission. The
recording under this subsection shall be indexed as though the certificate
holder were the grantor of a deed. The prescribed form shall not exceed one
page and shall require identification of the land on which the facility is to be
located by reference to the conveyance to the current landowner, the number of
the certificate, and the name of each person to which the certificate was issued
and shall include information on how to contact the Commission to view the
certificate and supporting documents.
Sec. 5. PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION;

“plant” in 30 V.S.A. § 8002(18) and an overview of their process and
explanation of the recommendation to the House Committee on Energy and
Digital Infrastructure and the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and
Energy. In making its recommendation, the Commission shall consider:
