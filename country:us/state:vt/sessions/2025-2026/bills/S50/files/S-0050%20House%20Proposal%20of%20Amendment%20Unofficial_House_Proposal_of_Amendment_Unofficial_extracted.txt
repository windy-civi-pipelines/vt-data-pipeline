15 (H) allows a customer to retain ownership of the environmental
16 attributes of energy generated by the customer’s net metering system and of
17 any associated tradeable renewable energy credits or to transfer those attributes
18 and credits to the interconnecting retail provider, and:
19 (i) if the customer retains the attributes, reduces the value of the

1 (B) approve an agreement to a smaller setback among the applicant,
2 the municipal legislative body, and each owner of property adjoining the
3 smaller setback; or
4 (C) require a setback for a facility constructed on an area primarily
5 used for parking vehicles, if the application concerns such a facility.
6 (4) In this subsection:
7 (A) “kW” and “plant capacity” shall have the same meaning as in
8 section 8002 of this title.
9 (B) “Setback” means the shortest distance between the nearest

14 (7) When a certificate of public good under this section or amendment
15 to such a certificate is issued for an in-state electric generation or energy
16 storage facility with a capacity that is greater than 15 25 kilowatts, the
17 certificate holder within 45 days shall record a notice of the certificate or
18 amended certificate, on a form prescribed by the Commission, in the land
19 records of each municipality in which a facility subject to the certificate is

6 certificate and supporting documents.
7 Sec. 5. PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION;
8 DEFINITION OF SINGLE PLANT
9 On or before November 1, 2025, and with input from stakeholders, the
10 Public Utility Commission shall submit a recommended amended definition of
11 “plant” in 30 V.S.A. § 8002(18) and an overview of their process and
12 explanation of the recommendation to the House Committee on Energy and
13 Digital Infrastructure and the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and
14 Energy. In making its recommendation, the Commission shall consider:
15 (1) the land use benefits of collocation of energy generation facilities;
16 (2) the ability to ensure comprehensive review of collocated facilities;
17 and
18 (3) the potential impacts to ratepayers associated with collocated
19 facilities.
