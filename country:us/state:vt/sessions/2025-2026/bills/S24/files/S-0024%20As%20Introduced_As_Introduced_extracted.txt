11 also would allow municipalities that assume full legal responsibility for a
12 stormwater system to assess municipal impact fees on users of the stormwater
13 system. In addition, the bill extends from July 1, 2027 to July 1, 2036 the
14 assessment of the 0.22 percent clean water surcharge on the property transfer
15 tax. The bill also would establish the Local Community Implementation
