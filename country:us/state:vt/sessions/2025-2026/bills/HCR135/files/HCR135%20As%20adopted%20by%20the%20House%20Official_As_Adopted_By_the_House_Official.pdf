House concurrent resolution honoring esteemed Bennington Rural Firefighter Timothy Burgess
Whereas, Timothy Burgess has been a hard-working Bennington Rural Fire Department (BRFD) member
since 1976 and an exemplary fire prevention advocate and educator both locally and statewide, and
Whereas, his keen interest in firefighting was apparent from the moment he joined the department, as he
performed his duties diligently and enthusiastically, rising through the ranks from an entry-level firefighter to
lieutenant, to captain, and, ultimately, assistant chief, and
Whereas, Tim Burgess’s numerous departmental roles have included serving as the organization’s president,
and as a member of the truck committee, he repeatedly traveled out of state to review progress on the
construction of new fire trucks, and
Whereas, his involvement in the world of fire prevention has extended beyond his own department, as
president of the Bennington County Mutual Aid Association Inc. and through his active membership in the
New England Association of Fire Chiefs and the Vermont State Firefighters’ Association (VSFA), and
Whereas, as a lifetime member of VSFA, he served as a Bennington County representative, encouraged
young firefighters to enroll in Vermont Fire Academy training classes, judged fire truck and firefighting
competitions, arranged for annual meetings throughout the State, served as sergeant at arms for annual
meetings, and served on the scholarship committee that financially assists young individuals starting first-
responder careers, and one year, the VSFA yearbook was dedicated to him, in recognition of his outstanding
service, and
Whereas, Tim Burgess’s interest in educating future firefighters led to his involvement with the Southern
Vermont Regional Fire School, and he traveled to area schools for fire safety presentations, and, in appreciation
of these initiatives, Mt. Anthony Union Middle School recognized him as a Hometown Hero, and
Whereas, at the BRFD 2025 annual dinner, his colleagues will pay special tribute to Tim Burgess for his
exemplary service to the department and the Vermont firefighting and prevention community, now
therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly honors esteemed Bennington Rural Firefighter Timothy Burgess, and be it
further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to Tim Burgess.
