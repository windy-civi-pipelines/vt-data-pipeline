10 Sec. 1. FINDINGS
11 (a) The process of naming State buildings and facilities is inherently
12 influenced by the politics of the day.
13 (b) The General Assembly has sought to delegate its responsibility to name
14 State buildings and facilities to an administrative committee through the
15 creation of the State Building Naming Study Committee in 2024 Acts and
16 Resolves No. 162, Sec. 21, but that legislation has met resistance and the
17 implementation of the Committee has been administratively onerous.
18 (c) Recent requests to name State buildings within the Capitol Complex
19 have raised concerns about setting a precedent that could lead to further
20 constituent-driven proposals, creating a burdensome and contentious process.

1 (d) Historical inequities have prevented individuals from marginalized
2 communities from achieving the level of recognition typically required for
3 consideration in the naming process. To date, all State buildings named after
4 individuals have been named exclusively after White men.
5 (e) The General Assembly finds that the process of naming State buildings
6 and facilities is fraught with challenges, including political influence,
7 inequitable representation, and administrative burden. To address these
8 concerns, the General Assembly enacts this legislation prohibiting naming
9 State buildings or facilities after individuals.
10 Sec. 2. 29 V.S.A. § 820 is amended to read:
11 § 820. THE NAMING OF STATE BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES
12 (a) Except for State transportation buildings and facilities named by the
13 Transportation Board in accordance with 19 V.S.A. § 5, the name by which a
14 State building or facility is to be known shall be authorized by the General
15 Assembly.
16 (b) The General Assembly shall not authorize any request to name a State
17 building or facility after an individual that has not been formally approved by
18 the General Assembly on or before July 1, 2025.
19 Sec. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE
20 This act shall take effect on passage.
