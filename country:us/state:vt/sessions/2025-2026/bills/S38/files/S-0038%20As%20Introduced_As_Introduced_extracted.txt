4 Date:
5 Subject: Conservation and development; wildlife conservation; habitat
6 corridors; wildlife crossings
7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to require the
8 Secretary of Natural Resources to establish a program to fund the creation and
9 maintenance of habitat corridors and wildlife crossings in the State.
10 An act relating to conserving habitat corridors and wildlife crossings
11 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
12 Sec. 1. SHORT TITLE
13 This act may be cited as the “Habitat Corridor Conservation Stamp Act.”
14 Sec. 2. FINDINGS
15 The General Assembly finds that:
16 (1) Nature faces a catastrophic loss of biodiversity, both locally and
17 globally.
18 (2) In addition to the value it has for its own sake, biodiversity is
19 essential to human survival.
VT LEG #378831 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.38
2025 Page 2 of 14
1 (3) The 2017 Vermont Forest Action Plan found that fragmentation and
2 parcelization represent major threats to forest health and productivity and
3 exacerbate the impacts of climate change.
4 (4) The 2021 Vermont Climate Assessment highlights an increase in
5 extreme weather events such as droughts and floods as a significant impact of
6 climate change in Vermont and recommends nature-based solutions as a
7 proven, low-cost strategy for climate adaptation and resilience.
8 (5) The initial Vermont Climate Action Plan calls for investing in
9 strategic conservation to increase the pace of permanent conservation towards
10 30 by 30 targets, with Vermont Conservation Design guiding prioritization of
11 efforts.
12 (6) The Nature Conservancy has developed the Resilient and Connected
13 Landscapes project and found that Vermont plays a key role in the
14 conservation of biodiversity regionally.
15 (7) The Staying Connected Initiative is an international partnership of
16 public and private organizations. Its goal is to maintain, enhance, and restore
17 landscape connectivity for wide-ranging mammals across the Northern
18 Appalachians-Acadian region, from the Adirondack Mountains to the Maritime
19 Provinces. The Staying Connected Initiative has identified nine linkages
20 across this vast region that are extremely important to wildlife. Six of these
21 linkages lie within Vermont.
VT LEG #378831 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.38
2025 Page 3 of 14
1 (8) Vermont’s most effective and efficient contribution to conserving
2 biological diversity and maintaining a landscape resilient to climate change is,
3 first, to conserve an intact and connected landscape and, second, to create and
4 protect connections in the landscape.
5 (9) Given the threats of biodiversity loss, landscape fragmentation, and
6 climate change, the General Assembly should conserve lands in the State to
7 increase landscape connectivity.
8 Sec. 3. 10 V.S.A. chapter 104 is added to read:
9 CHAPTER 104. HABITAT CORRIDOR CONSERVATION
10 § 4201. DEFINITIONS
