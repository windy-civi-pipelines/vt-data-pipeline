1 Natural Resources and Energy a proposed a regional long-term septage,
2 sludge, and solids management plan for the safe and cost-effective disposition
3 of septage, sludge, and biosolids in a manner that eliminates or reduced
4 environmental and public health risks. The plan shall:
5 (1) propose how to establish multimunicipality member districts or
6 utilities for the regional management of septage, sludge, or biosolids;
7 (2) identify, assess, and designate existing wastewater treatment
8 facilities in the State for the purpose of serving as a regional acceptance site for
9 septage, sludge, and biosolids, while preserving the ability of each facility to
10 serve the municipality in which it is located;
11 (3) identify administrative burdens, cost, capacity, or other barriers that
12 may limit the ability to operate a regional acceptance site and proposed
13 methods to address each identified barrier;
14 (4) propose how to preserve the ability of wastewater treatment facilities
15 to support wastewater projects by villages or municipalities without a facility
16 through continued acceptance of septage;
17 (5) how to facilitate intermunicipal agreements for the operation and use
18 of regional acceptance sites, including how costs to operate, maintain, upgrade,
19 or construct a regional facility can be shared across participating towns;

1 (6) assess and support options for the management of the outputs of
2 regional acceptance sites in order to ensure beneficial or value-added end use,
3 including whether:
4 (A) entering public-private partnerships for certain wastes or outputs
5 would benefit the operation of regional acceptance sites; and
6 (B) outputs could be utilized for resource recovery;
7 (7) propose how regional acceptance facilities would manage the
8 acceptance and disposition of septage, sludge, or biosolids containing
9 contaminants of concern, such as PFAS; and
10 (8) propose regional acceptance sites could charge for services,
11 including potential rate formulas, taxes, fees, or incentives.
12 (c) Prior to submitting the plan to the General Assembly under subsection
13 (b) of this section, the Secretary shall provide public notice of the proposed
14 plan and shall take public comment for a period of not less than 30 days.
