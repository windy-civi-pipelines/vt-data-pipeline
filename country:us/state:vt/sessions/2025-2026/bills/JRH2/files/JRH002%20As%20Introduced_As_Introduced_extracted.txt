Joint resolution urging President Trump to refrain from imposing tariffs on
goods and services imported from Canada
Whereas, the United States and Canada have been military and diplomatic
allies and economic partners, even through episodes of commercial
disagreement, since Canadian confederation in 1867, and most especially from
World War II forward, and
Whereas, according to TD Bank, during the first three quarters of 2024,
approximately $683 billion in combined goods and services was shipped in
both directions across the United States-Canada border, and
Whereas, the same report also noted that Canada is the United States’
number one export market, and
Whereas, significant elements of this trade are integrated, especially in the
automobile manufacturing sector, and
Whereas, even closer to home, the personal and commercial ties between
Vermont and Canada are among the closest of any American state to its
northern neighbor, and
Whereas, the personal aspect of this relationship is reflected in the State of
Vermont offering its residents enhanced IDs for driver and nondriver
identification, in order to facilitate easier cross-border travel, and
Whereas, for 2023, the Canadian Consulate in Boston reported that Vermont
exported $680 million in goods and $165 million in services to Canada, and
Whereas, in 2023, Vermont imported $2.6 billion in goods from Canada and
Canadian investments in the State supported over 17,000 Vermont jobs, and
Whereas, according to the Department of Public Service, in 2023, 24
percent of Vermont’s electric supply portfolio was served by Hydro-Québec,
aside from any renewable energy credits, and Vermont Gas Systems receives
100 percent of its gas from Canada, and
Whereas, in recent years, Governor Philip Scott has repeatedly traveled to
Montreal on trade missions and has strived to enhance Vermont-Quebec trade
ties, and
Whereas, on Monday February 3, 2025, the United States came within
hours of imposing a 25 percent tariff on most Canadian products entering our
country and a corresponding 10 percent tariff on energy products and
services, and
Whereas, the Government of Canada was prepared to respond in kind had
the United States proceeded with its announced intentions to implement these
tariffs, and
Whereas, shortly before the deadline, the United States announced a 30-day
delay before any tariffs with Canada might be imposed, leaving a sense of
immediate relief but a period of worrisome uncertainty, and
Whereas, the United States imports more steel and aluminum from Canada
than from any other nation, and the 25 percent universally applicable tariff on
these products, which the United States announced on February 10, 2025, will
significantly impact both nations’ economies, and
Whereas, the separate issue of a possible 25 percent tariff on most Canadian
goods entering the United States and an associated 10 percent tariff on imports
of Canadian energy products, along with the economic and daily living
implications for Vermont and Vermonters, remains on the table, and
Whereas, Governor Philip Scott has established an interagency task force to
prepare for the still real potential that these proposed tariffs, aside from those
already imposed on steel and aluminum, will take effect, and
Whereas, although the Governor’s foresight to develop a contingency plan
for the worst-case scenario is prudent and appropriate, the ideal situation
would be for the task force’s contingencies to prove unnecessary, as the
dueling tariffs could result in a disruption in long-established industrial and
other commercial relationships and agreements, and the two nation’s tariffs
could prove costly for consumers on both sides of our shared international
boundary, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly urges President Donald J. Trump to refrain
from imposing tariffs on goods and services imported into the United States
from Canada, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this
resolution to President Donald J. Trump, Governor Philip B. Scott, Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, Premier François Legault, and the Vermont
Congressional Delegation.
