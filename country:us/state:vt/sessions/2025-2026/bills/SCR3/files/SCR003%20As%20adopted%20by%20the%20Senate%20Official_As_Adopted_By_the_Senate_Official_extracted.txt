six years, serving as a Girl Scout Ambassador, and participating in the Girls Rock the Capitol
program at the State House, and
Whereas, community and school service are important for Liliane Gordon as her Green Up
Day, food support, animal care activities, and four-year student council membership attest, and
Whereas, in recognition of her high school scholastic and athletic accomplishments, at the
2024 graduation ceremony, CVU presented Liliane Gordon with an academic athletic award,
now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
