3 Referred to Committee on
4 Date:
5 Subject: Health; health information; data privacy
6 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to regulate the
7 collection, sharing, and selling of consumer health data in Vermont.
8 An act relating to the collection, sharing, and selling of consumer health
9 data
10 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
11 Sec. 1. 18 V.S.A. chapter 42B is amended to read:
12 42B. HEALTH CARE PRIVACY
13 Subchapter 1. Disclosure of Protected Health Information
14 § 1881. DISCLOSURE OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION
15 PROHIBITED
16 * * *
17 Subchapter 2. Vermont My Health My Data Act
18 § 1891a. SHORT TITLE
19 This subchapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Vermont My
20 Health My Data Act.”
VT LEG #379087 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.74

1 § 1891b. FINDINGS AND INTENT
2 (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds that:
3 (1) The residents of Vermont regard their privacy as a fundamental right
4 and an essential element of their individual freedom. Fundamental privacy
5 rights have long been and continue to be integral to protecting Vermonters and
6 to safeguarding our democratic republic.
7 (2) Information related to an individual’s health conditions or attempts
8 to obtain health care services is among the most personal and sensitive
9 categories of data collected. Vermonters expect that their health data is
10 protected under laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
11 Act of 1996 (HIPAA). However, HIPAA only covers health data collected by
12 specific health care entities, including most health care providers. Health data
13 collected by noncovered entities, including certain applications and websites,
14 are not afforded the same protections. This act works to close the gap between
15 consumer knowledge and industry practice by providing stronger privacy
16 protections for all of Vermont consumers’ health data.
17 (b) Intent. By enacting this subchapter, it is the intent of the General
18 Assembly to provide heightened protections for Vermonters’ health data by:
19 (1) requiring additional disclosures and consumer consent regarding the
20 collection, sharing, and use of their health data;
VT LEG #379087 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.74
2025 Page 3 of 30
1 (2) empowering consumers with the right to have their health data
2 deleted;
3 (3) prohibiting the selling of consumer health data without valid
4 authorization signed by the consumer; and
5 (4) making it unlawful to utilize a geofence around a facility that
6 provides health care services.
7 § 1891c. DEFINITIONS
8 As used in this subchapter:
9 (1) “Abortion” means any medical treatment intended to induce the
10 termination of, or to terminate, a clinically diagnosable pregnancy except for
11 the purpose of producing a live birth.
12 (2) “Affiliate” means a legal entity that shares common branding with
13 another legal entity and controls, is controlled by, or is under common control

17 outstanding shares of any class of voting security of a company;

16 (b) Withdrawal of consent. A consumer has the right to withdraw consent
17 from a regulated entity’s or small business’s collection and sharing of
18 consumer health data regarding the consumer.
19 (c) Right to delete. A consumer has the right to have consumer health data

21 regulated entity or small business of the consumer’s request for deletion.
VT LEG #379087 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.74
2025 Page 19 of 30
1 (1) A regulated entity or small business that receives a consumer’s
2 request to delete any consumer health data regarding the consumer shall:
3 (A) delete the consumer health data from its records, including from
4 all parts of the regulated entity’s or small business’s network, including
5 archived or backup systems pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection (c);
6 and
7 (B) notify all affiliates, processors, contractors, and other third parties
8 with whom the regulated entity or the small business has shared consumer
9 health data of the deletion request.
10 (2) All affiliates, processors, contractors, and other third parties that

15 stored on archived or backup systems, then the request for deletion may be
16 delayed to enable restoration of the archived or backup systems, provided that

18 deletion request.
19 (d) Request requirements.
20 (1) A consumer may exercise the rights set forth in this chapter by
21 submitting a request to a regulated entity or small business at any time. The
VT LEG #379087 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.74
2025 Page 20 of 30
1 request may be made by a secure and reliable means established by the
2 regulated entity or small business and described in its consumer health data
3 privacy policy. The method shall take into account the ways in which
4 consumers normally interact with the regulated entity or small business, the
5 need for secure and reliable communication of such requests, and the ability of
6 the regulated entity or the small business to authenticate the identity of the
7 consumer making the request. A regulated entity or small business shall not
8 require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise consumer
9 rights pursuant to this subchapter but may require a consumer to use an
10 existing account.
11 (2) If a regulated entity or small business is unable to authenticate the
12 request using commercially reasonable efforts, the regulated entity or small
13 business is not required to comply with a request to initiate an action under this
14 section and may request that the consumer provide additional information
15 reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the consumer’s request.
16 (3) Information provided in response to a consumer request shall be
17 provided by a regulated entity or small business free of charge, up to twice
18 annually per consumer. If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded,
19 excessive, or repetitive, the regulated entity or small business may charge the
20 consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with
21 the request or decline to act on the request. The regulated entity or small
VT LEG #379087 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.74
2025 Page 21 of 30
1 business bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded,
2 excessive, or repetitive nature of the request.
3 (4) A regulated entity or small business shall comply with a consumer’s
4 requests under subsections (a) through (c) of this section without undue delay,
5 but in all cases within 45 days following receipt of the request submitted
6 pursuant to the methods described in this section. A regulated entity or small
7 business shall promptly take steps to authenticate a consumer request;
8 provided, however, that completion of these steps does not extend the
9 regulated entity’s or small business’s duty to comply with the consumer’s
10 request within 45 days following receipt of the consumer’s request. The
11 response period may be extended once by 45 additional days when reasonably
12 necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the consumer’s
13 requests, provided the regulated entity or small business informs the consumer
14 of any such extension within the initial 45-day response period, together with
15 the reason for the extension.
16 (e) Consumer appeal. A regulated entity or small business shall establish a
17 process for a consumer to appeal the regulated entity’s or small business’s
18 refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after the
19 consumer’s receipt of the decision. The appeal process shall be conspicuously
20 available and similar to the process for submitting requests to initiate action
21 pursuant to this section. Within 45 days following receipt of an appeal, a
VT LEG #379087 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.74
2025 Page 22 of 30

9 (1) restrict access to consumer health data by the regulated entity’s or
10 small business’s employees, processors, and contractors to only those
11 employees, processors, and contractors for whom access is necessary to further
12 the purposes for which the consumer provided consent or where necessary to
13 provide a product or service that the consumer to whom such consumer health
14 data relates has requested from the regulated entity or small business; and
15 (2) establish, implement, and maintain administrative, technical, and
16 physical data security practices that, at a minimum, satisfy reasonable
17 standards of care within the regulated entity’s or small business’s industry to
18 protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of consumer health data
19 appropriate to the volume and nature of the consumer health data at issue.

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.74
2025 Page 1 of 30
1 S.74
2 Introduced by Senators Lyons, Gulick and Harrison
3 Referred to Committee on
4 Date:
5 Subject: Health; health information; data privacy
6 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to regulate the
7 collection, sharing, and selling of consumer health data in Vermont.
8 An act relating to the collection, sharing, and selling of consumer health
9 data
10 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
11 Sec. 1. 18 V.S.A. chapter 42B is amended to read:
12 42B. HEALTH CARE PRIVACY
13 Subchapter 1. Disclosure of Protected Health Information
14 § 1881. DISCLOSURE OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION
15 PROHIBITED
16 * * *
17 Subchapter 2. Vermont My Health My Data Act
18 § 1891a. SHORT TITLE
19 This subchapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Vermont My
20 Health My Data Act.”
VT LEG #379087 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.74
2025 Page 2 of 30
1 § 1891b. FINDINGS AND INTENT
2 (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds that:
3 (1) The residents of Vermont regard their privacy as a fundamental right
4 and an essential element of their individual freedom. Fundamental privacy
5 rights have long been and continue to be integral to protecting Vermonters and
6 to safeguarding our democratic republic.
7 (2) Information related to an individual’s health conditions or attempts
8 to obtain health care services is among the most personal and sensitive
9 categories of data collected. Vermonters expect that their health data is
10 protected under laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
11 Act of 1996 (HIPAA). However, HIPAA only covers health data collected by
12 specific health care entities, including most health care providers. Health data
13 collected by noncovered entities, including certain applications and websites,
14 are not afforded the same protections. This act works to close the gap between
15 consumer knowledge and industry practice by providing stronger privacy
16 protections for all of Vermont consumers’ health data.
17 (b) Intent. By enacting this subchapter, it is the intent of the General
18 Assembly to provide heightened protections for Vermonters’ health data by:
19 (1) requiring additional disclosures and consumer consent regarding the
20 collection, sharing, and use of their health data;
VT LEG #379087 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.74
2025 Page 3 of 30
1 (2) empowering consumers with the right to have their health data
2 deleted;
3 (3) prohibiting the selling of consumer health data without valid
4 authorization signed by the consumer; and
5 (4) making it unlawful to utilize a geofence around a facility that
6 provides health care services.
7 § 1891c. DEFINITIONS

15 online mechanism that the consumer may use to contact these third parties.
16 (b) Withdrawal of consent. A consumer has the right to withdraw consent
17 from a regulated entity’s or small business’s collection and sharing of

19 (c) Right to delete. A consumer has the right to have consumer health data

VT LEG #379087 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.74
2025 Page 19 of 30
1 (1) A regulated entity or small business that receives a consumer’s
2 request to delete any consumer health data regarding the consumer shall:
3 (A) delete the consumer health data from its records, including from

6 and
7 (B) notify all affiliates, processors, contractors, and other third parties
8 with whom the regulated entity or the small business has shared consumer

18 deletion request.
19 (d) Request requirements.
20 (1) A consumer may exercise the rights set forth in this chapter by
21 submitting a request to a regulated entity or small business at any time. The
VT LEG #379087 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.74
2025 Page 20 of 30
1 request may be made by a secure and reliable means established by the
2 regulated entity or small business and described in its consumer health data
3 privacy policy. The method shall take into account the ways in which
4 consumers normally interact with the regulated entity or small business, the
5 need for secure and reliable communication of such requests, and the ability of
6 the regulated entity or the small business to authenticate the identity of the
7 consumer making the request. A regulated entity or small business shall not
8 require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise consumer
9 rights pursuant to this subchapter but may require a consumer to use an
10 existing account.
11 (2) If a regulated entity or small business is unable to authenticate the
12 request using commercially reasonable efforts, the regulated entity or small
13 business is not required to comply with a request to initiate an action under this
14 section and may request that the consumer provide additional information
15 reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the consumer’s request.
16 (3) Information provided in response to a consumer request shall be
17 provided by a regulated entity or small business free of charge, up to twice
18 annually per consumer. If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded,
19 excessive, or repetitive, the regulated entity or small business may charge the
20 consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with
21 the request or decline to act on the request. The regulated entity or small
VT LEG #379087 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.74
2025 Page 21 of 30
1 business bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded,
2 excessive, or repetitive nature of the request.
3 (4) A regulated entity or small business shall comply with a consumer’s
4 requests under subsections (a) through (c) of this section without undue delay,
5 but in all cases within 45 days following receipt of the request submitted
6 pursuant to the methods described in this section. A regulated entity or small
7 business shall promptly take steps to authenticate a consumer request;
8 provided, however, that completion of these steps does not extend the
9 regulated entity’s or small business’s duty to comply with the consumer’s
10 request within 45 days following receipt of the consumer’s request. The
11 response period may be extended once by 45 additional days when reasonably
12 necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the consumer’s
13 requests, provided the regulated entity or small business informs the consumer
14 of any such extension within the initial 45-day response period, together with
15 the reason for the extension.
16 (e) Consumer appeal. A regulated entity or small business shall establish a
17 process for a consumer to appeal the regulated entity’s or small business’s
18 refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after the
19 consumer’s receipt of the decision. The appeal process shall be conspicuously
20 available and similar to the process for submitting requests to initiate action
21 pursuant to this section. Within 45 days following receipt of an appeal, a
VT LEG #379087 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.74
2025 Page 22 of 30
1 regulated entity or small business shall inform the consumer in writing of any
2 action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written
3 explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If the appeal is denied, the
4 regulated entity or small business shall also provide the consumer with an
5 online mechanism, if available, or other method through which the consumer
6 may contact the Office of the Attorney General to submit a complaint.
7 § 1891g. PROTECTION OF CONSUMER HEALTH DATA
8 A regulated entity or small business shall:
9 (1) restrict access to consumer health data by the regulated entity’s or
10 small business’s employees, processors, and contractors to only those
11 employees, processors, and contractors for whom access is necessary to further
12 the purposes for which the consumer provided consent or where necessary to
13 provide a product or service that the consumer to whom such consumer health
14 data relates has requested from the regulated entity or small business; and
15 (2) establish, implement, and maintain administrative, technical, and
16 physical data security practices that, at a minimum, satisfy reasonable
17 standards of care within the regulated entity’s or small business’s industry to
18 protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of consumer health data
19 appropriate to the volume and nature of the consumer health data at issue.

1 § 1891h. PROCESSORS OF CONSUMER HEALTH DATA
2 (a) Contract required.
3 (1) A processor may process consumer health data only pursuant to a
4 binding contract between the processor and the regulated entity or small
5 business that sets forth the processing instructions and limits the actions the
6 processor may take with respect to the consumer health data it processes on
7 behalf of the regulated entity or small business.
8 (2) A processor may process consumer health data only in a manner that
9 is consistent with the binding instructions set forth in the contract with the
10 regulated entity or small business.
11 (b) Obligation to assist. To the extent possible, a processor shall use
12 appropriate technical and organizational measures to assist the regulated entity
13 or small business in fulfilling the regulated entity’s and the small business’s
14 obligations under this chapter.
15 (c) Failure to adhere. If a processor fails to adhere to the regulated entity’s
16 or small business’s instructions or processes consumer health data in a manner
17 that is outside the scope of the processor’s contract with the regulated entity or
18 small business, the processor is considered a regulated entity or small business
19 with respect to the data and is subject to all the requirements of this chapter
20 with regard to the data.
