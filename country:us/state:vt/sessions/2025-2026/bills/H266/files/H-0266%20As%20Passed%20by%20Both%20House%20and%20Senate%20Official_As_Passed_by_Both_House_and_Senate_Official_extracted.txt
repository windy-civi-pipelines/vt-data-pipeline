(b)(1) The purpose of this section is to reduce health care costs. A hospital
shall not charge or collect from the patient or health insurer any amount for a

the amounts set forth in subsection (a) of this section or increase the amounts
the hospital charges for other prescription drugs, procedures, tests, imaging,

a result of implementing this section.
(2) If a hospital demonstrates to the Green Mountain Care Board in its
budget submissions pursuant to subchapter 7 of this chapter that the price cap
set forth in subsection (a) of this section is having a negative impact on access
to care, the quality of care, or the sustainability of rural health care services,
or a combination of these, the hospital may propose to increase the
commercial reimbursement rates for one or more of its service lines, such as
primary care, and the Board shall consider both the demonstrated impact and
the proposed increase to reimbursement rates.
(c) This section shall not apply to an independent hospital that is
