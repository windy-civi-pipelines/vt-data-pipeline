4 § 8004. SALES OF ELECTRIC ENERGY; RENEWABLE CLEAN
5 ENERGY STANDARD (RES CES)
6 (a) Establishment Expansion; requirements. The RES Renewable Energy
7 Standard is established expanded to become the CES. Under this program, a
8 retail electricity provider shall not sell or otherwise provide or offer to sell or
9 provide electricity in the State of Vermont without ownership of sufficient
10 energy produced by clean and renewable energy plants or sufficient tradeable
11 renewable energy and zero emissions credits from plants whose energy is
12 capable of delivery in New England that reflect the required amounts of clean
13 and renewable energy set forth in section 8005 of this title or without support
14 of energy transformation projects in accordance with that section. A retail
15 electricity provider may meet the required amounts of clean and renewable
16 energy through eligible tradeable renewable energy and zero emissions credits
17 that it owns and retires, eligible clean and renewable energy resources with
18 environmental attributes still attached, or a combination of those credits and
19 resources.
VT LEG #378873 v.5

1 (b) Rules. The Commission shall adopt update the rules that are necessary
2 to allow the Commission and the Department to implement and supervise
3 further the implementation and maintenance of the RES CES.
4 (c) RECS RECs and ZECs; banking. The Commission shall allow a
5 provider that has met the required amount amounts of renewable energy or
6 zero emissions credits in a given year, commencing with 2017, to retain
7 tradeable renewable energy or zero emissions credits created or purchased in
8 excess of that amount for application to the provider’s required amount of
9 clean or renewable energy in one of the following three years.
10 (d) Alternative compliance payment. In lieu of purchasing renewable
11 energy or tradeable renewable energy or zero emissions credits or supporting
12 energy transformation projects to satisfy the requirements of this section and
13 section 8005 of this title, a retail electricity provider in this State may pay to
14 the Vermont Clean Energy Development Fund established under section 8015
15 of this title an alternative compliance payment at the applicable rate set forth in
16 section 8005. The administrator of the Vermont Clean Energy Development
17 Fund shall use the payment from a retail electricity provider electing to make
18 an alternative compliance payment to satisfy its obligations under subdivisions
19 8005(a)(1), 8005(a)(2), 8005(a)(4), and 8005(a)(5) of this title for the
20 development of renewable energy plants that are intended to serve and benefit
21 customers with low income of the retail electricity provider that has made the
VT LEG #378873 v.5

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.110
2025 Page 25 of 36
1 payment. Such plants shall be located within the provider’s service territory, if
2 feasible. In the event that such a payment is insufficient to enable the
3 development of a renewable energy plant, the administrator may use the
4 payment for other initiatives allowed under section 8015 of this title that will
5 benefit customers with low income of the retail electricity provider that has
6 made the payment. As used in this subsection (d), “customer with low
7 income” means a person purchasing energy from a retail electricity provider
8 and with an income that is less than or equal to 80 percent of area median
9 income, adjusted for family size, as published annually by the U.S. Department
10 of Housing and Urban Development.

12 (f) Joint efforts. Retail electricity providers may engage in joint efforts to
13 meet one or more categories within the RES CES.
14 Sec. 11. 30 V.S.A. § 8005 is amended to read:
15 § 8005. RES CES CATEGORIES
16 (a) Categories. This section specifies five categories of required resources
17 to meet the requirements of the RES CES established in section 8004 of this
18 title: total clean and renewable energy, distributed renewable generation,
19 energy transformation, new renewable energy, and load growth renewable
20 energy. In order to support progress toward Vermont’s climate goals and
VT LEG #378873 v.5

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.110
2025 Page 26 of 36
1 requirements, a provider may, but shall not be required to, exceed the
2 statutorily required amounts under this section.
3 (1) Total clean and renewable energy.
4 (A) Purpose; establishment. To encourage the economic and
5 environmental benefits of renewable energy, this subdivision establishes, for
6 the RES CES, minimum total amounts of clean and renewable energy within
7 the supply portfolio of each retail electricity provider. To satisfy this
8 requirement, a provider may use clean energy generated within New England
9 or renewable energy with environmental attributes attached or any class of
10 tradeable renewable energy credits generated by any renewable energy plant
11 whose energy is capable of delivery in New England.
12 (B) Required amounts.
13 (i) The amounts of total clean and renewable energy required by
14 this subsection (a) shall be 63 percent of each retail electricity provider’s
15 annual load during the year beginning on January 1, 2025, increasing by at
16 least an additional four 7.4 percent each third January 1 thereafter until
17 reaching 100 percent: on and after January 1, 2030.
18 (i) on and after January 1, 2035 for a retail electricity provider who
19 serves a single customer that takes service at 115 kilovolts and each municipal
20 retail electricity provider formed under local charter or chapter 79 of this title;
21 and
VT LEG #378873 v.5

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.110
2025 Page 27 of 36
1 (ii) on and after January 1, 2030, for all other retail electricity
2 providers The amount of total renewable energy required by this subsection (a)
3 shall be 55 percent of each retail electricity provider’s annual electricity
4 purchases during the year beginning on January 1, 2027, increasing by an
5 additional four percent each January 1 hereafter, until reaching 75 percent on
6 and after January 1, 2032.
7 * * *
8 (2) Distributed renewable generation.
9 (A) Purpose; establishment. This subdivision establishes a
10 distributed renewable generation category for the RES CES. This category
11 encourages the use of distributed generation to support the reliability of the
12 State’s electric system; reduce line losses; contribute to avoiding or deferring
13 improvements to that system necessitated by transmission or distribution
14 constraints; and diversify the size and type of resources connected to that
15 system. This category requires the use of renewable energy for these purposes
16 to reduce environmental and health impacts from air emissions that would
17 result from using other forms of generation.
18 * * *
19 (E) Avoiding transmission and distribution constraints.
20 (i) Procurements by retail electricity providers and programs that
21 support meeting the requirements of this subdivision (2) shall avoid
VT LEG #378873 v.5

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.110
2025 Page 28 of 36
1 development of new facilities in generation constrained areas of the
2 distribution or transmission system that would not need to be expanded but for
3 the addition of additional generation, unless costs associated with development
4 in those generation constrained areas are not passed through to ratepayers
5 through the cost to utilities to purchase the generation or in any other manner.
6 To implement the intent of this section, the Commission may update or adopt
7 rules, including rules that require a locational adjustor fee.
8 (ii) A retail electricity provider may petition the Commission for relief
9 of the requirements of subdivision (C) of this subdivision (a)(2) or the
10 associated alternative compliance payment, which may be granted if the
11 provider can demonstrate that it is unable to meet its requirements without
12 extensive upgrades to the transmission or distribution infrastructure that would
13 be borne by the provider’s ratepayers. If relief is granted, the retail electricity
14 provider shall be required to instead acquire new renewable generation from
15 facilities that qualify to meet the requirements of subdivision (4) of this
16 subsection (a), in addition to the requirements as described in subdivision (4)
17 of this subsection (a).
18 (3) Energy transformation.
19 (A) Purpose; establishment. This subdivision (3) establishes an
20 energy transformation category for the RES CES. This category encourages
21 Vermont retail electricity providers to support additional distributed renewable
VT LEG #378873 v.5

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.110
2025 Page 29 of 36
1 generation or to support other projects to reduce fossil fuel consumed by their
2 customers and the emission of greenhouse gases attributable to that
3 consumption. A retail electricity provider may satisfy the energy
4 transformation requirement through distributed renewable generation in
5 addition to the generation used to satisfy subdivision (2) of this subsection (a)
6 or energy transformation projects or a combination of such generation and
7 projects.
8 * * *
9 (4) New renewable energy.
10 (A) Purpose; establishment. This subdivision (4) establishes a new
11 regional renewable energy category for the RES CES. This category
12 encourages the use of new renewable generation to support the reliability of
13 the regional ISO-NE electric system. To satisfy this requirement, a provider
14 shall use new renewable energy with environmental attributes attached or any
15 class of tradeable renewable energy credits generated by any renewable energy
16 plant coming into service after January 1, 2010 whose energy is capable of
17 delivery in New England.
18 * * *
19 (6) Alternative compliance rates.
20 (A) The alternative compliance payment rates for the categories
21 established by subdivisions (1)–(3) of this subsection (a) shall be:
VT LEG #378873 v.5

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.110
2025 Page 30 of 36
1 (i) total clean and renewable energy requirement — $0.01 per
2 kWh; and
3 (ii) distributed renewable generation and energy transformation
4 requirements — $0.06 per kWh.
5 (B) The Commission shall adjust these rates for inflation annually
6 commencing January 1, 2018, using the CPI.
7 (C) For the distributed renewable energy, new renewable energy and
8 load growth requirements, it shall be $0.04 per kWh annually commencing on
9 January 1, 2025, with calculations for inflation beginning on January 1, 2023.
10 * * *
11 Sec. 12. 30 V.S.A. § 8006 is amended to read:
12 § 8006. TRADEABLE CREDITS; ENVIRONMENTAL ATTRIBUTES;
13 RECOGNITION, MONITORING, AND DISCLOSURE
14 (a) The Commission shall establish or adopt a amend and expand its system
15 of tradeable renewable energy credits for renewable resources that may be
16 earned by electric generation qualifying for the prior RES to include clean
17 energy generation. The system shall recognize tradeable renewable energy
18 credits monitored and traded on the New England Generation Information
19 System (GIS); shall provide a process for the recognition, approval, and
20 monitoring of environmental attributes attached to clean and renewable energy
21 that are eligible to satisfy the requirements of sections 8004 and 8005 of this
VT LEG #378873 v.5

1 title but are not monitored and traded on the GIS; and shall otherwise be
2 consistent with regional practices.
3 (b) The Commission shall ensure that all electricity provider and provider-
4 affiliate disclosures and representations made with regard to a provider’s
5 portfolio are accurate and reasonably supported by objective data. Further, the
6 Commission shall ensure that providers disclose the types of generation used
7 and shall clearly distinguish between energy or tradeable energy credits
8 provided from clean, renewable, and nonrenewable energy sources and
9 existing and new renewable energy.
10 Sec. 13. 30 V.S.A. § 8008 is amended to read:
11 § 8008. AGREEMENTS; ATTRIBUTE REVENUES; DISPOSITION BY
12 COMMISSION
13 (a) As used in this section, “the revenues” means revenues that are from the
14 sale, through tradeable clean or renewable energy certificates or other means,
15 of environmental attributes associated with the generation of clean and
16 renewable energy from a system of generation resources with a total plant
17 capacity greater than 200 MW and that are received by a Vermont retail
18 electricity provider on or after May 1, 2012, pursuant to an agreement,
19 contract, memorandum of understanding, or other transaction in which a
20 person or entity agrees to transfer such revenues or rights associated with such
21 attributes to the provider.
