Whereas, many Vermont high schools now boast varsity snowboarding teams, and, in
2025, the Jay Peak Resort hosted the girls’ and boys’ combined State championship
meet, and
Whereas, the North Country Falcons, snowboarding on familiar trails, delighted their
hometown supporters, and
Whereas, the Falcon girls’ performances were superb, and especially memorable was a
team member who won the overall individual State girls’ title, and a North Country
colleague trailed closely with a third-place finish, and
Whereas, although not the team champions, the Falcon girls, consisting of Aine
Remmers, Dakotah Bowen, Willow Clements, Aubrey Sicotte, Haven Brunell, Eliah
Dillion, and Sophie Corkins, scored a strong second-place overall score, and
Whereas, the Falcon boys won both the giant slalom, in which quickness and
steadiness on the slope are essential elements, and the rail jam, a competition profiling a
snowboarder’s ability to perform tricks on a rail or rails while being assessed for style,
technique, and creativity, and
Whereas, after tallying all the boys’ scores, North Country was on top, surpassing
second-place Burr and Burton Academy, and the Falcon team, composed of Carson
Limlaw, Logan Ellis, Quinn Goff, Armond Capron, Carson LaCroix, Emmett Williams,
Chase Currie, and Gregory Rondeau, proudly brought home their school’s first
snowboarding title, and
Whereas, Head Coach Robert Walls-Thumma, who returned to North Country this
year after coaching elsewhere, and Assistant Coach Beth Koennincke were proud of all
the North Country snowboarders’ achievements, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2025 North Country Union High School
Falcons’ exemplary snowboarding teams, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
North Country High School.
