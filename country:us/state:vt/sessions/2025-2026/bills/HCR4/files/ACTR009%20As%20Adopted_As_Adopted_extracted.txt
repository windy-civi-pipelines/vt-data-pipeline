Senior High School Division IV championship girls’ soccer team.
(H.C.R.4)
Offered by Representatives Hango of Berkshire, Laroche of Franklin, Demar of
Enosburgh, Gregoire of Fairfield, and Walker of Swanton
Offered by Senators Brock and Norris
Whereas, the 11th-seeded varsity athletic team in an annual interscholastic playoff
series seldom anticipates a championship game berth, but in the 2024 Division IV girls’
soccer competition, that was the surprising result for the Richford Rockets, who
demonstrated their true talent when they faced the top-ranked and undefeated West
Rutland Golden Horde in an exciting season finale at Rutland High School’s field, and
Whereas, thrilled to have astounded their supporters, the Rockets aimed to prove their
journey to this special game would be happily memorable, and
Whereas, despite trailing 2–0 at the mid-game break, the Rockets played superbly
during the second half; first, scoring less than two minutes after play resumed; then, at
the midpoint of the concluding half; and finally, with 13:57 remaining of regulation time,
all the while as the Richford defense prevented West Rutland from increasing its side of
the score, and
Whereas, the Rockets, who triumphantly returned home with Richford’s first-ever
girls’ soccer title, were Vanessa Tessier, Teddy Roberts, Keeley Long, Mikayla Chagnon,
Adi Chagnon, Kyrielle Deuso, Audrey Swanson, Jazmine Cunningham, Sayge
Bohannon, Katelyn Doe, Brooklynn Letourneau, Alex Percy, Lucia Aguila-Collantes
Prieto, Alba Castel Delgado, and Kayliese McCray, and
Whereas, Head Coach Liza Bordo, assistant coaches Randi Chagnon and Jennie Hull,
and Team Manager Megan Dussault were impressed with the Rockets’ amazing 3–2
championship victory, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2024 Richford Junior-Senior High
School Division IV championship girls’ soccer team, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Richford Junior-Senior High School.
