House concurrent resolution congratulating the 2024 Richford Junior-Senior High School Division
IV championship girls’ soccer team
Whereas, the 11th-seeded varsity athletic team in an annual interscholastic playoff series seldom
anticipates a championship game berth, but in the 2024 Division IV girls’ soccer competition, that was
the surprising result for the Richford Rockets, who demonstrated their true talent when they faced the
top-ranked and undefeated West Rutland Golden Horde in an exciting season finale at Rutland High
School’s field, and
Whereas, thrilled to have astounded their supporters, the Rockets aimed to prove their journey to this
special game would be happily memorable, and
Whereas, despite trailing 2–0 at the mid-game break, the Rockets played superbly during the second
half; first, scoring less than two minutes after play resumed; then, at the midpoint of the concluding
half; and finally, with 13:57 remaining of regulation time, all the while as the Richford defense
prevented West Rutland from increasing its side of the score, and
Whereas, the Rockets, who triumphantly returned home with Richford’s first-ever girls’ soccer title,
were Vanessa Tessier, Teddy Roberts, Keeley Long, Mikayla Chagnon, Adi Chagnon, Kyrielle Deuso,
Audrey Swanson, Jazmine Cunningham, Sayge Bohannon, Katelyn Doe, Brooklynn Letourneau, Alex
Percy, Lucia Aguila-Collantes Prieto, Alba Castel Delgado, and Kayliese McCray, and
Whereas, Head Coach Liza Bordo, assistant coaches Randi Chagnon and Jennie Hull, and Team
Manager Megan Dussault were impressed with the Rockets’ amazing 3–2 championship victory, now
therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2024 Richford Junior-Senior High School Division IV
championship girls’ soccer team, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to Richford
Junior-Senior High School.
