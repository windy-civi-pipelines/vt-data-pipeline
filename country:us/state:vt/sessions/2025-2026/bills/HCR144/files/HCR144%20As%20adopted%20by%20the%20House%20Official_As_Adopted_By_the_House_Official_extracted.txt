Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 144
Nigro of Bennington
Offered by Senators Bongartz and Plunkett
House concurrent resolution commemorating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps
Whereas, on November 10, 1775, now observed as the founding date of the U.S. Marine Corps, the Second
Continental Congress adopted a resolution directing the raising of two battalions of Marines, and John Adams
nominated Major Samuel Nicholas to serve as the first Commandant of the Continental Marines, and
Whereas, Major Nicholas organized the recruitment of the initial battalion of Continental Marines at the Tun
Tavern in Philadelphia, and the tavern’s owner, Robert Mullan, became the first Marine recruiter, and
Whereas, after comporting themselves magnificently during the American War of Independence, the
Continental Marines were disbanded in 1783, but on July 11, 1798, with the Quasi-War with France on the
horizon, the U.S. Congress adopted “An Act for Establishing and Organizing a Marine Corps” that officially
created the U.S. Marine Corps as part of the nation’s military, and
Whereas, during the War of 1812, the U.S. Marine Corps played pivotal roles in the Champlain Valley,
defending Plattsburg, and in the Battle of New Orleans, from which the service gained a coveted reputation for
its superb marksmanship, and
Whereas, in 1834, the U.S. Marine Corps was placed under the administrative structure of the U.S. Navy but
has always remained a distinctive service with both maritime and onshore roles, including protecting American
diplomatic facilities worldwide, and
Whereas, in 1883, the U.S. Marine Corps adopted the motto “Semper Fidelis” (Always Faithful), expressing
the loyalty of individual Marines to their fellow Marines, and they have distinguished themselves in battle ever
since, and
Whereas, in 1884 Acts and Resolves No. 180, the General Assembly incorporated “The Trustees of the
Soldiers’ Home in Vermont” (today’s Vermont Veterans’ Home in Bennington), and its U.S. Marine Corps
residents, who stay true to the spirit of Semper Fidelis and celebrate this 250th anniversary with great pride, as
does the nation, which is marking the occasion with commemorative stamps and coinage, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly commemorates the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the Vermont Veterans’
Home.
