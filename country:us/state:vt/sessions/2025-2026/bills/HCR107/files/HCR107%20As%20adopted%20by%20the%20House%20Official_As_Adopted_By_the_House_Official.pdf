House concurrent resolution congratulating the Rice Memorial High School Green Knights boys’ ice hockey
team on winning a second consecutive Division I championship
Whereas, endless superlatives are the only way to describe the Green Knights’ 2024–2025 season on the ice
as they surpassed their 2023–2024 Division I season in innumerable ways, and
Whereas, Rice was an offensive powerhouse this season, overwhelming their opponents on the scoreboard
136–17, and they remained undefeated, sporting an overall record of 23–0, and
Whereas, retaining that perfect win-loss record was briefly in doubt during the Division I championship
game at the University of Vermont’s Gutterson Fieldhouse, where the top-seeded Green Knights faced off
against the No. 3 South Burlington Wolves, and
Whereas, the Wolves scored first at 2:35 into the first period, but Rice returned the favor merely 31 seconds
later, and despite the Wolves tying the score at 2–all early in the third period, Rice focused intensely, securing a
4–2 victory and the 2025 Division I crown, and
Whereas, Green Knights Griffin Seitz, Wesley Casavant, Oliver Quong, Brendan Patterson, Ryder Donati,
Joe Alexander, Walter Morris, Jack Lemon, Tyler Russo, Chais Lyford, John Fernandez, Vincent Lanzetta,
Peyton Albertson, Pierre Heroux, Tucker Martin, Evan Welcome, Luke Sensac, Jack Webb, Baylor Lamos,
Gunnar Mink, Mason Bilodeau, Tyler Ritchie, Carlo Pizzagalli, Garrett Pilon, Connor Williams, Henry
Monaghan, and John Novak commanded the ice with confidence, and
Whereas, Head Coach Justin Martin; assistant coaches Jerry Tarrant, Aaron Miller, Brady Leisenring, and
Shea Spanier; as well as team managers Jordan Hutchins, Owen Cook, and Patrick Raleigh were delighted with
the team’s success, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the Rice Memorial High School Green Knights boys’ ice hockey
team on winning a second consecutive Division I championship, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to Rice Memorial High
School.
