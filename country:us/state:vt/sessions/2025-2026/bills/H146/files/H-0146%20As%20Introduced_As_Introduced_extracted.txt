1 waters of the State, including dairy and other livestock operations plus all
2 forms of crop and nursery operations and on-farm or agricultural fairground,
3 registered pursuant to 20 V.S.A. § 3902, livestock and poultry slaughter and
4 processing activities. The RAPs shall include, as well as promote and
5 encourage, practices for farmers in preventing agricultural pollutants from
6 entering the groundwater and waters of the State when engaged in animal
7 waste management and disposal, soil amendment applications, plant
8 fertilization, and pest and weed control. Persons engaged in farming who are
9 in compliance with these practices shall be presumed to not have a discharge of
10 agricultural pollutants to waters of the State. RAPs shall be designed to protect
11 water quality and shall be practical and cost-effective to implement, as
12 determined by the Secretary. Where the Secretary determines, after inspection
13 of a farm, that a person engaged in farming is complying with the RAPs but
14 there still exists the potential for agricultural pollutants to enter the waters of
15 the State, the Secretary shall require the person to implement additional, site-
16 specific on-farm conservation practices designed to prevent agricultural
17 pollutants from entering the waters of the State. When requiring
18 implementation of a conservation practice under this subsection, the Secretary
19 shall inform the person engaged in farming of the resources available to assist
20 the person in implementing the conservation practice and complying with the
21 requirements of this chapter. The RAPs for groundwater shall include a

3 property owner. A farmer may petition the Secretary to reduce the size of a
4 perennial buffer or change the perennial buffer type based on site-specific
5 conditions.
6 (c) Best management practices. Best management practices (BMPs) are
7 site-specific on-farm conservation practices implemented in order to address
8 the potential for agricultural pollutants to enter the waters of the State. The
9 Secretary may require any person engaged in farming to implement a BMP.
10 When requiring implementation of a BMP, the Secretary shall inform a farmer
11 of financial resources available from State or federal sources, private
12 foundations, public charities, or other sources, including funding from the
13 Clean Water Fund established under 10 V.S.A. § 1388, to assist the person in
14 implementing BMPs and complying with the requirements of this chapter.
15 BMPs shall be practical and cost effective to implement, as determined by the
16 Secretary, and shall be designed to achieve compliance with the requirements
17 of this chapter. The Secretary may require soil monitoring or innovative
18 manure management as a BMP under this subsection. Soil monitoring or
19 innovative manure management implemented as a BMP shall be eligible for
20 State assistance under the Clean Water Fund established under 10 V.S.A.
21 chapter 47, subchapter 7. If a perennial buffer of trees or other woody

2 forms of crop and nursery operations and on-farm or agricultural fairground,
3 registered pursuant to 20 V.S.A. § 3902, livestock and poultry slaughter and
4 processing activities. The RAPs shall include, as well as promote and
5 encourage, practices for farmers in preventing agricultural pollutants from
6 entering the groundwater and waters of the State when engaged in animal
7 waste management and disposal, soil amendment applications, plant
8 fertilization, and pest and weed control. Persons engaged in farming who are
9 in compliance with these practices shall be presumed to not have a discharge of
10 agricultural pollutants to waters of the State. RAPs shall be designed to protect
11 water quality and shall be practical and cost-effective to implement, as
12 determined by the Secretary. Where the Secretary determines, after inspection
13 of a farm, that a person engaged in farming is complying with the RAPs but
14 there still exists the potential for agricultural pollutants to enter the waters of
15 the State, the Secretary shall require the person to implement additional, site-
16 specific on-farm conservation practices designed to prevent agricultural
17 pollutants from entering the waters of the State. When requiring
18 implementation of a conservation practice under this subsection, the Secretary
19 shall inform the person engaged in farming of the resources available to assist
20 the person in implementing the conservation practice and complying with the
21 requirements of this chapter. The RAPs for groundwater shall include a
