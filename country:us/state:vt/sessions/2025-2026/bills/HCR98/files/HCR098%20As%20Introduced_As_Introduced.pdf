House concurrent resolution congratulating the 2025 EssexHigh School Hornets Division I
championship girls’ ice hockey team
Whereas, the laurels of Hornets’ girls’ ice hockey are plentiful, and 2025 extended this history of
amazing successes, and
Whereas, the fourth-ranked Hornets faced off against the second-seeded BFA-St. Albans Comets, in a
game that marked an extraordinary interscholastic contest on the Gutterson Fieldhouse ice, and
Whereas, the Hornets assumed the lead early, and by the first period’s conclusion, Essexheld a 3–0
lead that was the foundation for a convincing 5–1 triumph, and
Whereas, aside from the great victory, Essexplayers achieved special individual records for a
Division I girls’ ice hockey championship game, with one Hornet scoring only the third hat trick in the
series’ history and another tallying only the second four-goal contest, and
Whereas, these amazing ice hockey players were Morgan Hughart, Eleanor Hutton, Clover Bowker,
Aliyah Rassel, Jemma Brinker, Zuzu Rooney, Leah Labombard, Taylor Senecal, Abigail Desilets, Lucia
Minadeo, Emily Stempek, Leah Miller, Mackenzie O’Connell, Emma Airoldi, Charlotte Abajian, Alexis
Moody, Lucille Mehaffey, Rowan MacAndrews, Calleigh Bruyns, Isabella Boutin, Catherine
McDonough, Kathryn Cavalier, and Sophie Krauss, and
Whereas, Head Coach Gerald Gernander; assistant coaches Tracy Muzerall, Casey Bezamat, and
Rich Celia; and student managers Jillian Goulette, Reese Holcomb, and Lauren Soulia were all major
contributors to the Hornets’ 10th Division I crown, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2025 EssexHigh School Hornets Division I
championship girls’ ice hockey team, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to EssexHigh
School.
