Whereas, the laurels of Hornets’ girls’ ice hockey are plentiful, and 2025 extended this
history of amazing successes, and
Whereas, the fourth-ranked Hornets faced off against the second-seeded BFA-St.
Albans Comets, in a game that marked an extraordinary interscholastic contest on the
Gutterson Fieldhouse ice, and
Whereas, the Hornets assumed the lead early, and by the first period’s conclusion,
Essex held a 3–0 lead that was the foundation for a convincing 5–1 triumph, and
Whereas, aside from the great victory, Essex players achieved special individual
records for a Division I girls’ ice hockey championship game, with one Hornet scoring
only the third hat trick in the series’ history and another tallying only the second four-
goal contest, and
Whereas, these amazing ice hockey players were Morgan Hughart, Eleanor Hutton,
Clover Bowker, Aliyah Rassel, Jemma Brinker, Zuzu Rooney, Leah Labombard, Taylor
Senecal, Abigail Desilets, Lucia Minadeo, Emily Stempek, Leah Miller, Mackenzie
O’Connell, Emma Airoldi, Charlotte Abajian, Alexis Moody, Lucille Mehaffey, Rowan
MacAndrews, Calleigh Bruyns, Isabella Boutin, Catherine McDonough, Kathryn
Cavalier, and Sophie Krauss, and
Whereas, Head Coach Gerald Gernander; assistant coaches Tracy Muzerall, Casey
Bezamat, and Rich Celia; and student managers Jillian Goulette, Reese Holcomb, and
Lauren Soulia were all major contributors to the Hornets’ 10th Division I crown, now
therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2025 Essex High School Hornets
Division I championship girls’ ice hockey team, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Essex High School.
