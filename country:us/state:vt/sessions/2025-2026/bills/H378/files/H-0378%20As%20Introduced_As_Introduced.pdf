16 housing development site the amount by which the total valuation as

7 shall remit not less than the aggregate tax due on the original taxable value to

9 (d) Throughout the life of the housing development site, the municipality
10 shall hold apart, rather than remit to the taxing districts, that proportion of all
11 taxes paid that year on the real property within the housing development site

5 financing account.

7 taxes assessed within a housing development site shall be subject to the

9 of this title or under a municipal charter shall not be considered property taxes
10 for the purpose of this section if the proceeds are used exclusively for
11 operating expenses related to properties within the housing development site
12 and not for the housing infrastructure project.
