Act No. 17 (H.206). An act relating to the Uniform Commercial Code
Subjects: Uniform Commercial Code
This act makes changes the Uniform Commercial Code, codified in Title 9A of the
V.S.A. The Uniform Law Commission, which oversees the model language of the
Uniform Commercial Code, adopted a set of new recommendations for states to adopt in
2022. The Uniform Commercial Code is most effective when all states have the same
language, so this act adopts all of the 2022 recommendations from the Uniform Law
Commission. Besides various technical updates, notable in these amendments is the
adoption of a new Article 12, which provides commercial law rules for transactions
involving controllable electronic records. These records include emerging technologies,
such as virtual currencies and electronic chattel paper.
