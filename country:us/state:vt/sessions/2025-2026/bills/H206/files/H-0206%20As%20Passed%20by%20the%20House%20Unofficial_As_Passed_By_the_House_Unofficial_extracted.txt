13 EXCLUDED FROM THIS ARTICLE
14 Unless the context otherwise requires, this article applies to transactions in
15 goods; it does not apply to any transaction which although in the form of an
16 unconditional contract to sell or present sale is intended to operate only as a
17 security transaction nor does this article impair or repeal any statute regulating
18 sales to consumers, farmers or other specified classes of buyers.
19 (a) Unless the context otherwise requires, and except as provided in
20 subsection (c) of this section, this article applies to transactions in goods and,

2 (b) In a hybrid transaction:
3 (1) If the sale-of-goods aspects do not predominate, only the provisions
4 of this article which relate primarily to the sale-of-goods aspects of the
5 transaction apply, and the provisions that relate primarily to the transaction as a
6 whole do not apply.
7 (2) If the sale-of-goods aspects predominate, this article applies to the
8 transaction but does not preclude application in appropriate circumstances of
9 other law to aspects of the transaction which do not relate to the sale of goods.
10 (c) This article does not:
11 (1) apply to a transaction that, even though in the form of an
12 unconditional contract to sell or present sale, operates only to create a security
13 interest; or
14 (2) impair or repeal a statute regulating sales to consumers, farmers, or
15 other specified classes of buyers.

7 § 2—201. FORMAL REQUIREMENTS; STATUTE OF FRAUDS
8 (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section a contract for the sale of
9 goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or
10 defense unless there is some writing a record sufficient to indicate that a
11 contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party
12 against whom enforcement is sought or by his the party’s authorized agent or
13 broker. A writing record is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly
14 states a term agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under this
15 paragraph subsection beyond the quantity of goods shown in such writing the
16 record.
17 (2) Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing record in
18 confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and
19 the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the
20 requirements of subsection (1) against such the party unless written notice in a
21 record of objection to its contents is given within ten days after it is received.

17 offer to buy or sell goods does not constitute the writing record a sealed

15 bank, transmitted orally, electronically, or in writing or in a record, to pay, or

20 (ii) the receiving bank is to be reimbursed by debiting an account of,
21 or otherwise receiving payment from, the sender; and
VT LEG #381760 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.206
2025 Page 19 of 124
1 (iii) the instruction is transmitted by the sender directly to the
2 receiving bank or to an agent, funds-transfer system, or communication system
3 for transmittal to the receiving bank.
4 * * *
5 § 4A—201. SECURITY PROCEDURE
6 “Security procedure” means a procedure established by agreement of a
7 customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of (i) verifying that a payment
8 order or communication amending or cancelling a payment order is that of the
9 customer, or (ii) detecting error in the transmission or the content of the
10 payment order or communication. A security procedure may impose an
11 obligation on the receiving bank or the customer and may require the use of
12 algorithms or other codes, identifying words or, numbers, symbols, sounds,
13 biometrics, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices.
14 Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an
15 authorized specimen signature of the customer or requiring a payment order to
16 be sent from a known email address, IP address, or telephone number is not by
17 itself a security procedure.
18 § 4A—202. AUTHORIZED AND VERIFIED PAYMENT ORDERS
19 * * *
20 (b) If a bank and its customer have agreed that the authenticity of payment
21 orders issued to the bank in the name of the customer as sender will be verified
VT LEG #381760 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.206
2025 Page 20 of 124
1 pursuant to a security procedure, a payment order received by the receiving
2 bank is effective as the order of the customer, whether or not authorized, if (i)
3 the security procedure is a commercially reasonable method of providing
4 security against unauthorized payment orders, and (ii) the bank proves that it
5 accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance with the bank’s
6 obligations under the security procedure and any written agreement or
7 instruction of the customer, evidenced by a record, restricting acceptance of
8 payment orders issued in the name of the customer. The bank is not required
9 to follow an instruction that violates a written an agreement with the customer,
10 evidenced by a record, or notice of which is not received at a time and in a
11 manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the
12 payment order is accepted.
13 (c) Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of law
14 to be determined by considering the wishes of the customer expressed to the
15 bank, the circumstances of the customer known to the bank, including the size,
16 type, and frequency of payment orders normally issued by the customer to the
17 bank, alternative security procedures offered to the customer, and security
18 procedures in general use by customers and receiving banks similarly situated.
19 A security procedure is deemed to be commercially reasonable if (i) the
20 security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and the
21 customer refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for
VT LEG #381760 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.206
2025 Page 21 of 124
1 that customer, and (ii) the customer expressly agreed in writing a record to be
2 bound by any payment order, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and
3 accepted by the bank in compliance with the bank’s obligations under the
4 security procedure chosen by the customer.

6 § 4A—203. UNENFORCEABILITY OF CERTAIN VERIFIED PAYMENT
7 ORDERS
8 (a) If an accepted payment order is not, under subsection 4A—202(a) of
9 this title, an authorized order of a customer identified as sender, but is effective
10 as an order of the customer pursuant to subsection 4A—202(b) of this title, the
11 following rules apply:
12 (1) By express written agreement evidenced by a record, the receiving
13 bank may limit the extent to which it is entitled to enforce or retain payment of
14 the payment order.

16 § 4A—207. MISDESCRIPTION OF BENEFICIARY
17 * * *
18 (c) If (i) a payment order described in subsection (b) of this section is
19 accepted, (ii) the originator’s payment order described the beneficiary
20 inconsistently by name and number, and (iii) the beneficiary’s bank pays the

2025 Page 22 of 124
1 person identified by number as permitted by subdivision (b)(1) of this section,
2 the following rules apply:
3 (1) If the originator is a bank, the originator is obliged to pay its order.
4 (2) If the originator is not a bank and proves that the person identified

8 right to performance, or other interest in property.
9 (g) An action may not be asserted against a qualifying purchaser based on
10 both a purchase by the qualifying purchaser of a controllable electronic record

15 of a property right in a controllable electronic record.
16 12—105. CONTROL OF CONTROLLABLE ELECTRONIC RECORD

18 record, a record attached to or logically associated with the electronic record,
19 or a system in which the electronic record is recorded:
20 (1) gives the person:
21 (A) power to avail itself of substantially all the benefit from the
VT LEG #381760 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.206
2025 Page 111 of 124

13 (1) the controllable electronic record, a record attached to or logically
14 associated with the electronic record, or a system in which the electronic
15 record is recorded limits the use of the electronic record or has a protocol
16 programmed to cause a change, including a transfer or loss of control or a
17 modification of benefits afforded by the electronic record; or
18 (2) the power is shared with another person.
19 (c) A power of a person is not shared with another person under
20 subdivision (b)(2) of this section and the person’s power is not exclusive if:
21 (1) the person can exercise the power only if the power also is exercised
VT LEG #381760 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.206
2025 Page 112 of 124
1 by the other person; and
2 (2) the other person:

8 (d) If a person has the powers specified in subdivisions (a)(1)(B)(i) and (ii)
9 of this section, the powers are presumed to be exclusive.

17 that it will obtain control of the electronic record on behalf of the person.
18 (f) A person that has control under this section is not required to
19 acknowledge that it has control on behalf of another person.
20 (g) If a person acknowledges that it has or will obtain control on behalf of
21 another person, unless the person otherwise agrees or law other than this article
VT LEG #381760 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.206
2025 Page 113 of 124
1 or Article 9 otherwise provides, the person does not owe any duty to the other
2 person and is not required to confirm the acknowledgment to any other person.
3 12—106. DISCHARGE OF ACCOUNT DEBTOR ON CONTROLLABLE
4 ACCOUNT OR CONTROLLABLE PAYMENT INTANGIBLE
5 (a) An account debtor on a controllable account or controllable payment
6 intangible may discharge its obligation by paying:
7 (1) the person having control of the controllable electronic record that
8 evidences the controllable account or controllable payment intangible; or

10 formerly had control of the controllable electronic record.
11 (b) Subject to subsection (d) of this section, the account debtor may not
12 discharge its obligation by paying a person that formerly had control of the
13 controllable electronic record if the account debtor receives a notification that:
14 (1) is signed by a person that formerly had control or the person to
15 which control was transferred;
16 (2) reasonably identifies the controllable account or controllable
17 payment intangible;
18 (3) notifies the account debtor that control of the controllable electronic
19 record that evidences the controllable account or controllable payment
20 intangible was transferred;
VT LEG #381760 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.206
2025 Page 114 of 124
1 (4) identifies the transferee, in any reasonable way, including by name,
2 identifying number, cryptographic key, office, or account number; and
3 (5) provides a commercially reasonable method by which the account
4 debtor is to pay the transferee.
5 (c) After receipt of a notification that complies with subsection (b) of this
6 section, the account debtor may discharge its obligation by paying in
7 accordance with the notification and may not discharge the obligation by
8 paying a person that formerly had control.
9 (d) Subject to subsection (h) of this section, notification is ineffective under
10 subsection (b) of this section:
11 (1) unless, before the notification is sent, the account debtor and the
12 person that, at that time, had control of the controllable electronic record that
13 evidences the controllable account or controllable payment intangible agree in
14 a signed record to a commercially reasonable method by which a person may
15 furnish reasonable proof that control has been transferred;
16 (2) to the extent an agreement between the account debtor and seller of a
17 payment intangible limits the account debtor’s duty to pay a person other than
18 the seller and the limitation is effective under law other than this article; or
19 (3) at the option of the account debtor, if the notification notifies the
20 account debtor to:
VT LEG #381760 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.206
2025 Page 115 of 124
1 (A) divide a payment;

7 debtor, the person giving the notification under subsection (b) of this section
8 seasonably shall furnish reasonable proof, using the method in the agreement
9 referred to in subdivision (d)(1) of this section, that control of the controllable
10 electronic record has been transferred. Unless the person complies with the
11 request, the account debtor may discharge its obligation by paying a person
12 that formerly had control, even if the account debtor has received a notification
13 under subsection (b) of this section.
14 (f) A person furnishes reasonable proof under subsection (e) of this section
15 that control has been transferred if the person demonstrates, using the method
16 in the agreement referred to in subdivision (d)(1) of this section, that the
17 transferee has the power to:
18 (1) avail itself of substantially all the benefit from the controllable
19 electronic record;
20 (2) prevent others from availing themselves of substantially all the
21 benefit from the controllable electronic record; and

7 different rule for an account debtor who is an individual and who incurred the
8 obligation primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.
9 12—107. GOVERNING LAW
10 (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the local law of a
11 controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction governs a matter covered by this
12 article.
13 (b) For a controllable electronic record that evidences a controllable
14 account or controllable payment intangible, the local law of the controllable
15 electronic record’s jurisdiction governs a matter covered by section 12—106 of
16 this title unless an effective agreement determines that the local law of another
17 jurisdiction governs.
18 (c) The following rules determine a controllable electronic record’s
19 jurisdiction under this section:
20 (1) If the controllable electronic record, or a record attached to or
21 logically associated with the controllable electronic record and readily
VT LEG #381760 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.206
2025 Page 117 of 124
1 available for review, expressly provides that a particular jurisdiction is the
2 controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction for purposes of this article or title,
3 that jurisdiction is the controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction.
4 (2) If subdivision (1) of this subsection does not apply and the rules of
5 the system in which the controllable electronic record is recorded are readily
6 available for review and expressly provide that a particular jurisdiction is the
7 controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction for purposes of this article or title,
8 that jurisdiction is the controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction.
9 (3) If subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection do not apply and the
10 controllable electronic record, or a record attached to or logically associated
11 with the controllable electronic record and readily available for review,

13 law of a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the controllable electronic
14 record’s jurisdiction.
15 (4) If subdivisions (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection do not apply and
16 the rules of the system in which the controllable electronic record is recorded
17 are readily available for review and expressly provide that the controllable
VT LEG #381760 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.206

1 electronic record or the system is governed by the law of a particular
2 jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction.
3 (5) If subdivisions (1)–(4) of this subsection do not apply, the
4 controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction is the District of Columbia.
5 (d) If subdivision (5) of subsection (c) of this section applies and Article 12
6 is not in effect in the District of Columbia without material modification, the
7 governing law for a matter covered by this article is the law of the District of
8 Columbia as though Article 12 were in effect in the District of Columbia
9 without material modification. In this subsection, “Article 12” means Article
10 12 of Uniform Commercial Code Amendments (2022).
11 (e) To the extent subsections (a) and (b) of this section provide that the
12 local law of the controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction governs a matter
13 covered by this article, that law governs even if the matter or a transaction to
14 which the matter relates does not bear any relation to the controllable
15 electronic record’s jurisdiction.
16 (f) The rights acquired under section 12—104 of this title by a purchaser or
17 qualifying purchaser are governed by the law applicable under this section at
18 the time of purchase.

2025 Page 121 of 124
1 this act or Article 12 if it had been entered into, created, or transferred on or

9 (c) Security interest perfected before effective date.
10 (1) A security interest that is enforceable and perfected immediately

14 (2) If a security interest is enforceable and perfected immediately before
15 the July 1, 2025, but the requirements for enforceability or perfection under
16 this act are not satisfied on July 1, 2025, the security interest:

18 perfection would have ceased under the law in effect immediately before July
19 1, 2025 or the adjustment date;

VT LEG #381760 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.206
2025 Page 123 of 124
1 2025, the action is effective to perfect a security interest that attaches under
2 this act before the adjustment date. An attached security interest becomes
3 unperfected on the adjustment date unless the security interest becomes a
4 perfected security interest under this act before the adjustment date.
5 (2) The filing of a financing statement before July 1, 2025 is effective to
6 perfect a security interest on July 1, 2025 to the extent the filing would satisfy
7 the requirements for perfection under this act.

5 of Article 9 as amended by this act do not apply and the priorities of claims to
6 Article 12 property were established before July 1, 2025, law other than Article
7 12 determines priority.
8 (3) When the priority rules of Article 9 as amended by this act do not
9 apply, to the extent the priorities determined by this act modify the priorities
10 established before July 1, 2025, the priorities of claims to Article 12 property

13 EXCLUDED FROM THIS ARTICLE
14 Unless the context otherwise requires, this article applies to transactions in
15 goods; it does not apply to any transaction which although in the form of an
16 unconditional contract to sell or present sale is intended to operate only as a
17 security transaction nor does this article impair or repeal any statute regulating
18 sales to consumers, farmers or other specified classes of buyers.
19 (a) Unless the context otherwise requires, and except as provided in
20 subsection (c) of this section, this article applies to transactions in goods and,
21 in the case of a hybrid transaction, it applies to the extent provided in
VT LEG #381760 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.206

2 (b) In a hybrid transaction:
3 (1) If the sale-of-goods aspects do not predominate, only the provisions
4 of this article which relate primarily to the sale-of-goods aspects of the
5 transaction apply, and the provisions that relate primarily to the transaction as a
6 whole do not apply.
7 (2) If the sale-of-goods aspects predominate, this article applies to the
8 transaction but does not preclude application in appropriate circumstances of
9 other law to aspects of the transaction which do not relate to the sale of goods.
10 (c) This article does not:
11 (1) apply to a transaction that, even though in the form of an
12 unconditional contract to sell or present sale, operates only to create a security
13 interest; or
14 (2) impair or repeal a statute regulating sales to consumers, farmers, or
15 other specified classes of buyers.

6 * * *
7 § 2—201. FORMAL REQUIREMENTS; STATUTE OF FRAUDS
8 (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section a contract for the sale of
9 goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or
10 defense unless there is some writing a record sufficient to indicate that a
11 contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party
12 against whom enforcement is sought or by his the party’s authorized agent or
13 broker. A writing record is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly
14 states a term agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under this
15 paragraph subsection beyond the quantity of goods shown in such writing the
16 record.
17 (2) Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing record in
18 confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and
19 the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the
20 requirements of subsection (1) against such the party unless written notice in a
21 record of objection to its contents is given within ten days after it is received.

4 Terms with respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the parties
5 agree or which are otherwise set forth in a writing record intended by the
6 parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as
7 are included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior
8 agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be explained or
9 supplemented:
10 (a) by course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade (§ 1—
11 303); and
12 (b) by evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the
13 writing record to have been intended also as a complete and exclusive
14 statement of the terms of the agreement.
15 § 2—203. SEALS INOPERATIVE
16 The affixing of a seal to a writing record evidencing a contract for sale or an
17 offer to buy or sell goods does not constitute the writing record a sealed
18 instrument and the law with respect to sealed instruments does not apply to
19 such a contract or offer.

6 months; but any such term of assurance on a form supplied by the offeree must
7 be separately signed by the offeror.

13 by a signed writing or other signed record cannot be otherwise modified or
14 rescinded, but except as between merchants such a requirement on a form

12 § 4A—103. PAYMENT ORDER—DEFINITIONS
13 (a) In this article:
14 (1) “Payment order” means an instruction of a sender to a receiving
15 bank, transmitted orally, electronically, or in writing or in a record, to pay, or
16 to cause another bank to pay, a fixed or determinable amount of money to a
17 beneficiary if:
18 (i) the instruction does not state a condition to payment to the
19 beneficiary other than time of payment;
20 (ii) the receiving bank is to be reimbursed by debiting an account of,
21 or otherwise receiving payment from, the sender; and
VT LEG #381760 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.206
2025 Page 19 of 124
1 (iii) the instruction is transmitted by the sender directly to the
2 receiving bank or to an agent, funds-transfer system, or communication system
3 for transmittal to the receiving bank.
4 * * *
5 § 4A—201. SECURITY PROCEDURE
6 “Security procedure” means a procedure established by agreement of a
7 customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of (i) verifying that a payment
8 order or communication amending or cancelling a payment order is that of the
9 customer, or (ii) detecting error in the transmission or the content of the
10 payment order or communication. A security procedure may impose an
11 obligation on the receiving bank or the customer and may require the use of
12 algorithms or other codes, identifying words or, numbers, symbols, sounds,
13 biometrics, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices.
14 Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an
15 authorized specimen signature of the customer or requiring a payment order to
16 be sent from a known email address, IP address, or telephone number is not by
17 itself a security procedure.
18 § 4A—202. AUTHORIZED AND VERIFIED PAYMENT ORDERS
19 * * *
20 (b) If a bank and its customer have agreed that the authenticity of payment
21 orders issued to the bank in the name of the customer as sender will be verified
VT LEG #381760 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.206
2025 Page 20 of 124
1 pursuant to a security procedure, a payment order received by the receiving
2 bank is effective as the order of the customer, whether or not authorized, if (i)
3 the security procedure is a commercially reasonable method of providing
4 security against unauthorized payment orders, and (ii) the bank proves that it
5 accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance with the bank’s
6 obligations under the security procedure and any written agreement or
7 instruction of the customer, evidenced by a record, restricting acceptance of
8 payment orders issued in the name of the customer. The bank is not required
9 to follow an instruction that violates a written an agreement with the customer,
10 evidenced by a record, or notice of which is not received at a time and in a
11 manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the
12 payment order is accepted.
13 (c) Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of law
14 to be determined by considering the wishes of the customer expressed to the
15 bank, the circumstances of the customer known to the bank, including the size,
16 type, and frequency of payment orders normally issued by the customer to the
17 bank, alternative security procedures offered to the customer, and security
18 procedures in general use by customers and receiving banks similarly situated.
19 A security procedure is deemed to be commercially reasonable if (i) the
20 security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and the
21 customer refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for
VT LEG #381760 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.206

1 that customer, and (ii) the customer expressly agreed in writing a record to be
2 bound by any payment order, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and
3 accepted by the bank in compliance with the bank’s obligations under the
4 security procedure chosen by the customer.

6 § 4A—203. UNENFORCEABILITY OF CERTAIN VERIFIED PAYMENT
7 ORDERS
8 (a) If an accepted payment order is not, under subsection 4A—202(a) of
9 this title, an authorized order of a customer identified as sender, but is effective
10 as an order of the customer pursuant to subsection 4A—202(b) of this title, the
11 following rules apply:
12 (1) By express written agreement evidenced by a record, the receiving
13 bank may limit the extent to which it is entitled to enforce or retain payment of
14 the payment order.

16 § 4A—207. MISDESCRIPTION OF BENEFICIARY
17 * * *
18 (c) If (i) a payment order described in subsection (b) of this section is
19 accepted, (ii) the originator’s payment order described the beneficiary
20 inconsistently by name and number, and (iii) the beneficiary’s bank pays the
VT LEG #381760 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.206
2025 Page 22 of 124
1 person identified by number as permitted by subdivision (b)(1) of this section,
2 the following rules apply:
3 (1) If the originator is a bank, the originator is obliged to pay its order.
4 (2) If the originator is not a bank and proves that the person identified
5 by number was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the
6 originator is not obliged to pay its order unless the originator’s bank proves
7 that the originator, before acceptance of the originator’s order, had notice that
8 payment of a payment order issued by the originator might be made by the
9 beneficiary’s bank on the basis of an identifying or bank account number even
10 if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. Proof of notice
11 may be made by any admissible evidence. The originator’s bank satisfies the
12 burden of proof if it proves that the originator, before the payment order was
13 accepted, signed a writing record stating the information to which the notice
14 relates.
15 * * *
16 § 4A—208. MISDESCRIPTION OF INTERMEDIARY BANK OR
17 BENEFICIARY’S BANK
18 * * *
19 (b) This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary
20 bank or the beneficiary’s bank both by name and an identifying number if the
21 name and number identify different persons.

2 (2) If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank proves that the
3 sender, before the payment order was accepted, had notice that the receiving
4 bank might rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary
5 or beneficiary’s bank even if it identifies a person different from the bank
6 identified by name, the rights and obligations of the sender and the receiving
7 bank are governed by subdivision (1) of this subsection, as though the sender
8 were a bank. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The
9 receiving bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the sender, before
10 the payment order was accepted, signed a writing record stating the
11 information to which the notice relates.
12 * * *
13 § 4A—210. REJECTION OF PAYMENT ORDER
14 (a) A payment order is rejected by the receiving bank by a notice of
15 rejection transmitted to the sender orally, electronically, or in writing a record.
16 A notice of rejection need not use any particular words and is sufficient if it
17 indicates that the receiving bank is rejecting the order or will not execute or
18 pay the order. Rejection is effective when the notice is given if transmission is
19 by a means that is reasonable in the circumstances. If notice of rejection is
20 given by a means that is not reasonable, rejection is effective when the notice
21 is received. If an agreement of the sender and receiving bank establishes the

4 noncomplying means.

6 § 4A—211. CANCELLATION AND AMENDMENT OF PAYMENT
7 ORDER
8 (a) A communication of the sender of a payment order cancelling or
9 amending the order may be transmitted to the receiving bank orally,
10 electronically, or in writing a record. If a security procedure is in effect
11 between the sender and the receiving bank, the communication is not effective
12 to cancel or amend the order unless the communication is verified pursuant to
13 the security procedure or the bank agrees to the cancellation or amendment.

15 record is recorded limits the use of the electronic record or has a protocol
16 programmed to cause a change, including a transfer or loss of control or a

15 which control was transferred;
16 (2) reasonably identifies the controllable account or controllable
17 payment intangible;
18 (3) notifies the account debtor that control of the controllable electronic
19 record that evidences the controllable account or controllable payment
20 intangible was transferred;

6 section, the account debtor may discharge its obligation by paying in
7 accordance with the notification and may not discharge the obligation by
8 paying a person that formerly had control.

10 subsection (b) of this section:
11 (1) unless, before the notification is sent, the account debtor and the
12 person that, at that time, had control of the controllable electronic record that
13 evidences the controllable account or controllable payment intangible agree in
14 a signed record to a commercially reasonable method by which a person may
15 furnish reasonable proof that control has been transferred;
16 (2) to the extent an agreement between the account debtor and seller of a
17 payment intangible limits the account debtor’s duty to pay a person other than
18 the seller and the limitation is effective under law other than this article; or
19 (3) at the option of the account debtor, if the notification notifies the

8 seasonably shall furnish reasonable proof, using the method in the agreement
9 referred to in subdivision (d)(1) of this section, that control of the controllable
10 electronic record has been transferred. Unless the person complies with the

12 that formerly had control, even if the account debtor has received a notification
13 under subsection (b) of this section.
14 (f) A person furnishes reasonable proof under subsection (e) of this section
15 that control has been transferred if the person demonstrates, using the method
16 in the agreement referred to in subdivision (d)(1) of this section, that the

19 electronic record;
20 (2) prevent others from availing themselves of substantially all the
21 benefit from the controllable electronic record; and

4 controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction is the District of Columbia.
5 (d) If subdivision (5) of subsection (c) of this section applies and Article 12
6 is not in effect in the District of Columbia without material modification, the
7 governing law for a matter covered by this article is the law of the District of
8 Columbia as though Article 12 were in effect in the District of Columbia
9 without material modification. In this subsection, “Article 12” means Article
10 12 of Uniform Commercial Code Amendments (2022).
11 (e) To the extent subsections (a) and (b) of this section provide that the
12 local law of the controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction governs a matter
13 covered by this article, that law governs even if the matter or a transaction to
14 which the matter relates does not bear any relation to the controllable
15 electronic record’s jurisdiction.
16 (f) The rights acquired under section 12—104 of this title by a purchaser or
17 qualifying purchaser are governed by the law applicable under this section at
18 the time of purchase.

7 (3) This act does not affect an action, case, or proceeding commenced
8 before July 1, 2025.
9 (c) Security interest perfected before effective date.
10 (1) A security interest that is enforceable and perfected immediately
11 before July 1, 2025 is a perfected security interest under this act if, on July 1,

13 satisfied without further action.
14 (2) If a security interest is enforceable and perfected immediately before
15 the July 1, 2025, but the requirements for enforceability or perfection under
16 this act are not satisfied on July 1, 2025, the security interest:

18 perfection would have ceased under the law in effect immediately before July
19 1, 2025 or the adjustment date;

21 satisfies the requirements for enforceability under section 9—203 of the
VT LEG #381760 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.206
2025 Page 122 of 124

5 (A) of this subdivision (c)(2).
6 (d) Security interest unperfected before effective date. A security interest
7 that is enforceable immediately before July 1, 2025 but is unperfected at that
8 time:
9 (1) remains an enforceable security interest until the adjustment date;

11 enforceable under section 9—203 of the Uniform Commercial Code, as
12 amended by this act, on July 1, 2025 or before the adjustment date; and
13 (3) becomes perfected:
14 (A) without further action, on July 1, 2025 if the requirements for

VT LEG #381760 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.206
2025 Page 123 of 124
1 2025, the action is effective to perfect a security interest that attaches under
2 this act before the adjustment date. An attached security interest becomes
3 unperfected on the adjustment date unless the security interest becomes a
4 perfected security interest under this act before the adjustment date.
5 (2) The filing of a financing statement before July 1, 2025 is effective to
6 perfect a security interest on July 1, 2025 to the extent the filing would satisfy
7 the requirements for perfection under this act.
8 (3) The taking of an action before July 1, 2025 is sufficient for the
9 enforceability of a security interest on July 1, 2025 if the action would satisfy
10 the requirements for enforceability under this act.
11 (f) Priority.
12 (1) Subject to subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection, this act
13 determines the priority of conflicting claims to collateral.
14 (2) Subject to subdivision (3) of this subsection, if the priorities of
15 claims to collateral were established before July 1, 2025, Article 9 as in effect
16 before July 1, 2025 determines priority.
17 (3) On the adjustment date, to the extent the priorities determined by
18 Article 9 as amended by this act modify the priorities established before July 1,
19 2025, the priorities of claims to Article 12 property and electronic money
20 established before July 1, 2025 cease to apply.
21 (g) Priority of claims when priority rules of Article 9 do not apply.
VT LEG #381760 v.1

4 (2) Subject to subdivision (3) of this subsection, when the priority rules
5 of Article 9 as amended by this act do not apply and the priorities of claims to
6 Article 12 property were established before July 1, 2025, law other than Article
7 12 determines priority.
8 (3) When the priority rules of Article 9 as amended by this act do not
9 apply, to the extent the priorities determined by this act modify the priorities
10 established before July 1, 2025, the priorities of claims to Article 12 property
11 established before July 1, 2025 cease to apply on the adjustment date.
