13 EXCLUDED FROM THIS ARTICLE
14 Unless the context otherwise requires, this article applies to transactions in
15 goods; it does not apply to any transaction which although in the form of an
16 unconditional contract to sell or present sale is intended to operate only as a
17 security transaction nor does this article impair or repeal any statute regulating
18 sales to consumers, farmers or other specified classes of buyers.
19 (a) Unless the context otherwise requires, and except as provided in
20 subsection (c) of this section, this article applies to transactions in goods and,

2 (b) In a hybrid transaction:
3 (1) If the sale-of-goods aspects do not predominate, only the provisions
4 of this article which relate primarily to the sale-of-goods aspects of the
5 transaction apply, and the provisions that relate primarily to the transaction as a
6 whole do not apply.
7 (2) If the sale-of-goods aspects predominate, this article applies to the
8 transaction but does not preclude application in appropriate circumstances of
9 other law to aspects of the transaction which do not relate to the sale of goods.
10 (c) This article does not:
11 (1) apply to a transaction that, even though in the form of an
12 unconditional contract to sell or present sale, operates only to create a security
13 interest; or
14 (2) impair or repeal a statute regulating sales to consumers, farmers, or
15 other specified classes of buyers.

7 § 2—201. FORMAL REQUIREMENTS; STATUTE OF FRAUDS
8 (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section a contract for the sale of
9 goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or
10 defense unless there is some writing a record sufficient to indicate that a
11 contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party
12 against whom enforcement is sought or by his the party’s authorized agent or
13 broker. A writing record is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly
14 states a term agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under this
15 paragraph subsection beyond the quantity of goods shown in such writing the
16 record.
17 (2) Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing record in
18 confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and
19 the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the
20 requirements of subsection (1) against such the party unless written notice in a

17 offer to buy or sell goods does not constitute the writing record a sealed

15 bank, transmitted orally, electronically, or in writing or in a record, to pay, or

20 (ii) the receiving bank is to be reimbursed by debiting an account of,

VT LEG #383188 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.206
2025 Page 19 of 125
1 (iii) the instruction is transmitted by the sender directly to the
2 receiving bank or to an agent, funds-transfer system, or communication system
3 for transmittal to the receiving bank.
4 * * *
5 § 4A—201. SECURITY PROCEDURE
6 “Security procedure” means a procedure established by agreement of a
7 customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of (i) verifying that a payment
8 order or communication amending or cancelling a payment order is that of the
9 customer, or (ii) detecting error in the transmission or the content of the
10 payment order or communication. A security procedure may impose an
11 obligation on the receiving bank or the customer and may require the use of
12 algorithms or other codes, identifying words or, numbers, symbols, sounds,
13 biometrics, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices.
14 Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an
15 authorized specimen signature of the customer or requiring a payment order to
16 be sent from a known email address, IP address, or telephone number is not by
17 itself a security procedure.
18 § 4A—202. AUTHORIZED AND VERIFIED PAYMENT ORDERS
19 * * *
20 (b) If a bank and its customer have agreed that the authenticity of payment
21 orders issued to the bank in the name of the customer as sender will be verified
VT LEG #383188 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.206
2025 Page 20 of 125
1 pursuant to a security procedure, a payment order received by the receiving
2 bank is effective as the order of the customer, whether or not authorized, if (i)
3 the security procedure is a commercially reasonable method of providing
4 security against unauthorized payment orders, and (ii) the bank proves that it
5 accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance with the bank’s
6 obligations under the security procedure and any written agreement or
7 instruction of the customer, evidenced by a record, restricting acceptance of
8 payment orders issued in the name of the customer. The bank is not required
9 to follow an instruction that violates a written an agreement with the customer,
10 evidenced by a record, or notice of which is not received at a time and in a
11 manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the
12 payment order is accepted.
13 (c) Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of law
14 to be determined by considering the wishes of the customer expressed to the
15 bank, the circumstances of the customer known to the bank, including the size,
16 type, and frequency of payment orders normally issued by the customer to the
17 bank, alternative security procedures offered to the customer, and security
18 procedures in general use by customers and receiving banks similarly situated.
19 A security procedure is deemed to be commercially reasonable if (i) the
20 security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and the
21 customer refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for
VT LEG #383188 v.1

2025 Page 21 of 125
1 that customer, and (ii) the customer expressly agreed in writing a record to be
2 bound by any payment order, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and
3 accepted by the bank in compliance with the bank’s obligations under the
4 security procedure chosen by the customer.

6 § 4A—203. UNENFORCEABILITY OF CERTAIN VERIFIED PAYMENT
7 ORDERS
8 (a) If an accepted payment order is not, under subsection 4A—202(a) of
9 this title, an authorized order of a customer identified as sender, but is effective
10 as an order of the customer pursuant to subsection 4A—202(b) of this title, the
11 following rules apply:
12 (1) By express written agreement evidenced by a record, the receiving
13 bank may limit the extent to which it is entitled to enforce or retain payment of
14 the payment order.

16 § 4A—207. MISDESCRIPTION OF BENEFICIARY
17 * * *
18 (c) If (i) a payment order described in subsection (b) of this section is
19 accepted, (ii) the originator’s payment order described the beneficiary
20 inconsistently by name and number, and (iii) the beneficiary’s bank pays the

12 date; and
13 (C) remains perfected thereafter only if the requirements for

16 unperfected on the adjustment date unless the security interest becomes a
17 perfected security interest under this act before the adjustment date.
18 (2) The filing of a financing statement before July 1, 2025 is effective to

12 § 2—102. SCOPE; CERTAIN SECURITY AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS
13 EXCLUDED FROM THIS ARTICLE
14 Unless the context otherwise requires, this article applies to transactions in
15 goods; it does not apply to any transaction which although in the form of an
16 unconditional contract to sell or present sale is intended to operate only as a
17 security transaction nor does this article impair or repeal any statute regulating
18 sales to consumers, farmers or other specified classes of buyers.
19 (a) Unless the context otherwise requires, and except as provided in
20 subsection (c) of this section, this article applies to transactions in goods and,
21 in the case of a hybrid transaction, it applies to the extent provided in

2 (b) In a hybrid transaction:
3 (1) If the sale-of-goods aspects do not predominate, only the provisions
4 of this article which relate primarily to the sale-of-goods aspects of the
5 transaction apply, and the provisions that relate primarily to the transaction as a
6 whole do not apply.
7 (2) If the sale-of-goods aspects predominate, this article applies to the
8 transaction but does not preclude application in appropriate circumstances of
9 other law to aspects of the transaction which do not relate to the sale of goods.
10 (c) This article does not:
11 (1) apply to a transaction that, even though in the form of an
12 unconditional contract to sell or present sale, operates only to create a security
13 interest; or
14 (2) impair or repeal a statute regulating sales to consumers, farmers, or
15 other specified classes of buyers.

6 * * *
7 § 2—201. FORMAL REQUIREMENTS; STATUTE OF FRAUDS
8 (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section a contract for the sale of
9 goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or
10 defense unless there is some writing a record sufficient to indicate that a
11 contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party
12 against whom enforcement is sought or by his the party’s authorized agent or
13 broker. A writing record is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly
14 states a term agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under this
15 paragraph subsection beyond the quantity of goods shown in such writing the
16 record.
17 (2) Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing record in
18 confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and
19 the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the
20 requirements of subsection (1) against such the party unless written notice in a
21 record of objection to its contents is given within ten days after it is received.

5 agree or which are otherwise set forth in a writing record intended by the
6 parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as
7 are included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior
8 agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be explained or
9 supplemented:
10 (a) by course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade (§ 1—
11 303); and
12 (b) by evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the
13 writing record to have been intended also as a complete and exclusive
14 statement of the terms of the agreement.
15 § 2—203. SEALS INOPERATIVE
16 The affixing of a seal to a writing record evidencing a contract for sale or an
17 offer to buy or sell goods does not constitute the writing record a sealed
18 instrument and the law with respect to sealed instruments does not apply to
19 such a contract or offer.

13 (a) In this article:
14 (1) “Payment order” means an instruction of a sender to a receiving
15 bank, transmitted orally, electronically, or in writing or in a record, to pay, or
16 to cause another bank to pay, a fixed or determinable amount of money to a
17 beneficiary if:
18 (i) the instruction does not state a condition to payment to the
19 beneficiary other than time of payment;
20 (ii) the receiving bank is to be reimbursed by debiting an account of,
21 or otherwise receiving payment from, the sender; and
VT LEG #383188 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.206
2025 Page 19 of 125
1 (iii) the instruction is transmitted by the sender directly to the
2 receiving bank or to an agent, funds-transfer system, or communication system
3 for transmittal to the receiving bank.
4 * * *
5 § 4A—201. SECURITY PROCEDURE
6 “Security procedure” means a procedure established by agreement of a
7 customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of (i) verifying that a payment
8 order or communication amending or cancelling a payment order is that of the
9 customer, or (ii) detecting error in the transmission or the content of the
10 payment order or communication. A security procedure may impose an
11 obligation on the receiving bank or the customer and may require the use of
12 algorithms or other codes, identifying words or, numbers, symbols, sounds,
13 biometrics, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices.
14 Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an
15 authorized specimen signature of the customer or requiring a payment order to
16 be sent from a known email address, IP address, or telephone number is not by
17 itself a security procedure.
18 § 4A—202. AUTHORIZED AND VERIFIED PAYMENT ORDERS
19 * * *
20 (b) If a bank and its customer have agreed that the authenticity of payment
21 orders issued to the bank in the name of the customer as sender will be verified
VT LEG #383188 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.206
2025 Page 20 of 125
1 pursuant to a security procedure, a payment order received by the receiving
2 bank is effective as the order of the customer, whether or not authorized, if (i)
3 the security procedure is a commercially reasonable method of providing
4 security against unauthorized payment orders, and (ii) the bank proves that it
5 accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance with the bank’s
6 obligations under the security procedure and any written agreement or
7 instruction of the customer, evidenced by a record, restricting acceptance of
8 payment orders issued in the name of the customer. The bank is not required
9 to follow an instruction that violates a written an agreement with the customer,
10 evidenced by a record, or notice of which is not received at a time and in a
11 manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the
12 payment order is accepted.
13 (c) Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of law
14 to be determined by considering the wishes of the customer expressed to the
15 bank, the circumstances of the customer known to the bank, including the size,
16 type, and frequency of payment orders normally issued by the customer to the
17 bank, alternative security procedures offered to the customer, and security
18 procedures in general use by customers and receiving banks similarly situated.
19 A security procedure is deemed to be commercially reasonable if (i) the
20 security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and the
21 customer refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for
VT LEG #383188 v.1

1 that customer, and (ii) the customer expressly agreed in writing a record to be
2 bound by any payment order, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and
3 accepted by the bank in compliance with the bank’s obligations under the
4 security procedure chosen by the customer.

6 § 4A—203. UNENFORCEABILITY OF CERTAIN VERIFIED PAYMENT
7 ORDERS
8 (a) If an accepted payment order is not, under subsection 4A—202(a) of
9 this title, an authorized order of a customer identified as sender, but is effective
10 as an order of the customer pursuant to subsection 4A—202(b) of this title, the
11 following rules apply:
12 (1) By express written agreement evidenced by a record, the receiving
13 bank may limit the extent to which it is entitled to enforce or retain payment of
14 the payment order.

16 § 4A—207. MISDESCRIPTION OF BENEFICIARY
17 * * *
18 (c) If (i) a payment order described in subsection (b) of this section is
19 accepted, (ii) the originator’s payment order described the beneficiary
20 inconsistently by name and number, and (iii) the beneficiary’s bank pays the
VT LEG #383188 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.206
2025 Page 22 of 125
1 person identified by number as permitted by subdivision (b)(1) of this section,
2 the following rules apply:
3 (1) If the originator is a bank, the originator is obliged to pay its order.
4 (2) If the originator is not a bank and proves that the person identified
5 by number was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the
6 originator is not obliged to pay its order unless the originator’s bank proves
7 that the originator, before acceptance of the originator’s order, had notice that
8 payment of a payment order issued by the originator might be made by the
9 beneficiary’s bank on the basis of an identifying or bank account number even
10 if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. Proof of notice
11 may be made by any admissible evidence. The originator’s bank satisfies the
12 burden of proof if it proves that the originator, before the payment order was
13 accepted, signed a writing record stating the information to which the notice
14 relates.
15 * * *
16 § 4A—208. MISDESCRIPTION OF INTERMEDIARY BANK OR
17 BENEFICIARY’S BANK
18 * * *
19 (b) This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary
20 bank or the beneficiary’s bank both by name and an identifying number if the
21 name and number identify different persons.
VT LEG #383188 v.1

2 (2) If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank proves that the
3 sender, before the payment order was accepted, had notice that the receiving
4 bank might rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary
5 or beneficiary’s bank even if it identifies a person different from the bank
6 identified by name, the rights and obligations of the sender and the receiving
7 bank are governed by subdivision (1) of this subsection, as though the sender
8 were a bank. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The
9 receiving bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the sender, before
10 the payment order was accepted, signed a writing record stating the
11 information to which the notice relates.
12 * * *
13 § 4A—210. REJECTION OF PAYMENT ORDER
14 (a) A payment order is rejected by the receiving bank by a notice of
15 rejection transmitted to the sender orally, electronically, or in writing a record.
16 A notice of rejection need not use any particular words and is sufficient if it
17 indicates that the receiving bank is rejecting the order or will not execute or
18 pay the order. Rejection is effective when the notice is given if transmission is
19 by a means that is reasonable in the circumstances. If notice of rejection is
20 given by a means that is not reasonable, rejection is effective when the notice
21 is received. If an agreement of the sender and receiving bank establishes the

2 agreement is reasonable and (ii) any means not complying is not reasonable

4 noncomplying means.
5 * * *
6 § 4A—211. CANCELLATION AND AMENDMENT OF PAYMENT
7 ORDER
8 (a) A communication of the sender of a payment order cancelling or
9 amending the order may be transmitted to the receiving bank orally,
10 electronically, or in writing a record. If a security procedure is in effect
11 between the sender and the receiving bank, the communication is not effective
12 to cancel or amend the order unless the communication is verified pursuant to
13 the security procedure or the bank agrees to the cancellation or amendment.

16 FAILURE TO EXECUTE PAYMENT ORDER

18 (c) In addition to the amounts payable under subsections (a) and (b) of this

2025 Page 121 of 125
1 (B) Except as provided in subsections (c)—(g) of this section,
2 Article 9 as amended by this act and Article 12 apply to a transaction, lien, or

4 into, created, or acquired before July 1, 2025.
5 (2) Except as provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection and
6 subsections (c)–(g) of this section:
7 (A) a transaction, lien, or interest in property that was validly entered
8 into, created, or transferred before July 1, 2025 and was not governed by the
9 Uniform Commercial Code, but would be subject to Article 9 as amended by
10 this act or Article 12 if it had been entered into, created, or transferred on or
11 after July 1, 2025, including the rights, duties, and interests flowing from the
12 transaction, lien, or interest, remains valid on and after July 1, 2025; and
13 (B) the transaction, lien, or interest may be terminated, completed,
14 consummated, and enforced as required or permitted by this act or by the law

16 (3) This act does not affect an action, case, or proceeding commenced
17 before July 1, 2025.
18 (c) Security interest perfected before effective date.
19 (1) A security interest that is enforceable and perfected immediately

VT LEG #383188 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.206
2025 Page 122 of 125
1 2025, the requirements for enforceability and perfection under this act are
2 satisfied without further action.
3 (2) If a security interest is enforceable and perfected immediately before
4 July 1, 2025, but the requirements for enforceability or perfection under this
5 act are not satisfied on July 1, 2025, the security interest:
6 (A) is a perfected security interest until the earlier of the time
7 perfection would have ceased under the law in effect immediately before July
8 1, 2025 or the adjustment date;
9 (B) remains enforceable thereafter only if the security interest
10 satisfies the requirements for enforceability under section 9—203 of the
11 Uniform Commercial Code, as amended by this act, before the adjustment
12 date; and
13 (C) remains perfected thereafter only if the requirements for
14 perfection under this act are satisfied before the time specified in subdivision
15 (A) of this subdivision (c)(2).
16 (d) Security interest unperfected before effective date. A security interest
17 that is enforceable immediately before July 1, 2025 but is unperfected at that
18 time:
VT LEG #383188 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.206
2025 Page 123 of 125
1 (1) remains an enforceable security interest until the adjustment date;
2 (2) remains enforceable thereafter if the security interest becomes
3 enforceable under section 9—203 of the Uniform Commercial Code, as
4 amended by this act, on or before the adjustment date; and
5 (3) becomes perfected:
6 (A) without further action, on July 1, 2025 if the requirements for
7 perfection under this act are satisfied before or at that time; or
8 (B) when the requirements for perfection are satisfied if the
9 requirements are satisfied after that time.
10 (e) Effectiveness of actions taken before effective date.
11 (1) If action, other than the filing of a financing statement, is taken
12 before July 1, 2025 and the action would have resulted in perfection of the
13 security interest had the security interest become enforceable before July 1,
14 2025, the action is effective to perfect a security interest that attaches under
15 this act before the adjustment date. An attached security interest becomes
16 unperfected on the adjustment date unless the security interest becomes a
17 perfected security interest under this act before the adjustment date.
18 (2) The filing of a financing statement before July 1, 2025 is effective to
19 perfect a security interest on July 1, 2025 to the extent the filing would satisfy
20 the requirements for perfection under this act.
VT LEG #383188 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.206
2025 Page 124 of 125
1 (3) The taking of an action before July 1, 2025 is sufficient for the
2 enforceability of a security interest on July 1, 2025 if the action would satisfy
3 the requirements for enforceability under this act.
4 (f) Priority.
5 (1) Subject to subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection, this act
6 determines the priority of conflicting claims to collateral.
7 (2) Subject to subdivision (3) of this subsection, if the priorities of
8 claims to collateral were established before July 1, 2025, Article 9 as in effect
9 before July 1, 2025 determines priority.
10 (3) On the adjustment date, to the extent the priorities determined by
11 Article 9 as amended by this act modify the priorities established before July 1,
12 2025, the priorities of claims to Article 12 property and electronic money
13 established before July 1, 2025 cease to apply.
14 (g) Priority of claims when priority rules of Article 9 do not apply.
15 (1) Subject to subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection, Article 12
16 determines the priority of conflicting claims to Article 12 property when the
17 priority rules of Article 9 as amended by this act do not apply.
18 (2) Subject to subdivision (3) of this subsection, when the priority rules
19 of Article 9 as amended by this act do not apply and the priorities of claims to
20 Article 12 property were established before July 1, 2025, law other than Article
21 12 determines priority.
VT LEG #383188 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.206
2025 Page 125 of 125
1 (3) When the priority rules of Article 9 as amended by this act do not
2 apply, to the extent the priorities determined by this act modify the priorities
3 established before July 1, 2025, the priorities of claims to Article 12 property
4 established before July 1, 2025 cease to apply on the adjustment date.
