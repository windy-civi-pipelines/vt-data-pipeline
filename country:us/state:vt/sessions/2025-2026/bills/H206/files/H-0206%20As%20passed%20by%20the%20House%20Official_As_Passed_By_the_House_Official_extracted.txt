1 Unless the context otherwise requires, this article applies to transactions in
2 goods; it does not apply to any transaction which although in the form of an

12 of this article which relate primarily to the sale-of-goods aspects of the
13 transaction apply, and the provisions that relate primarily to the transaction as

15 (2) If the sale-of-goods aspects predominate, this article applies to the
16 transaction but does not preclude application in appropriate circumstances of
17 other law to aspects of the transaction which do not relate to the sale of goods.
18 (c) This article does not:
19 (1) apply to a transaction that, even though in the form of an

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.206
2025 Page 19 of 124
1 (i) the instruction does not state a condition to payment to the
2 beneficiary other than time of payment;
3 (ii) the receiving bank is to be reimbursed by debiting an account of,
4 or otherwise receiving payment from, the sender; and
5 (iii) the instruction is transmitted by the sender directly to the
6 receiving bank or to an agent, funds-transfer system, or communication system
7 for transmittal to the receiving bank.
8 * * *
9 § 4A—201. SECURITY PROCEDURE
10 “Security procedure” means a procedure established by agreement of a
11 customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of (i) verifying that a payment
12 order or communication amending or cancelling a payment order is that of the
13 customer, or (ii) detecting error in the transmission or the content of the
14 payment order or communication. A security procedure may impose an
15 obligation on the receiving bank or the customer and may require the use of
16 algorithms or other codes, identifying words or, numbers, symbols, sounds,
17 biometrics, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices.
18 Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an
19 authorized specimen signature of the customer or requiring a payment order to
20 be sent from a known email address, IP address, or telephone number is not by
21 itself a security procedure.

1 § 4A—202. AUTHORIZED AND VERIFIED PAYMENT ORDERS
2 * * *
3 (b) If a bank and its customer have agreed that the authenticity of payment
4 orders issued to the bank in the name of the customer as sender will be verified
5 pursuant to a security procedure, a payment order received by the receiving
6 bank is effective as the order of the customer, whether or not authorized, if (i)
7 the security procedure is a commercially reasonable method of providing
8 security against unauthorized payment orders, and (ii) the bank proves that it
9 accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance with the bank’s
10 obligations under the security procedure and any written agreement or
11 instruction of the customer, evidenced by a record, restricting acceptance of
12 payment orders issued in the name of the customer. The bank is not required
13 to follow an instruction that violates a written an agreement with the customer,
14 evidenced by a record, or notice of which is not received at a time and in a
15 manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the
16 payment order is accepted.
17 (c) Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of law
18 to be determined by considering the wishes of the customer expressed to the
19 bank, the circumstances of the customer known to the bank, including the size,
20 type, and frequency of payment orders normally issued by the customer to the
21 bank, alternative security procedures offered to the customer, and security
BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.206
2025 Page 21 of 124
1 procedures in general use by customers and receiving banks similarly situated.
2 A security procedure is deemed to be commercially reasonable if (i) the
3 security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and the
4 customer refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for
5 that customer, and (ii) the customer expressly agreed in writing a record to be
6 bound by any payment order, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and
7 accepted by the bank in compliance with the bank’s obligations under the
8 security procedure chosen by the customer.
9 * * *
10 § 4A—203. UNENFORCEABILITY OF CERTAIN VERIFIED PAYMENT
11 ORDERS
12 (a) If an accepted payment order is not, under subsection 4A—202(a) of
13 this title, an authorized order of a customer identified as sender, but is effective
14 as an order of the customer pursuant to subsection 4A—202(b) of this title, the
15 following rules apply:
16 (1) By express written agreement evidenced by a record, the receiving
17 bank may limit the extent to which it is entitled to enforce or retain payment of
18 the payment order.

1 (c) If (i) a payment order described in subsection (b) of this section is
2 accepted, (ii) the originator’s payment order described the beneficiary
3 inconsistently by name and number, and (iii) the beneficiary’s bank pays the
4 person identified by number as permitted by subdivision (b)(1) of this section,
5 the following rules apply:
6 (1) If the originator is a bank, the originator is obliged to pay its order.
7 (2) If the originator is not a bank and proves that the person identified
8 by number was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the
9 originator is not obliged to pay its order unless the originator’s bank proves
10 that the originator, before acceptance of the originator’s order, had notice that
11 payment of a payment order issued by the originator might be made by the
12 beneficiary’s bank on the basis of an identifying or bank account number even
13 if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. Proof of notice
14 may be made by any admissible evidence. The originator’s bank satisfies the
15 burden of proof if it proves that the originator, before the payment order was
16 accepted, signed a writing record stating the information to which the notice
17 relates.

1 (b) This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary
2 bank or the beneficiary’s bank both by name and an identifying number if the
3 name and number identify different persons.
4 * * *
5 (2) If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank proves that the
6 sender, before the payment order was accepted, had notice that the receiving
7 bank might rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary
8 or beneficiary’s bank even if it identifies a person different from the bank
9 identified by name, the rights and obligations of the sender and the receiving
10 bank are governed by subdivision (1) of this subsection, as though the sender
11 were a bank. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The
12 receiving bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the sender, before
13 the payment order was accepted, signed a writing record stating the

16 § 4A—210. REJECTION OF PAYMENT ORDER
17 (a) A payment order is rejected by the receiving bank by a notice of
18 rejection transmitted to the sender orally, electronically, or in writing a record.
19 A notice of rejection need not use any particular words and is sufficient if it
20 indicates that the receiving bank is rejecting the order or will not execute or
21 pay the order. Rejection is effective when the notice is given if transmission is

2025 Page 24 of 124
1 by a means that is reasonable in the circumstances. If notice of rejection is
2 given by a means that is not reasonable, rejection is effective when the notice
3 is received. If an agreement of the sender and receiving bank establishes the
4 means to be used to reject a payment order, (i) any means complying with the
5 agreement is reasonable and (ii) any means not complying is not reasonable
6 unless no significant delay in receipt of the notice resulted from the use of the
7 noncomplying means.

9 § 4A—211. CANCELLATION AND AMENDMENT OF PAYMENT
10 ORDER
11 (a) A communication of the sender of a payment order cancelling or
12 amending the order may be transmitted to the receiving bank orally,
13 electronically, or in writing a record. If a security procedure is in effect
14 between the sender and the receiving bank, the communication is not effective

1 of this title unless an effective agreement determines that the local law of
2 another jurisdiction governs.
3 (c) The following rules determine a controllable electronic record’s
4 jurisdiction under this section:
5 (1) If the controllable electronic record, or a record attached to or
6 logically associated with the controllable electronic record and readily
7 available for review, expressly provides that a particular jurisdiction is the
8 controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction for purposes of this article or title,
9 that jurisdiction is the controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction.
10 (2) If subdivision (1) of this subsection does not apply and the rules of
11 the system in which the controllable electronic record is recorded are readily
12 available for review and expressly provide that a particular jurisdiction is the
13 controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction for purposes of this article or title,
14 that jurisdiction is the controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction.

1 (4) If subdivisions (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection do not apply and
2 the rules of the system in which the controllable electronic record is recorded
3 are readily available for review and expressly provide that the controllable
4 electronic record or the system is governed by the law of a particular
5 jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction.
6 (5) If subdivisions (1)–(4) of this subsection do not apply, the
7 controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction is the District of Columbia.
8 (d) If subdivision (5) of subsection (c) of this section applies and Article 12
9 is not in effect in the District of Columbia without material modification, the

12 without material modification. In this subsection, “Article 12” means Article
13 12 of Uniform Commercial Code Amendments (2022).
14 (e) To the extent subsections (a) and (b) of this section provide that the

16 covered by this article, that law governs even if the matter or a transaction to
17 which the matter relates does not bear any relation to the controllable
18 electronic record’s jurisdiction.

20 qualifying purchaser are governed by the law applicable under this section at
21 the time of purchase.

18 perfection would have ceased under the law in effect immediately before July
19 1, 2025 or the adjustment date;

6 perfect a security interest on July 1, 2025 to the extent the filing would satisfy

9 apply, to the extent the priorities determined by this act modify the priorities

17 other law to aspects of the transaction which do not relate to the sale of goods.
18 (c) This article does not:

19 bank, transmitted orally, electronically, or in writing or in a record, to pay, or

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.206
2025 Page 19 of 124
1 (i) the instruction does not state a condition to payment to the
2 beneficiary other than time of payment;
3 (ii) the receiving bank is to be reimbursed by debiting an account of,
4 or otherwise receiving payment from, the sender; and
5 (iii) the instruction is transmitted by the sender directly to the
6 receiving bank or to an agent, funds-transfer system, or communication system
7 for transmittal to the receiving bank.
8 * * *
9 § 4A—201. SECURITY PROCEDURE
10 “Security procedure” means a procedure established by agreement of a
11 customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of (i) verifying that a payment
12 order or communication amending or cancelling a payment order is that of the
13 customer, or (ii) detecting error in the transmission or the content of the
14 payment order or communication. A security procedure may impose an
15 obligation on the receiving bank or the customer and may require the use of
16 algorithms or other codes, identifying words or, numbers, symbols, sounds,
17 biometrics, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices.
18 Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an
19 authorized specimen signature of the customer or requiring a payment order to
20 be sent from a known email address, IP address, or telephone number is not by
21 itself a security procedure.

1 § 4A—202. AUTHORIZED AND VERIFIED PAYMENT ORDERS
2 * * *
3 (b) If a bank and its customer have agreed that the authenticity of payment
4 orders issued to the bank in the name of the customer as sender will be verified
5 pursuant to a security procedure, a payment order received by the receiving
6 bank is effective as the order of the customer, whether or not authorized, if (i)
7 the security procedure is a commercially reasonable method of providing
8 security against unauthorized payment orders, and (ii) the bank proves that it
9 accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance with the bank’s
10 obligations under the security procedure and any written agreement or
11 instruction of the customer, evidenced by a record, restricting acceptance of
12 payment orders issued in the name of the customer. The bank is not required
13 to follow an instruction that violates a written an agreement with the customer,
14 evidenced by a record, or notice of which is not received at a time and in a
15 manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the
16 payment order is accepted.
17 (c) Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of law
18 to be determined by considering the wishes of the customer expressed to the
19 bank, the circumstances of the customer known to the bank, including the size,
20 type, and frequency of payment orders normally issued by the customer to the
21 bank, alternative security procedures offered to the customer, and security

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.206
2025 Page 21 of 124
1 procedures in general use by customers and receiving banks similarly situated.
2 A security procedure is deemed to be commercially reasonable if (i) the
3 security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and the
4 customer refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for
5 that customer, and (ii) the customer expressly agreed in writing a record to be
6 bound by any payment order, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and
7 accepted by the bank in compliance with the bank’s obligations under the
8 security procedure chosen by the customer.
9 * * *
10 § 4A—203. UNENFORCEABILITY OF CERTAIN VERIFIED PAYMENT
11 ORDERS
12 (a) If an accepted payment order is not, under subsection 4A—202(a) of
13 this title, an authorized order of a customer identified as sender, but is effective
14 as an order of the customer pursuant to subsection 4A—202(b) of this title, the
15 following rules apply:
16 (1) By express written agreement evidenced by a record, the receiving
17 bank may limit the extent to which it is entitled to enforce or retain payment of
18 the payment order.

2 accepted, (ii) the originator’s payment order described the beneficiary
3 inconsistently by name and number, and (iii) the beneficiary’s bank pays the
4 person identified by number as permitted by subdivision (b)(1) of this section,
5 the following rules apply:
6 (1) If the originator is a bank, the originator is obliged to pay its order.
7 (2) If the originator is not a bank and proves that the person identified
8 by number was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the
9 originator is not obliged to pay its order unless the originator’s bank proves
10 that the originator, before acceptance of the originator’s order, had notice that
11 payment of a payment order issued by the originator might be made by the
12 beneficiary’s bank on the basis of an identifying or bank account number even
13 if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. Proof of notice
14 may be made by any admissible evidence. The originator’s bank satisfies the
15 burden of proof if it proves that the originator, before the payment order was
16 accepted, signed a writing record stating the information to which the notice
17 relates.

1 (b) This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary
2 bank or the beneficiary’s bank both by name and an identifying number if the
3 name and number identify different persons.
4 * * *
5 (2) If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank proves that the
6 sender, before the payment order was accepted, had notice that the receiving
7 bank might rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary
8 or beneficiary’s bank even if it identifies a person different from the bank
9 identified by name, the rights and obligations of the sender and the receiving
10 bank are governed by subdivision (1) of this subsection, as though the sender
11 were a bank. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The
12 receiving bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the sender, before
13 the payment order was accepted, signed a writing record stating the
14 information to which the notice relates.
15 * * *
16 § 4A—210. REJECTION OF PAYMENT ORDER
17 (a) A payment order is rejected by the receiving bank by a notice of
18 rejection transmitted to the sender orally, electronically, or in writing a record.
19 A notice of rejection need not use any particular words and is sufficient if it
20 indicates that the receiving bank is rejecting the order or will not execute or
21 pay the order. Rejection is effective when the notice is given if transmission is

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.206
2025 Page 24 of 124
1 by a means that is reasonable in the circumstances. If notice of rejection is
2 given by a means that is not reasonable, rejection is effective when the notice
3 is received. If an agreement of the sender and receiving bank establishes the
4 means to be used to reject a payment order, (i) any means complying with the
5 agreement is reasonable and (ii) any means not complying is not reasonable
6 unless no significant delay in receipt of the notice resulted from the use of the
7 noncomplying means.

11 (a) A communication of the sender of a payment order cancelling or

13 electronically, or in writing a record. If a security procedure is in effect
14 between the sender and the receiving bank, the communication is not effective
15 to cancel or amend the order unless the communication is verified pursuant to
16 the security procedure or the bank agrees to the cancellation or amendment.

3 extent provided in an express written agreement of the receiving bank,
4 evidenced by a record.
5 (d) If a receiving bank fails to execute a payment order it was obliged by
6 express agreement to execute, the receiving bank is liable to the sender for its
7 expenses in the transaction and for incidental expenses and interest losses
8 resulting from the failure to execute. Additional damages, including

7 whose law is chosen need not bear any relation to the transaction.
8 (b) Unless subsection (a) of this section applies, the liability of an issuer,
9 nominated person, or adviser for action or omission is governed by the law of
10 the jurisdiction in which the person is located. The person is considered to be

10 (C) pay any part of a payment by more than one method or to more

1 of this title unless an effective agreement determines that the local law of
2 another jurisdiction governs.
3 (c) The following rules determine a controllable electronic record’s
4 jurisdiction under this section:
5 (1) If the controllable electronic record, or a record attached to or
6 logically associated with the controllable electronic record and readily
7 available for review, expressly provides that a particular jurisdiction is the
8 controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction for purposes of this article or title,
9 that jurisdiction is the controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction.
10 (2) If subdivision (1) of this subsection does not apply and the rules of
11 the system in which the controllable electronic record is recorded are readily
12 available for review and expressly provide that a particular jurisdiction is the
13 controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction for purposes of this article or title,
14 that jurisdiction is the controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction.
15 (3) If subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection do not apply and the
16 controllable electronic record, or a record attached to or logically associated

1 (4) If subdivisions (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection do not apply and
2 the rules of the system in which the controllable electronic record is recorded
3 are readily available for review and expressly provide that the controllable
4 electronic record or the system is governed by the law of a particular
5 jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction.
6 (5) If subdivisions (1)–(4) of this subsection do not apply, the
7 controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction is the District of Columbia.
8 (d) If subdivision (5) of subsection (c) of this section applies and Article 12
9 is not in effect in the District of Columbia without material modification, the
10 governing law for a matter covered by this article is the law of the District of
11 Columbia as though Article 12 were in effect in the District of Columbia
12 without material modification. In this subsection, “Article 12” means Article
13 12 of Uniform Commercial Code Amendments (2022).
14 (e) To the extent subsections (a) and (b) of this section provide that the
15 local law of the controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction governs a matter
16 covered by this article, that law governs even if the matter or a transaction to
17 which the matter relates does not bear any relation to the controllable
18 electronic record’s jurisdiction.

20 qualifying purchaser are governed by the law applicable under this section at
21 the time of purchase.

2025 Page 121 of 124
1 this act or Article 12 if it had been entered into, created, or transferred on or

8 before July 1, 2025.
9 (c) Security interest perfected before effective date.
10 (1) A security interest that is enforceable and perfected immediately

18 perfection would have ceased under the law in effect immediately before July
19 1, 2025 or the adjustment date;
20 (B) remains enforceable thereafter only if the security interest
21 satisfies the requirements for enforceability under section 9—203 of the

2025 Page 122 of 124
1 Uniform Commercial Code, as amended by this act, before the adjustment

3 (C) remains perfected thereafter only if the requirements for
4 perfection under this act are satisfied before the time specified in subdivision

2025 Page 123 of 124
1 2025, the action is effective to perfect a security interest that attaches under

3 unperfected on the adjustment date unless the security interest becomes a
4 perfected security interest under this act before the adjustment date.
5 (2) The filing of a financing statement before July 1, 2025 is effective to
6 perfect a security interest on July 1, 2025 to the extent the filing would satisfy
7 the requirements for perfection under this act.

5 of Article 9 as amended by this act do not apply and the priorities of claims to
6 Article 12 property were established before July 1, 2025, law other than
7 Article 12 determines priority.
8 (3) When the priority rules of Article 9 as amended by this act do not
9 apply, to the extent the priorities determined by this act modify the priorities
10 established before July 1, 2025, the priorities of claims to Article 12 property
