other law to aspects of the transaction which do not relate to the sale of goods.
(c) This article does not:

interest; or

goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or

2025
defense unless there is some writing a record sufficient to indicate that a
contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party
against whom enforcement is sought or by his the party’s authorized agent or
broker. A writing record is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly
states a term agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under this
paragraph subsection beyond the quantity of goods shown in such writing the
record.
(2) Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing record in
confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and
the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the

primarily to the transaction as a whole do not apply;
(ii) section 2A—209 of this title applies if the lease is a finance
lease; and

reasonably identifies what is described.

striking out of the party’s signature, or the addition of words to the instrument
indicating discharge, or (ii) by agreeing not to sue or otherwise renouncing

Sec. 5. 9A V.S.A. article 4A is amended to read:
ARTICLE 4A. FUNDS TRANSFERS
* * *
§ 4A—103. PAYMENT ORDER—DEFINITIONS
(a) In this article:
(1) “Payment order” means an instruction of a sender to a receiving
bank, transmitted orally, electronically, or in writing or in a record, to pay, or
to cause another bank to pay, a fixed or determinable amount of money to a
beneficiary if:
(i) the instruction does not state a condition to payment to the
beneficiary other than time of payment;
(ii) the receiving bank is to be reimbursed by debiting an account of,
or otherwise receiving payment from, the sender; and
(iii) the instruction is transmitted by the sender directly to the
receiving bank or to an agent, funds-transfer system, or communication system
for transmittal to the receiving bank.
* * *
§ 4A—201. SECURITY PROCEDURE
“Security procedure” means a procedure established by agreement of a
customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of (i) verifying that a payment
order or communication amending or cancelling a payment order is that of the
customer, or (ii) detecting error in the transmission or the content of the
VT LEG #383691 v.1

No. 17 Page 18 of 118
2025
payment order or communication. A security procedure may impose an
obligation on the receiving bank or the customer and may require the use of
algorithms or other codes, identifying words or, numbers, symbols, sounds,
biometrics, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices.
Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an
authorized specimen signature of the customer or requiring a payment order to
be sent from a known email address, IP address, or telephone number is not by
itself a security procedure.
§ 4A—202. AUTHORIZED AND VERIFIED PAYMENT ORDERS
* * *
(b) If a bank and its customer have agreed that the authenticity of payment
orders issued to the bank in the name of the customer as sender will be verified
pursuant to a security procedure, a payment order received by the receiving
bank is effective as the order of the customer, whether or not authorized, if (i)
the security procedure is a commercially reasonable method of providing
security against unauthorized payment orders, and (ii) the bank proves that it
accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance with the bank’s
obligations under the security procedure and any written agreement or
instruction of the customer, evidenced by a record, restricting acceptance of
payment orders issued in the name of the customer. The bank is not required
to follow an instruction that violates a written an agreement with the customer,
evidenced by a record, or notice of which is not received at a time and in a
VT LEG #383691 v.1

No. 17 Page 19 of 118
2025
manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the
payment order is accepted.
(c) Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of law
to be determined by considering the wishes of the customer expressed to the
bank, the circumstances of the customer known to the bank, including the size,
type, and frequency of payment orders normally issued by the customer to the
bank, alternative security procedures offered to the customer, and security
procedures in general use by customers and receiving banks similarly situated.
A security procedure is deemed to be commercially reasonable if (i) the
security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and the
customer refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for
that customer, and (ii) the customer expressly agreed in writing a record to be
bound by any payment order, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and
accepted by the bank in compliance with the bank’s obligations under the
security procedure chosen by the customer.
* * *
§ 4A—203. UNENFORCEABILITY OF CERTAIN VERIFIED PAYMENT
ORDERS
(a) If an accepted payment order is not, under subsection 4A—202(a) of
this title, an authorized order of a customer identified as sender, but is effective
as an order of the customer pursuant to subsection 4A—202(b) of this title, the
following rules apply:
VT LEG #383691 v.1

No. 17 Page 20 of 118
2025
(1) By express written agreement evidenced by a record, the receiving
bank may limit the extent to which it is entitled to enforce or retain payment of
the payment order.
* * *
§ 4A—207. MISDESCRIPTION OF BENEFICIARY
* * *
(c) If (i) a payment order described in subsection (b) of this section is
accepted, (ii) the originator’s payment order described the beneficiary
inconsistently by name and number, and (iii) the beneficiary’s bank pays the
person identified by number as permitted by subdivision (b)(1) of this section,
the following rules apply:
(1) If the originator is a bank, the originator is obliged to pay its order.
(2) If the originator is not a bank and proves that the person identified
by number was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the
originator is not obliged to pay its order unless the originator’s bank proves
that the originator, before acceptance of the originator’s order, had notice that
payment of a payment order issued by the originator might be made by the
beneficiary’s bank on the basis of an identifying or bank account number even
if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. Proof of notice
may be made by any admissible evidence. The originator’s bank satisfies the
burden of proof if it proves that the originator, before the payment order was
VT LEG #383691 v.1

No. 17 Page 21 of 118
2025
accepted, signed a writing record stating the information to which the notice
relates.
* * *
§ 4A—208. MISDESCRIPTION OF INTERMEDIARY BANK OR
BENEFICIARY’S BANK
* * *
(b) This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary
bank or the beneficiary’s bank both by name and an identifying number if the
name and number identify different persons.
* * *
(2) If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank proves that the
sender, before the payment order was accepted, had notice that the receiving
bank might rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary
or beneficiary’s bank even if it identifies a person different from the bank
identified by name, the rights and obligations of the sender and the receiving
bank are governed by subdivision (1) of this subsection, as though the sender
were a bank. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The
receiving bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the sender, before
the payment order was accepted, signed a writing record stating the
information to which the notice relates.
* * *
§ 4A—210. REJECTION OF PAYMENT ORDER
VT LEG #383691 v.1

No. 17 Page 22 of 118
2025
(a) A payment order is rejected by the receiving bank by a notice of
rejection transmitted to the sender orally, electronically, or in writing a record.
A notice of rejection need not use any particular words and is sufficient if it
indicates that the receiving bank is rejecting the order or will not execute or
pay the order. Rejection is effective when the notice is given if transmission is
by a means that is reasonable in the circumstances. If notice of rejection is
given by a means that is not reasonable, rejection is effective when the notice
is received. If an agreement of the sender and receiving bank establishes the
means to be used to reject a payment order, (i) any means complying with the
agreement is reasonable and (ii) any means not complying is not reasonable
unless no significant delay in receipt of the notice resulted from the use of the
noncomplying means.
* * *
§ 4A—211. CANCELLATION AND AMENDMENT OF PAYMENT
ORDER
(a) A communication of the sender of a payment order cancelling or
amending the order may be transmitted to the receiving bank orally,
electronically, or in writing a record. If a security procedure is in effect
between the sender and the receiving bank, the communication is not effective
to cancel or amend the order unless the communication is verified pursuant to
the security procedure or the bank agrees to the cancellation or amendment.

FAILURE TO EXECUTE PAYMENT ORDER
* * *
(c) In addition to the amounts payable under subsections (a) and (b) of this
section, damages, including consequential damages, are recoverable to the
extent provided in an express written agreement of the receiving bank,
evidenced by a record.
(d) If a receiving bank fails to execute a payment order it was obliged by
express agreement to execute, the receiving bank is liable to the sender for its
expenses in the transaction and for incidental expenses and interest losses
resulting from the failure to execute. Additional damages, including
consequential damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in an express
written agreement of the receiving bank, evidenced by a record, but are not
otherwise recoverable.

signature or (ii) in accordance with the agreement of the parties or the standard
practice referred to in subsection 5—108(e) of this title.
* * *
§ 5—116. CHOICE OF LAW AND FORUM
(a) The liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser for action or
omission is governed by the law of the jurisdiction chosen by an agreement in
the form of a record signed or otherwise authenticated by the affected parties in
the manner provided in section 5—104 of this title or by a provision in the
person’s letter of credit, confirmation, or other undertaking. The jurisdiction
whose law is chosen need not bear any relation to the transaction.
(b) Unless subsection (a) of this section applies, the liability of an issuer,

purchaser and qualifying purchaser, in the same manner this section applies to
a controllable electronic record.

obtains control of the account or payment intangible if it obtains control of the
controllable electronic record that evidences the account or payment
intangible.
(c) Except as provided in this section, law other than this article determines
whether a person acquires a right in a controllable electronic record and the
right the person acquires.

(A) power to avail itself of substantially all the benefit from the
electronic record; and

(i) prevent others from availing themselves of substantially all the
benefit from the electronic record; and

record is recorded limits the use of the electronic record or has a protocol
programmed to cause a change, including a transfer or loss of control or a
modification of benefits afforded by the electronic record; or
(2) the power is shared with another person.
(c) A power of a person is not shared with another person under

by the other person; and
(2) the other person:
(A) can exercise the power without exercise of the power by the
person; or
(B) is the transferor to the person of an interest in the controllable
electronic record or a controllable account or controllable payment intangible

VT LEG #383691 v.1

No. 17 Page 106 of 118

§ 12—106. DISCHARGE OF ACCOUNT DEBTOR ON CONTROLLABLE
ACCOUNT OR CONTROLLABLE PAYMENT INTANGIBLE
(a) An account debtor on a controllable account or controllable payment
intangible may discharge its obligation by paying:

person that, at that time, had control of the controllable electronic record that
evidences the controllable account or controllable payment intangible agree in
a signed record to a commercially reasonable method by which a person may
furnish reasonable proof that control has been transferred;
(2) to the extent an agreement between the account debtor and seller of a
payment intangible limits the account debtor’s duty to pay a person other than
the seller and the limitation is effective under law other than this article; or

that formerly had control, even if the account debtor has received a notification
under subsection (b) of this section.

electronic record;
(2) prevent others from availing themselves of substantially all the

jurisdiction governs.
(c) The following rules determine a controllable electronic record’s
jurisdiction under this section:

record’s jurisdiction.
(4) If subdivisions (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection do not apply and
the rules of the system in which the controllable electronic record is recorded
are readily available for review and expressly provide that the controllable
electronic record or the system is governed by the law of a particular
jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction.
(5) If subdivisions (1)–(4) of this subsection do not apply, the
controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction is the District of Columbia.
(d) If subdivision (5) of subsection (c) of this section applies and Article 12
is not in effect in the District of Columbia without material modification, the
governing law for a matter covered by this article is the law of the District of
Columbia as though Article 12 were in effect in the District of Columbia

(B) Except as provided in subsections (c)—(g) of this section,
Article 9 as amended by this act and Article 12 apply to a transaction, lien, or
other interest in property, even if the transaction, lien, or interest was entered
into, created, or acquired before July 1, 2025.
(2) Except as provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection and
subsections (c)–(g) of this section:
(A) a transaction, lien, or interest in property that was validly entered
into, created, or transferred before July 1, 2025 and was not governed by the
Uniform Commercial Code, but would be subject to Article 9 as amended by
this act or Article 12 if it had been entered into, created, or transferred on or
after July 1, 2025, including the rights, duties, and interests flowing from the
transaction, lien, or interest, remains valid on and after July 1, 2025; and
(B) the transaction, lien, or interest may be terminated, completed,

(3) This act does not affect an action, case, or proceeding commenced
before July 1, 2025.
(c) Security interest perfected before effective date.
(1) A security interest that is enforceable and perfected immediately

satisfied without further action.
VT LEG #383691 v.1

No. 17 Page 115 of 118
2025
(2) If a security interest is enforceable and perfected immediately before
July 1, 2025, but the requirements for enforceability or perfection under this
act are not satisfied on July 1, 2025, the security interest:
(A) is a perfected security interest until the earlier of the time
perfection would have ceased under the law in effect immediately before July
1, 2025 or the adjustment date;
(B) remains enforceable thereafter only if the security interest
satisfies the requirements for enforceability under section 9—203 of the
Uniform Commercial Code, as amended by this act, before the adjustment
date; and
(C) remains perfected thereafter only if the requirements for
perfection under this act are satisfied before the time specified in subdivision
(A) of this subdivision (c)(2).
(d) Security interest unperfected before effective date. A security interest
that is enforceable immediately before July 1, 2025 but is unperfected at that
time:
(1) remains an enforceable security interest until the adjustment date;
(2) remains enforceable thereafter if the security interest becomes
enforceable under section 9—203 of the Uniform Commercial Code, as
amended by this act, on or before the adjustment date; and
(3) becomes perfected:
VT LEG #383691 v.1

No. 17 Page 116 of 118
2025

perfection under this act are satisfied before or at that time; or
(B) when the requirements for perfection are satisfied if the
requirements are satisfied after that time.
(e) Effectiveness of actions taken before effective date.
(1) If action, other than the filing of a financing statement, is taken
before July 1, 2025 and the action would have resulted in perfection of the
security interest had the security interest become enforceable before July 1,
2025, the action is effective to perfect a security interest that attaches under
this act before the adjustment date. An attached security interest becomes
unperfected on the adjustment date unless the security interest becomes a
perfected security interest under this act before the adjustment date.
(2) The filing of a financing statement before July 1, 2025 is effective to
perfect a security interest on July 1, 2025 to the extent the filing would satisfy
the requirements for perfection under this act.
(3) The taking of an action before July 1, 2025 is sufficient for the
enforceability of a security interest on July 1, 2025 if the action would satisfy
the requirements for enforceability under this act.
