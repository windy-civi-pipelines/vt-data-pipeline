House concurrent resolution congratulating the 2025 Mount Mansfield Union High School Cougars
boys’ Division I championship Nordic ski team
Whereas, throughout the two days of the 2025 Nordic championships, in the Division I boys’
competition, the Cougars were in command on the trails, both in the opening freestyle during the first
day at the Craftsbury Outdoor Center and on the second day at the Prospect Mountain Nordic Ski Center
in Woodford for the classic skiing, and
Whereas, in Craftsbury, an MMU boy placed second in the 5k race, and the team recorded the best
overall score for the day, easily surpassing Champlain Valley Union High School (CVU) 34–85, and
Whereas, when the teams reassembled at Prospect Mountain, the Cougars placed third and fifth in the
individual results and scored first in the relay, skiing past Mount Anthony (38:36.1–42:00.4), and MMU
captured the team title, outscoring CVU (67–190), and
Whereas, the Cougars who won the Division I honors were Andres Miguez, Ben Witters, Brady
Morigeau, Colin Hart, Crosby Waite, Derek Hefel, Devin Axelrod, Farmer Lindemuth, Finn Monahan,
Hayden Gilbert, Henry Hoff, Isaiah Bowen, Jack Connell, Jacob Sayre, Levi McEntee, Liam Buswell,
Liam Repp, Logan Axelrod, Luke Amidon, Matteo Dezon-Gaillard, Macs Wyatt, Roy Powers, Will
Hess, and Zell Donovan, and
Whereas, coaches Wylie Picotte, Al Sartwell, and Eden Shullenberger were all proud of the Cougar
boys, now therefore be it

That the General Assembly congratulates the 2025 Mount Mansfield Union High School Cougars
boys’ Division I championship Nordic ski team, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to MMU.
