Whereas, the Brattleboro Food Co-op was the brainchild of, among others, Lee
Crowley, Jack Fredericks, Cliff Adler, Lynn Levine, Carl Hirth, Peter Stolle, Billy
Fitzgerald, and Alex Gyori, and their initiative to start a small buying club has evolved
into a community-owned cooperative food emporium, and
Whereas, the organizers’ dream became a reality on February 20, 1975 when the
Brattleboro Food Co-op opened to the public in a small garage located at 40 High Street
in Brattleboro, a cramped facility measuring approximately 150–200 square feet, and
Whereas, the opening day’s sales tallied $600.00, a meager sum in comparison with
the latest year’s gross sales of nearly $25.5 million, and
Whereas, in 1988, the Brattleboro Food Co-op moved into a structure at the rear of the
current parking lot, and in 2012, the current beautiful four-floor building, which is a hub
of activity at 2 Main Street in downtown Brattleboro, began serving the public, and
Whereas, renovated through a collaboration with the Windham & Windsor Housing
Trust (the Trust) and Housing Vermont, the four-floor facility features a 14,580 square
foot first-floor natural foods market with a deli, the Whetstone Café, which often
welcomes live music; the organization’s offices; a commissary kitchen; a cooking
classroom; a conference room; a second-floor community room that is available for
rental; and 24 Trust-owned apartments that occupy the top floors, and
Whereas, the Brattleboro Food Co-op contains the following departments: beer and
wine; catering; cheese; deli, with Brattleboro’s largest selection of eat-in and take-out
food offerings; grocery; bulk food; meat and seafood; produce and floral, which supports
local farmers and offers floral and plant choices year-round; and health and wellness,
selling holistic products, and
Whereas, the Brattleboro Food Co-op is proud of its half-century serving Windham
County residents, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the Brattleboro Food Co-op on its 50th
anniversary and extends best future wishes, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the Brattleboro Food Co-op.
