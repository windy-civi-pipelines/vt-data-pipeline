2 Introduced by Senator Vyhovsky
3 Referred to Committee on
4 Date:
5 Subject: Education; State funding of public education; taxation and finance;
6 education property tax; education income tax; education finance
7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to transition
8 from an education property tax to an education income tax in fiscal year 2027.
9 This bill would create an education tax that is based on the income of Vermont
10 homeowners with a rate determined by locally voted budgets. This bill
11 proposes to impose the education tax on the income of all Vermont residents
12 (both homeowners and renters) in fiscal year 2030. This bill would eliminate
13 the homestead education property tax and levy the nonhomestead education
14 property tax on all property except residential dwellings and the two-acre
15 parcel surrounding the dwellings. This bill would continue to provide the
16 existing renter credit and create a new renter credit against the education
17 income tax. This bill also proposes to update the property tax credit income
18 sensitivity measures to provide relief to a broader class of Vermont taxpayers
19 in fiscal year 2026. This bill also proposes to address revenue lost due to the
20 expansion of the income sensitivity measures by creating a one-year new top
21 marginal tax rate on income.

7 average per pupil education spending and multiplying the result by the rates
8 under this section.

13 credit amount under section 6066 of this title, related to a homestead owned by
14 the claimant, based on the prior taxable year’s income and crediting municipal
15 property taxes paid in the prior year. The Commissioner shall notify the
16 municipality in which the housesite is located of the amount of the property tax
17 credit for the claimant for homestead municipal property tax liabilities on a
18 monthly basis. The tax credit of a claimant who was assessed property tax by
19 a town that revised the dates of its fiscal year, however, is the excess of the
20 municipal property tax that was assessed in the last 12 months of the revised
21 fiscal year, over the adjusted property tax of the claimant for the revised fiscal

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.104

1 year, as determined under section 6066 of this title, related to a homestead

4 determined under subsection (a) of this section, for credit to the taxpayer for
5 homestead property tax liabilities, any income tax overpayment remaining
6 after allocation under section 3112 of this title and setoff under section 5934 of

8 taxes. [Repealed.]
9 (c) The Commissioner shall notify the municipality of any claim and
10 refund amounts unresolved by November 1 at the time of final resolution,
11 including adjudication, if any; provided, however, that towns will not be
12 notified of any additional credit amounts after November 1 of the claim year,

3 tax bill, instead of the bill required under subdivision 5402(b)(1) of this title,
4 providing the total amount allocated to payment of homestead education
5 property tax liabilities and notice of the balance due. Municipalities shall
6 apply the amount allocated under this chapter to current year property taxes in
7 equal amounts to each of the taxpayers’ property tax installments that include
8 education taxes. Notwithstanding section 4772 of this title, if a town issues a
9 corrected bill as a result of the notice sent by the Commissioner under
10 subsection (a) of this section, issuance of the corrected new bill does not
11 extend the time for payment of the original bill nor relieve the taxpayer of any
12 interest or penalties associated with the original bill. If the corrected bill is less
13 than the original bill, and there are also no unpaid current year taxes, interest,
14 or penalties, and no past year delinquent taxes or penalties and interest charges,
15 any overpayment shall be reflected on the corrected tax bill and refunded to the
16 taxpayer.
17 (2) For property tax credit amounts for which municipalities receive
18 notice after November 1, municipalities shall issue a new homestead property
19 tax bill with notice to the taxpayer of the total amount allocated to payment of
20 homestead property tax liabilities and notice of the balance due.

2 allocated first to current year property tax on the homestead parcel, next to
3 current-year homestead parcel penalties and interest, next to any prior year
4 homestead parcel penalties and interest, and last to any prior year property tax
5 on the homestead parcel. No credit shall be allocated to a property tax liability
6 for any year after the year for which the claim or refund allocation was filed.
7 No municipal tax-reduction incentive for early payment of taxes shall apply to
8 any amount allocated to the property tax bill under this chapter.
9 (4) If the property tax credit amount as described in subsection (e) of
10 this section exceeds the property tax, penalties, and interest due for the current
11 and all prior years, the municipality shall refund the excess to the taxpayer,
12 without interest, within 20 days of the first date upon which taxes become due
13 and payable or 20 days after notification of the credit amount by the
14 Commissioner of Taxes, whichever is later. [Repealed.]

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.104

1 S.104
2 Introduced by Senator Vyhovsky
3 Referred to Committee on
4 Date:
5 Subject: Education; State funding of public education; taxation and finance;
6 education property tax; education income tax; education finance
7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to transition
8 from an education property tax to an education income tax in fiscal year 2027.
9 This bill would create an education tax that is based on the income of Vermont
10 homeowners with a rate determined by locally voted budgets. This bill
11 proposes to impose the education tax on the income of all Vermont residents
12 (both homeowners and renters) in fiscal year 2030. This bill would eliminate
13 the homestead education property tax and levy the nonhomestead education
14 property tax on all property except residential dwellings and the two-acre
15 parcel surrounding the dwellings. This bill would continue to provide the
16 existing renter credit and create a new renter credit against the education
17 income tax. This bill also proposes to update the property tax credit income
18 sensitivity measures to provide relief to a broader class of Vermont taxpayers
19 in fiscal year 2026. This bill also proposes to address revenue lost due to the
20 expansion of the income sensitivity measures by creating a one-year new top
21 marginal tax rate on income.

10 Sec. 30. 32 V.S.A. § 6066a is amended to read:

12 (a) Annually, the Commissioner shall determine the municipal property tax
13 credit amount under section 6066 of this title, related to a homestead owned by
14 the claimant, based on the prior taxable year’s income and crediting municipal
15 property taxes paid in the prior year. The Commissioner shall notify the
16 municipality in which the housesite is located of the amount of the property tax
17 credit for the claimant for homestead municipal property tax liabilities on a
18 monthly basis. The tax credit of a claimant who was assessed property tax by
19 a town that revised the dates of its fiscal year, however, is the excess of the
20 municipal property tax that was assessed in the last 12 months of the revised
21 fiscal year, over the adjusted property tax of the claimant for the revised fiscal

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.104

1 year, as determined under section 6066 of this title, related to a homestead

3 (b) The Commissioner shall include in the total property tax credit amount
4 determined under subsection (a) of this section, for credit to the taxpayer for
5 homestead property tax liabilities, any income tax overpayment remaining
6 after allocation under section 3112 of this title and setoff under section 5934 of
7 this title, which the taxpayer has directed to be used for payment of property
8 taxes. [Repealed.]
9 (c) The Commissioner shall notify the municipality of any claim and
10 refund amounts unresolved by November 1 at the time of final resolution,
11 including adjudication, if any; provided, however, that towns will not be
12 notified of any additional credit amounts after November 1 of the claim year,
13 and such amounts shall be paid to the claimant by the Commissioner.
14 (d) [Repealed.]
15 (e) At the time of notice to the municipality, the Commissioner shall notify
16 the taxpayer of the municipal property tax credit amount determined under
17 subdivision subsection 6066(a)(1) of this title, the amount determined under
18 subdivision 6066(a)(3) of this title, any additional credit amounts due the

20 refund, if any, allocated to payment of homestead property tax liabilities, and
21 any late-claim reduction amount.

1 (f)(1) For taxpayers and amounts stated in the notice to towns on or before
2 July 1, municipalities shall create and send to taxpayers a homestead property
3 tax bill, instead of the bill required under subdivision 5402(b)(1) of this title,
4 providing the total amount allocated to payment of homestead education
5 property tax liabilities and notice of the balance due. Municipalities shall
6 apply the amount allocated under this chapter to current year property taxes in
7 equal amounts to each of the taxpayers’ property tax installments that include
8 education taxes. Notwithstanding section 4772 of this title, if a town issues a
9 corrected bill as a result of the notice sent by the Commissioner under
10 subsection (a) of this section, issuance of the corrected new bill does not
11 extend the time for payment of the original bill nor relieve the taxpayer of any
12 interest or penalties associated with the original bill. If the corrected bill is less
13 than the original bill, and there are also no unpaid current year taxes, interest,
14 or penalties, and no past year delinquent taxes or penalties and interest charges,
15 any overpayment shall be reflected on the corrected tax bill and refunded to the
16 taxpayer.
17 (2) For property tax credit amounts for which municipalities receive
18 notice after November 1, municipalities shall issue a new homestead property
19 tax bill with notice to the taxpayer of the total amount allocated to payment of
20 homestead property tax liabilities and notice of the balance due.

1 (3) The property tax credit amount determined for the taxpayer shall be
2 allocated first to current year property tax on the homestead parcel, next to
3 current-year homestead parcel penalties and interest, next to any prior year
4 homestead parcel penalties and interest, and last to any prior year property tax
5 on the homestead parcel. No credit shall be allocated to a property tax liability
6 for any year after the year for which the claim or refund allocation was filed.
7 No municipal tax-reduction incentive for early payment of taxes shall apply to
8 any amount allocated to the property tax bill under this chapter.
9 (4) If the property tax credit amount as described in subsection (e) of
10 this section exceeds the property tax, penalties, and interest due for the current
11 and all prior years, the municipality shall refund the excess to the taxpayer,
12 without interest, within 20 days of the first date upon which taxes become due
13 and payable or 20 days after notification of the credit amount by the
14 Commissioner of Taxes, whichever is later. [Repealed.]
15 (g) The Commissioner of Taxes shall pay monthly to each municipality the
16 amount of municipal property tax credit of which the municipality was last
17 notified related to municipal property tax on homesteads within that
18 municipality, as determined by the Commissioner of Taxes.
