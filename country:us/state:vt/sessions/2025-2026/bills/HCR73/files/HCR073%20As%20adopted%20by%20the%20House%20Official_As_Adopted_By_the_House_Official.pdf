State of Vermont
House of Representatives
Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 73
Offered by Representative Burke of Brattleboro
House concurrent resolution designating April 10, 2025 as Museums and Libraries Day at the State House
Whereas, museums and libraries are the cornerstone of our democracy, serve as public forums to debate big
ideas, and are places to learn of past societies and gain guidance for shaping the future, and
Whereas, the State of Vermont is home to more museums per capita than any other state in the nation, with
48 museums per 100,000 residents, and there are nearly 300 statewide, and
Whereas, most Vermont museums are small local historical organizations, and their predominantly volunteer
staff serve in these roles because they love their communities and the associated heritage these special
institutions are preserving, in the form of archives, objects, and stories for future generations, and
Whereas, similarly, the State of Vermont hosts more libraries per capita than any other state, totaling 185
public libraries or 28 per 100,000 residents, and
Whereas, the modern library is not merely a convenient depository of circulating books and a wonderful
place to read, but, equally important, it serves as the heart of our communities by lending tools; hosting musical
performances and lectures; exhibiting films; acting as an emergency response hub and information technology
access center; and, more broadly, as a community facility where curiosity can be satisfied and our common
humanity shared among each other, and
Whereas, museums and libraries often combine their facilities and services, offering the best of both
educational milieus, and
Whereas, today, April 10, 2025, staff and volunteers from the Vermont Historical Society, which, since 1838,
has served as one of the premiere organizations in Vermont combining both museum and library facilities and
services, are visiting the State House to remind the General Assembly of the great community worth of both
their own institution and of museums and libraries across the Green Mountain State, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly designates April 10, 2025 as Museums and Libraries Day at the State House, and
be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the Vermont Historical
Society.
