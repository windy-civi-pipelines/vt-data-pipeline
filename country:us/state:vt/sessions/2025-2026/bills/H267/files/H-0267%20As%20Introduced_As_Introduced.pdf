4 Date:
5 Subject: Health; hospitals; Vermont Hospital Security Plan
6 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to establish the
7 Vermont Hospital Security Plan, which would provide Vermont residents with
8 coverage for health care services received in a hospital and would provide
9 payments to hospitals for health care services delivered. The Plan would
10 include the annual development of a global hospital budget for the State and
11 individual hospital budgets for each hospital located in Vermont.
12 An act relating to the Vermont Hospital Security Plan
13 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
14 Sec. 1. 33 V.S.A. chapter 18, subchapter 3 is added to read:
15 Subchapter 3. Vermont Hospital Security Plan
16 § 1841. PURPOSE
17 The purposes of this subchapter are to provide all Vermonters with access
18 to and coverage for health care services delivered in hospitals and to provide
19 an opportunity to reduce hospital billing processes and other unnecessary
20 administrative costs. The General Assembly recognizes that the health care

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.267
2025 Page 2 of 11
1 system is in crisis and that most Vermonters do not have the financial ability to
2 pay for increasing health insurance premiums or for the rising costs of health
3 care. Vermonters need access to hospital care, regardless of insurance
4 coverage or ability to pay. In addition, the State must seek the financial
5 sustainability of the health care system, including reducing health care
6 spending and transaction costs. The General Assembly recognizes that health
7 care reform is needed to provide coverage of essential health care services to
8 Vermonters.
