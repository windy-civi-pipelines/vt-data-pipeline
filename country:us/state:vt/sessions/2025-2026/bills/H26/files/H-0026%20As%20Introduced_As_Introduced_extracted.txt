5 Date:
6 Subject: Guardianship proceedings; adult guardianship
7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to combine
8 jurisdiction over adult guardianship proceedings into a single division of the
9 Superior Court, the Probate Division, which would establish rules for the
10 proceedings with a more unified set of procedural protections and options.
11 An act relating to guardianship proceedings
12 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
13 Sec. 1. APPLICATION AND CONSTRUCTION
14 In applying and construing this act, consideration shall be given to the
15 following:
16 (1) Prior to 1978, Vermont statute provided for adult guardianship only
17 through its probate court with minimal procedural protections. See Linda O.
18 Smiddy, “Guardianship for the Adult: A Need for Due Process Protections in
19 Vermont,” 4 Vt. L. Rev. 95 (Spring 1979).

1 (2)(A) The Vermont General Assembly passed Act 192 in 1978, which
2 provided the district court with jurisdiction to appoint the Commissioner of
3 Mental Health as guardian for adults who were not institutionalized yet were
4 determined by the court to be “mentally retarded” and in need of protection
5 and supervision. That act provided for significant improvements in
6 guardianship procedural protections not available in the probate court system
7 at the time, including:
8 (i) a formal definition of the disabling condition upon which
9 guardianship jurisdiction could be founded and the requirement that there be a
10 comprehensive evaluation by a qualified mental retardation professional;
11 (ii) the right to representation by an attorney, at public expense if
12 needed; and
13 (iii) the necessity of a hearing, along with the opportunity to
14 present evidence and the right to subpoena and to cross-examine witnesses.
15 (B) Act 192 guardianship jurisdiction was subsequently assigned to
16 the Family Division of the Superior Court, with the Commissioner of
17 Disabilities, Aging, and Independent Living as appointed guardian. The
18 probate court is now the Probate Division of the Superior Court, and the
19 archaic and offensive term “mentally retarded” is no longer in use.
20 (3) In 1979, the General Assembly added subchapter 12 to the probate
21 court guardianship provisions in 14 V.S.A. chapter 111. Subchapter 12
VT LEG #379500 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.26

1 increased the procedural protections in the probate court so significantly that
2 they outstripped the protections available in what is now the Family Division.
3 In 2010 the differences between the two systems increased even further when
4 the General Assembly provided for voluntary guardianship in the Probate
5 Division without regard to an individual’s disability type. Voluntary
6 guardianship has never been an option in the Family Division.
7 (4) With regard to the Common Benefits Clause of the Vermont
8 Constitution, the General Assembly observed a generation ago that Vermont’s
9 history as an independent republic and as a State is one of equal treatment and
10 respect for all Vermonters. Presently, however, there are approximately 600
11 adults with disabilities for whom the State has been made guardian in the
12 Family Division despite deficiencies in how they are treated under the law
13 compared to how they would be treated in the Probate Division. These
14 differences include:
15 (A) In the Probate Division, under 14 V.S.A. § 3066, the court “may
16 appoint a guardian ad litem if it finds the respondent or person under
17 guardianship is unable to communicate with or advise counsel.” In the Family
18 Division, there is no provision for the appointment of a guardian ad litem.
19 (B) Appeals from the Probate Division to the Civil Division are de
20 novo, and under 12 V.S.A. § 2553 and Rule 72 of the Vermont Rules of Civil
21 Procedure, there is an available retrial in the Civil Division of disputed factual
VT LEG #379500 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.26
2025 Page 4 of 14
1 determinations such as mental incapacity. In the Family Division, only a
2 standard appeal with deference to the factual findings below is available.
3 (C) In the Probate Division, under 14 V.S.A. § 3076(a) and (b), the
4 guardian must file an annual report with the court “on the progress and
5 condition of the person under guardianship … [and] the manner in which the
6 guardian carried out [their duties].” In the Family Division, no annual report is
7 required.
8 (D) In the Probate Division, under 14 V.S.A. § 3073, the residential
9 placement of the person under guardianship may only be changed upon an
10 order of the court made after a motion and hearing. In the Family Division, no
11 court permission is required for a change in residential placement of the person
12 under guardianship.
13 (E) In the Probate Division, under 14 V.S.A. § 3078, the court must
14 mail to the person under guardianship and other persons a copy of the annual
15 report and a statement of the person’s right to seek modification or revocation
16 of the guardianship. In the Family Division, there is no such requirement.
17 (F) In the Probate Division, under 14 V.S.A. § 3076(c), the guardian
18 must file a final accounting with the court at the termination of the
19 guardianship. In the Family Division, no final accounting is required.
VT LEG #379500 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.26
2025 Page 5 of 14
1 (G) In the Probate Division, under 14 V.S.A. § 3067(a), a court order
2 is required for a guardianship evaluation to be conducted. No such order is
3 required in the Family Division.
4 (H) In the Probate Division, under 14 V.S.A. § 3061(1)(B), it must be
5 shown that an alleged incapacity is caused by the purported disability. This is
6 not required in the Family Division.
7 (I) In the Probate Division, under 14 V.S.A. § 3061(2) and (3), the
8 determination that a person is in need of a guardianship must be based upon
9 evidence of recent behavior. This is not required in the Family Division.
10 (J) In the Probate Division, under 14 V.S.A. § 3067(c)(2)(A), the
11 evaluation in connection with whether a person is in need of guardianship must
12 specify aspects of the person’s personal care and financial affairs that the
13 person can manage without supervision or assistance. In the Family Division,
14 this is not required.
15 (K) In the Probate Division, under 14 V.S.A. § 3067(c)(2)(B), the
16 evaluation in connection with whether a person is in need of guardianship must
17 specify aspects of the person’s personal care and financial affairs that the
18 person could manage with the supervision or assistance of support services and
19 benefits. In the Family Division, this is not required.
20 (L) In the Probate Division, under 14 V.S.A. § 3067(c)(2)(D), the
21 evaluation in connection with whether a person is in need of guardianship must
VT LEG #379500 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.26
2025 Page 6 of 14
1 contain a statement of the programs and services that the guardian should
2 provide. In the Family Division, this is not required.
3 (M) In the Probate Division, under 14 V.S.A. § 3071(c), there is a
4 statutory requirement that “the guardian shall always serve the interests of the
5 person under guardianship and shall bring any potential conflicts of interest to
6 the attention of the court.” In the Family Division, there are no such
7 requirements.
8 (N) The option of voluntary guardianship is available in the Probate
9 Division when an individual is able to understand the nature, extent, and
10 consequences of the proposed guardianship even if the person may otherwise
11 have a disability. This option provides for adult guardianship without the
12 stigma of the person being under a judicial finding of mental incapacity.
13 Voluntary guardianship is not an available option in the Family Division.
14 (O) Because the Probate Division is the court in which individuals
15 without disabilities may have guardianships granted for themselves, the current
16 requirement that guardianship proceedings for certain individuals with
17 developmental disabilities must be held in the Family Division instead of the
18 Probate Division may be at odds with the Common Benefits Clause of the
19 Vermont Constitution.

1 Sec. 2. SHORT TITLE
2 This act shall be referred to as “the Adult Guardianship Equity Act” or as
3 “the AGE Act.”
4 Sec. 3. 14 V.S.A. § 3060 is amended to read:
5 § 3060. POLICY
6 (a) Guardianship shall be utilized only as necessary to promote the well-
7 being of the individual and to protect the individual from violations of his or
8 her the individual’s human and civil rights. It shall be designed to encourage
9 the development and maintenance of maximum self-reliance and independence
10 in the individual and only the least restrictive form of guardianship shall be
11 ordered to the extent required by the individual’s actual mental and adaptive
12 limitations. The State of Vermont recognizes the fundamental right of an adult
13 with capacity to determine the extent of health care the individual will receive.
14 (b) A person shall not be subjected to a determination of mental
15 incompetency regarding guardianship if the person would qualify for and agree
16 to the creation of an appropriate voluntary guardianship.
17 (c) Regardless of the form of guardianship applied for, if the proposed
18 person under guardianship qualifies for a voluntary guardianship under section
19 2671 of this title and agrees to the creation of an appropriate voluntary
20 guardianship, then voluntary guardianship shall be deemed the least restrictive
21 form of guardianship under subsection (a) of this section.

14 title shall apply. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the cost of
15 the evaluation shall be paid for out of the respondent’s estate or as ordered by
16 the court. If the respondent is unable to afford some or all of the cost of the
17 evaluation without expending income or liquid resources necessary for living

3 In 2010 the differences between the two systems increased even further when
4 the General Assembly provided for voluntary guardianship in the Probate
5 Division without regard to an individual’s disability type. Voluntary
6 guardianship has never been an option in the Family Division.

10 consequences of the proposed guardianship even if the person may otherwise
11 have a disability. This option provides for adult guardianship without the
12 stigma of the person being under a judicial finding of mental incapacity.
13 Voluntary guardianship is not an available option in the Family Division.
14 (O) Because the Probate Division is the court in which individuals
15 without disabilities may have guardianships granted for themselves, the current
16 requirement that guardianship proceedings for certain individuals with
17 developmental disabilities must be held in the Family Division instead of the
18 Probate Division may be at odds with the Common Benefits Clause of the
19 Vermont Constitution.

1 Sec. 2. SHORT TITLE
2 This act shall be referred to as “the Adult Guardianship Equity Act” or as
3 “the AGE Act.”
4 Sec. 3. 14 V.S.A. § 3060 is amended to read:

8 her the individual’s human and civil rights. It shall be designed to encourage
9 the development and maintenance of maximum self-reliance and independence
10 in the individual and only the least restrictive form of guardianship shall be
11 ordered to the extent required by the individual’s actual mental and adaptive
12 limitations. The State of Vermont recognizes the fundamental right of an adult
13 with capacity to determine the extent of health care the individual will receive.
14 (b) A person shall not be subjected to a determination of mental
15 incompetency regarding guardianship if the person would qualify for and agree
16 to the creation of an appropriate voluntary guardianship.
17 (c) Regardless of the form of guardianship applied for, if the proposed
18 person under guardianship qualifies for a voluntary guardianship under section
19 2671 of this title and agrees to the creation of an appropriate voluntary
20 guardianship, then voluntary guardianship shall be deemed the least restrictive
21 form of guardianship under subsection (a) of this section.
