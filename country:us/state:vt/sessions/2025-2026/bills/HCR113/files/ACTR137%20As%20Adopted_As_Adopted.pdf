Whereas, Vermont Afterschool, the proud sponsor of the Jr Iron Chef VT cooking
competition, describes the event as being one in which “youth from across the state are
brought together to stand side-by-side in an orchestrated frenzy—dicing, grating, and
sautéing their way to culinary fame,” and
Whereas, on March 29, 2025, the 17th rendition of this unusual cooking extravaganza,
which encourages student chefs “to create locally sourced meals that promote Vermont’s
Farm to School” program, was convened at the Champlain Valley Exposition in Essex
Junction, and
Whereas, the popularity of this career exploration initiative is reflected in the more
than 5,000 Vermont middle and high school students, who since 2008 have
enthusiastically maximized their cooking skills and ingenuity as members of 1,000
participating teams, and
Whereas, the teams compete for three awards: Lively Local, honoring the team that
best highlights Vermont foods; Mise en Place, honoring the team that shows exemplary
teamwork, order, and professionalism; and Crowd Pleaser, honoring the team that best
incorporates color, texture, and taste, and

names, and their culinary creations were as follows:
