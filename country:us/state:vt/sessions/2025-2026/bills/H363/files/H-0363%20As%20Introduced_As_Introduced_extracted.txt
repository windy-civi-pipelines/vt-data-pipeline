5 (3) “Consistent majority winner” means the sole candidate who is the
6 winning candidate in every paired comparison among all candidates.
7 (4) “Paired comparison” or “head-to-head comparison” means an
8 evaluation of two candidates for the purpose of determining which candidate
9 has the greater number of ballots ranking that candidate over the other
10 candidate in the pair.
11 (5) “Plurality” means the election outcome in which one candidate
12 receives more votes than any other candidate, but not necessarily a majority of
13 the votes cast.

14 alphabetical order. The ballot shall allow voters to assign rankings to
15 candidates that are equal to the number of printed candidate names and blank
16 write-in lines.
17 (b) Counting votes.
18 (1) A ballot assigning a candidate a lower ordinal preference shall be
19 considered to have assigned a higher ranking to that candidate than to a
20 candidate who was assigned a higher ordinal preference. A ballot assigning a
