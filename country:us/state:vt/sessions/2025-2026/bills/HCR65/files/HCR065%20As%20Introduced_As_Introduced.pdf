House concurrent resolution recognizing May 2025 as Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Awareness Month in
Vermont
Whereas, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, progressive supranuclear
palsy (PSP) is a rare onset progressive neurological disorder that affects numerous essential physical and mental
functions, and
Whereas, an estimated 20,000 Americans have been diagnosed with this disorder, and the specific symptoms
are individually unique, and
Whereas, PSP’s symptoms usually appear at 60 years of age or older, although in some cases earlier, and
they can result in an individual becoming depressed, forgetful, and irritable and cause an individual to have
sleeping challenges, and
Whereas, individuals with PSP can experience severe quality-of-life issues, and contracting this disorder can
necessitate complexcare requirements that negatively impact family relationships and the lives of
caregivers, and
Whereas, although outwardly similar to Parkinson’s disease, PSP is a distinct disorder that is part of the
group of disorders known collectively as atypical parkinsonism, and
Whereas, at present, there is neither a cure nor even a modifying treatment, and although some symptoms
may be managed with medication and care, the lack of understanding about the disease has often led to
misdiagnosis, and this lack of medical knowledge hinders both intervention efforts and clinical trials, and
Whereas, the recognition of May 2025 as Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Awareness Month will create
greater public and health care community awareness of PSP, highlight the continuing effort to find a cure, and
provide comfort to the families whose lives have been drastically altered, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly recognizes May 2025 as Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Awareness Month in
Vermont, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to CurePSP in New York
City and to the Vermont Medical Society.
