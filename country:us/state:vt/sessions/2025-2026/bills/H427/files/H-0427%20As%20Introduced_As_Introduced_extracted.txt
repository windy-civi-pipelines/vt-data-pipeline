3 Sec. 2. 12 V.S.A. chapter 223 is added to read:
4 CHAPTER 223. SCREENING PANELS FOR
5 MEDICAL INJURY CLAIMS
6 § 7401. FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND INTENT
7 (a) Availability and affordability of insurance against liability for medical
8 injury is essential for the protection of patients as well as ensuring availability
9 of and access to essential medical and hospital care. This chapter affirms the
10 intent of the General Assembly to contain the costs of the medical injury
11 reparations system and to promote availability and affordability of insurance
12 against liability for medical injury. Claims for medical injury should be
13 resolved as early and inexpensively as possible to contain system costs.
14 Claims that are resolved before court determination cost less to resolve than
15 claims that must be resolved by a court. Meritorious claims should be
16 identified as quickly as possible, as should nonmeritorious claims. Defendants
17 should consider paying or compromising on meritorious claims, and plaintiffs
18 should consider withdrawing or compromising on nonmeritorious claims, as
19 soon as the merits of the claims are known to the parties. Presentation of
20 claims to a medical review panel is intended to help identify both meritorious
21 and nonmeritorious claims without the delay and expense of a court trial. It is
VT LEG #380514 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.427
2025 Page 3 of 18
1 essential to the effectiveness of the panel process that panel proceedings be
2 confidential unless and until a matter heard by a panel proceeds to trial. It is
3 equally essential to the effectiveness of the panel process that a panel’s
4 unanimous findings be presented to the jury in any matter that is not resolved
5 prior to trial. The panel process will encourage the prompt resolution of claims
6 because both sides will be given an objective view of the merits. If the panel
7 finds that a claim has merit, the defendant will be more likely to pay the claim
8 or negotiate a compromise that is favorable to the claimant. If the panel finds
9 that the claim lacks merit, the claimant is more likely to withdraw the claim or
10 accept a nominal settlement.
11 (b) The purposes of pretrial screening panels are:
12 (1) to identify claims of professional negligence that merit compensation
13 and to encourage early resolution of those claims prior to commencement of a
14 lawsuit; and
15 (2) to identify claims of professional negligence and to encourage early
16 withdrawal or dismissal of nonmeritorious claims.
17 § 7402. DEFINITIONS
18 As used in this chapter:
19 (1) “Action for medical injury” means any action against a medical care
20 provider, whether based in tort, contract, or otherwise, to recover damages on
21 account of medical injury.
VT LEG #380514 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.427
2025 Page 4 of 18
1 (2) “Medical care provider” means a physician, physician assistant,
2 registered or licensed practical nurse, hospital, clinic, or other health care
3 agency licensed by the State or otherwise lawfully providing medical care or
4 services, or an officer, employee, or agent thereof acting in the course and
5 scope of employment.
6 (3) “Medical injury” or “injury” means any adverse, untoward, or
7 undesired consequences arising out of or sustained in the course of
8 professional services rendered by a medical care provider, whether resulting
9 from negligence, error, or omission in the performance of such services; from
10 rendition of such services without informed consent or in breach of warranty or
11 in violation of contract; from failure to diagnose; from premature abandonment
12 of a patient or of a course of treatment; from failure properly to maintain
13 equipment or appliances necessary to the rendition of such services; or
14 otherwise arising out of or sustained in the course of such services.
15 § 7403. FORMATION AND PROCEDURE
16 (a) The Supreme Court shall maintain a list of retired judges, persons with
17 judicial experience, and other qualified persons to serve on screening panels
18 under this chapter from which the Chief Justice shall choose a panel chair
19 under subsection (b) of this section. The Court shall maintain lists of health
20 care practitioners and attorneys with litigation experience, recommended by
21 their respective professional organizations to serve on screening panels under
VT LEG #380514 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.427
2025 Page 5 of 18
1 this chapter. As directed by the Court, the professional organization of each
2 profession shall inform the Court of the names of volunteers to serve on
3 panels.
4 (b) Screening panel members shall be selected as follows:
5 (1) Upon the entry of a medical injury case, the clerk of the Superior
6 Court in which the medical injury case is filed shall notify the Chief Justice of
7 the Supreme Court.
8 (2) Within 14 days following the return date, the Chief Justice shall
9 choose a retired judge, a person with judicial experience, or other qualified
10 person from the list maintained by the Court to serve as chair of the panel to
11 screen the claim. If at any time the Chair chosen under this subsection is
12 unable or unwilling to serve, the Chief Justice shall appoint a replacement
13 following the procedure in this subsection for the initial appointment of the
14 Chair. Persons other than retired judges or those with judicial experience may
15 be appointed as chair based on appropriate trial experience. If the Chief
16 Justice appoints as chair a person who is not a retired judge or who does not
17 have judicial experience, each side may make one challenge to the
18 appointment.
19 (3) The Chief Justice shall notify the clerk of the name of the person
20 designated to serve as chair and shall provide the clerk with the lists of health
21 care practitioners, health care providers, and attorneys maintained under this
VT LEG #380514 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.427
2025 Page 6 of 18
1 section. Upon notification of the Chief Justice’s choice of chair, the clerk shall
2 notify the Chair and the parties, and provide them with the lists of health care
3 practitioners, health care providers, and attorneys. The Chair shall choose two
4 or three additional panel members from the lists as follows:
5 (A) One attorney.
6 (B) One health care practitioner. If possible, the Chair shall choose a
7 practitioner who practices in the same specialty or profession as the person or
8 entity accused of professional negligence.
9 (C) Where the claim involves more than one person accused of
10 professional negligence, the Chair may choose a fourth panel member who is a
11 health care practitioner. If possible, the Chair shall choose a practitioner or
12 provider in the specialty or profession of a person accused.
13 (D) When agreed upon by all the parties, the list of available panel
14 members may be enlarged in order to select a panel member who is agreed to
15 by the parties but who is not on the Court’s list.
16 (4) The screening panel process is not intended to delay or postpone the
17 trial of a medical injury case. The Superior Court may establish a trial date
18 and all interim deadlines as it would in any other case.
19 (5) The Supreme Court shall establish the compensation of the panel
20 Chair if the Chair is not otherwise compensated by the State. Other panel
21 members shall serve without compensation or payment of expenses.
VT LEG #380514 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.427
2025 Page 7 of 18
1 (6) The clerk of the Superior Court in the unit in which a medical injury
2 case is filed shall, with the consent of the Supreme Court, provide clerical and
3 other assistance to the panel Chair.
4 (7) Only challenges for cause shall be allowed. If a panel member other
5 than the Chair is challenged for cause, the party challenging the member shall
6 notify the panel Chair. If the panel Chair finds cause for the challenge, the
7 Chair shall replace the panel member. If the Chair is challenged for cause, the
8 party challenging the Chair shall notify the Chief Justice, who shall replace the
9 Chair upon a finding of cause.
10 (8) The panel, through the Chair, shall have the same subpoena power as
11 exists for a Superior Judge. The Chair shall have sole authority, without
12 requiring the agreement of other panel members, to issue subpoenas.
13 (9) The Vermont Rules of Civil Procedure shall govern discovery
14 conducted under this chapter. The parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve
15 discovery issues themselves. The Chair shall rule on disputes regarding
16 discovery. Any person aggrieved by a Chair’s ruling regarding discovery may
17 appeal to the Civil Division of the Superior Court, which shall defer to the
18 Chair’s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.
19 § 7404. PANEL PROCEDURES
20 (a) All documents filed with the Court in a medical injury action that are
21 part of the screening process are confidential.
VT LEG #380514 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.427
2025 Page 8 of 18
1 (b) Within 20 days after the return date, the person or persons accused shall
2 contact the claimant’s counsel and by agreement shall designate a timetable for
3 filing all the relevant medical and provider records necessary to a
4 determination by the panel. If the parties are unable to agree on a timetable
5 within 60 days after the return date, the claimant shall notify the Chair of the
6 panel. The Chair shall then establish a timetable for the filing of all relevant
7 records and reasonable discovery, which shall be filed at least 30 days before
8 any hearing date. The hearing shall be not later than six months from the
9 return date, except when the time period has been extended by the panel Chair
10 in accordance with this chapter.
11 (c) The pretrial screening may be bypassed if all parties agree upon a
12 resolution of the claim by trial.
13 (d) All parties to a claim may, by written agreement, submit a claim to the
14 binding determination of the panel. Both parties may agree to bypass the panel
15 for any reason or may request that certain preliminary legal affirmative
16 defenses or issues be litigated prior to submission of the case to the panel. The
17 panel shall have no jurisdiction to hear or decide, absent agreement of the
18 parties, dispositive legal affirmative defenses, other than comparative
19 negligence. The panel Chair may require the parties to litigate, by motion,
20 dispositive legal affirmative defenses in the Civil Division of the Superior
21 Court prior to submission of the case to the panel. Any such defense, as well
VT LEG #380514 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.427
2025 Page 9 of 18
1 as any motion relating to discovery that the panel Chair has chosen not to rule
2 on, may be presented by motion to the Court.
3 (e) Except as otherwise provided in this section, there shall be one
4 combined hearing for all claims under this section arising out of the same set
5 of facts. When a medical injury case has been filed against more than one
6 person accused of medical injury based on the same facts, the parties may,
7 upon agreement of all parties, require that hearings be separated. The Chair
8 may, for good cause, order separate hearings.
9 (f) All requests for extensions of time under this section shall be made to
10 the panel Chair. The Chair may extend any time period for good cause, except
11 that the Chair may not extend any time period that would result in the hearing
12 being held more than 11 months following the return date, unless good cause is
13 shown.
14 (g)(1)(A) On failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with rules or
15 any order of the Chair or if the plaintiff fails to attend a properly scheduled
16 hearing, and on motion by the Chair or any party, after notice to all parties has
17 been given and the party against whom sanctions are proposed has had the
18 opportunity to be heard and show good cause, the Chair may order appropriate
19 sanctions, which may include dismissal of the case. If any sanctions are
20 imposed, the Chair shall state the sanctions in writing and include the grounds
21 for the sanctions.
VT LEG #380514 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.427
2025 Page 10 of 18
1 (B) Unless the Chair or the panel in an order for dismissal specifies
2 otherwise, a dismissal under this subdivision (1) is with prejudice for purposes
3 of proceedings before the panel. A dismissal with prejudice is the equivalent
4 of a finding for the defendant on all issues before the panel.
5 (2)(A) On failure of a defendant to comply with the rules or any order of
6 the Chair, or if a defendant fails to attend a properly scheduled hearing, and on
7 motion by the Chair or any party, after notice to all parties has been given and
8 the party against whom sanctions are proposed has had the opportunity to be
9 heard and show good cause, the Chair may order appropriate sanctions, which
10 may include default. If any sanctions are imposed, the Chair shall state the
11 sanctions in writing and include the grounds for the sanctions.
12 (B) Unless the Chair or the panel in its order for default specifies
13 otherwise, a default under this subdivision (2) is the equivalent of a finding
14 against the defendant on all issues before the panel.
15 (3) Any person aggrieved by a Chair’s ruling regarding sanctions may
16 appeal to the Superior Court, which shall defer to the Chair’s factual findings
17 unless they are clearly erroneous.
18 § 7405. HEARING
19 (a)(1) The claimant or a representative of the claimant shall present the
20 case before the panel. The person accused of professional negligence or that
21 person’s representative shall make a responding presentation. The panel shall
VT LEG #380514 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.427
2025 Page 11 of 18
1 afford the parties wide latitude in the conduct of the hearing including, but not
2 limited to, the right of examination and cross-examination by attorneys.
3 Depositions are admissible whether or not the person deposed is available at
4 the hearing. The Chair shall make all procedural rulings, which shall be final.
5 The Vermont Rules of Evidence shall not apply. Evidence shall be admitted if
6 it is the kind of evidence upon which reasonable persons are accustomed to
7 rely in the conduct of their affairs. The panel shall make findings upon
8 evidence presented at the hearing, the records, and any expert opinions
9 provided by or sought by the panel or the parties.
10 (2) After presentation by the parties, the panel may request additional
11 facts, records, or other information from either party to be submitted in writing
12 or at a continued hearing, which continued hearing shall be held as soon as
13 possible. The continued hearing shall be attended by the same members of the
14 panel who have sat on all prior hearings in the same claim, unless otherwise
15 agreed by all parties. Replacement panel members shall be appointed pursuant
16 to this chapter.
17 (b) The panel shall maintain an electronically recorded record. Except as
18 provided in section 7408 of this title, the record shall not be made public, and
19 the hearings shall not be public without the consent of all parties.
20 (c) The Chair of the panel shall attempt to mediate any differences of the
21 parties before proceeding to findings.

6 from the applicable standard of care by the medical care provider charged with
7 that care;

17 preponderance of the evidence.

4 CHAPTER 223. SCREENING PANELS FOR
5 MEDICAL INJURY CLAIMS
6 § 7401. FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND INTENT
7 (a) Availability and affordability of insurance against liability for medical
8 injury is essential for the protection of patients as well as ensuring availability
9 of and access to essential medical and hospital care. This chapter affirms the
10 intent of the General Assembly to contain the costs of the medical injury
11 reparations system and to promote availability and affordability of insurance
12 against liability for medical injury. Claims for medical injury should be
13 resolved as early and inexpensively as possible to contain system costs.
14 Claims that are resolved before court determination cost less to resolve than
15 claims that must be resolved by a court. Meritorious claims should be
16 identified as quickly as possible, as should nonmeritorious claims. Defendants
17 should consider paying or compromising on meritorious claims, and plaintiffs
18 should consider withdrawing or compromising on nonmeritorious claims, as
19 soon as the merits of the claims are known to the parties. Presentation of
20 claims to a medical review panel is intended to help identify both meritorious
21 and nonmeritorious claims without the delay and expense of a court trial. It is
VT LEG #380514 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.427
2025 Page 3 of 18
1 essential to the effectiveness of the panel process that panel proceedings be
2 confidential unless and until a matter heard by a panel proceeds to trial. It is
3 equally essential to the effectiveness of the panel process that a panel’s
4 unanimous findings be presented to the jury in any matter that is not resolved
5 prior to trial. The panel process will encourage the prompt resolution of claims
6 because both sides will be given an objective view of the merits. If the panel
7 finds that a claim has merit, the defendant will be more likely to pay the claim
8 or negotiate a compromise that is favorable to the claimant. If the panel finds
9 that the claim lacks merit, the claimant is more likely to withdraw the claim or
10 accept a nominal settlement.
11 (b) The purposes of pretrial screening panels are:
12 (1) to identify claims of professional negligence that merit compensation
13 and to encourage early resolution of those claims prior to commencement of a
14 lawsuit; and
15 (2) to identify claims of professional negligence and to encourage early
16 withdrawal or dismissal of nonmeritorious claims.
17 § 7402. DEFINITIONS
18 As used in this chapter:
19 (1) “Action for medical injury” means any action against a medical care
20 provider, whether based in tort, contract, or otherwise, to recover damages on
21 account of medical injury.
VT LEG #380514 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.427
2025 Page 4 of 18
1 (2) “Medical care provider” means a physician, physician assistant,
2 registered or licensed practical nurse, hospital, clinic, or other health care
3 agency licensed by the State or otherwise lawfully providing medical care or
4 services, or an officer, employee, or agent thereof acting in the course and
5 scope of employment.
6 (3) “Medical injury” or “injury” means any adverse, untoward, or
7 undesired consequences arising out of or sustained in the course of
8 professional services rendered by a medical care provider, whether resulting
9 from negligence, error, or omission in the performance of such services; from
10 rendition of such services without informed consent or in breach of warranty or
11 in violation of contract; from failure to diagnose; from premature abandonment
12 of a patient or of a course of treatment; from failure properly to maintain
13 equipment or appliances necessary to the rendition of such services; or
14 otherwise arising out of or sustained in the course of such services.
15 § 7403. FORMATION AND PROCEDURE
16 (a) The Supreme Court shall maintain a list of retired judges, persons with
17 judicial experience, and other qualified persons to serve on screening panels
18 under this chapter from which the Chief Justice shall choose a panel chair
19 under subsection (b) of this section. The Court shall maintain lists of health
20 care practitioners and attorneys with litigation experience, recommended by
21 their respective professional organizations to serve on screening panels under
VT LEG #380514 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.427
2025 Page 5 of 18
1 this chapter. As directed by the Court, the professional organization of each
2 profession shall inform the Court of the names of volunteers to serve on
3 panels.
4 (b) Screening panel members shall be selected as follows:
5 (1) Upon the entry of a medical injury case, the clerk of the Superior
6 Court in which the medical injury case is filed shall notify the Chief Justice of
7 the Supreme Court.
8 (2) Within 14 days following the return date, the Chief Justice shall
9 choose a retired judge, a person with judicial experience, or other qualified
10 person from the list maintained by the Court to serve as chair of the panel to
11 screen the claim. If at any time the Chair chosen under this subsection is
12 unable or unwilling to serve, the Chief Justice shall appoint a replacement
13 following the procedure in this subsection for the initial appointment of the
14 Chair. Persons other than retired judges or those with judicial experience may
15 be appointed as chair based on appropriate trial experience. If the Chief
16 Justice appoints as chair a person who is not a retired judge or who does not
17 have judicial experience, each side may make one challenge to the
18 appointment.
19 (3) The Chief Justice shall notify the clerk of the name of the person
20 designated to serve as chair and shall provide the clerk with the lists of health
21 care practitioners, health care providers, and attorneys maintained under this
VT LEG #380514 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.427
2025 Page 6 of 18
1 section. Upon notification of the Chief Justice’s choice of chair, the clerk shall
2 notify the Chair and the parties, and provide them with the lists of health care
3 practitioners, health care providers, and attorneys. The Chair shall choose two
4 or three additional panel members from the lists as follows:
5 (A) One attorney.
6 (B) One health care practitioner. If possible, the Chair shall choose a
7 practitioner who practices in the same specialty or profession as the person or
8 entity accused of professional negligence.
9 (C) Where the claim involves more than one person accused of
10 professional negligence, the Chair may choose a fourth panel member who is a
11 health care practitioner. If possible, the Chair shall choose a practitioner or
12 provider in the specialty or profession of a person accused.
13 (D) When agreed upon by all the parties, the list of available panel
14 members may be enlarged in order to select a panel member who is agreed to
15 by the parties but who is not on the Court’s list.
16 (4) The screening panel process is not intended to delay or postpone the
17 trial of a medical injury case. The Superior Court may establish a trial date
18 and all interim deadlines as it would in any other case.
19 (5) The Supreme Court shall establish the compensation of the panel
20 Chair if the Chair is not otherwise compensated by the State. Other panel
21 members shall serve without compensation or payment of expenses.
VT LEG #380514 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.427
2025 Page 7 of 18
1 (6) The clerk of the Superior Court in the unit in which a medical injury
2 case is filed shall, with the consent of the Supreme Court, provide clerical and
3 other assistance to the panel Chair.
4 (7) Only challenges for cause shall be allowed. If a panel member other
5 than the Chair is challenged for cause, the party challenging the member shall
6 notify the panel Chair. If the panel Chair finds cause for the challenge, the
7 Chair shall replace the panel member. If the Chair is challenged for cause, the
8 party challenging the Chair shall notify the Chief Justice, who shall replace the
9 Chair upon a finding of cause.
10 (8) The panel, through the Chair, shall have the same subpoena power as
11 exists for a Superior Judge. The Chair shall have sole authority, without
12 requiring the agreement of other panel members, to issue subpoenas.
13 (9) The Vermont Rules of Civil Procedure shall govern discovery
14 conducted under this chapter. The parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve
15 discovery issues themselves. The Chair shall rule on disputes regarding
16 discovery. Any person aggrieved by a Chair’s ruling regarding discovery may
17 appeal to the Civil Division of the Superior Court, which shall defer to the
18 Chair’s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.
19 § 7404. PANEL PROCEDURES
20 (a) All documents filed with the Court in a medical injury action that are
21 part of the screening process are confidential.
VT LEG #380514 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.427
2025 Page 8 of 18
1 (b) Within 20 days after the return date, the person or persons accused shall
2 contact the claimant’s counsel and by agreement shall designate a timetable for
3 filing all the relevant medical and provider records necessary to a
4 determination by the panel. If the parties are unable to agree on a timetable
5 within 60 days after the return date, the claimant shall notify the Chair of the
6 panel. The Chair shall then establish a timetable for the filing of all relevant
7 records and reasonable discovery, which shall be filed at least 30 days before
8 any hearing date. The hearing shall be not later than six months from the
9 return date, except when the time period has been extended by the panel Chair
10 in accordance with this chapter.
11 (c) The pretrial screening may be bypassed if all parties agree upon a
12 resolution of the claim by trial.
13 (d) All parties to a claim may, by written agreement, submit a claim to the
14 binding determination of the panel. Both parties may agree to bypass the panel
15 for any reason or may request that certain preliminary legal affirmative
16 defenses or issues be litigated prior to submission of the case to the panel. The
17 panel shall have no jurisdiction to hear or decide, absent agreement of the
18 parties, dispositive legal affirmative defenses, other than comparative
19 negligence. The panel Chair may require the parties to litigate, by motion,
20 dispositive legal affirmative defenses in the Civil Division of the Superior
21 Court prior to submission of the case to the panel. Any such defense, as well
VT LEG #380514 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.427
2025 Page 9 of 18
1 as any motion relating to discovery that the panel Chair has chosen not to rule
2 on, may be presented by motion to the Court.
3 (e) Except as otherwise provided in this section, there shall be one
4 combined hearing for all claims under this section arising out of the same set
5 of facts. When a medical injury case has been filed against more than one
6 person accused of medical injury based on the same facts, the parties may,
7 upon agreement of all parties, require that hearings be separated. The Chair
8 may, for good cause, order separate hearings.
9 (f) All requests for extensions of time under this section shall be made to
10 the panel Chair. The Chair may extend any time period for good cause, except
11 that the Chair may not extend any time period that would result in the hearing
12 being held more than 11 months following the return date, unless good cause is
13 shown.
14 (g)(1)(A) On failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with rules or
15 any order of the Chair or if the plaintiff fails to attend a properly scheduled
16 hearing, and on motion by the Chair or any party, after notice to all parties has
17 been given and the party against whom sanctions are proposed has had the
18 opportunity to be heard and show good cause, the Chair may order appropriate
19 sanctions, which may include dismissal of the case. If any sanctions are
20 imposed, the Chair shall state the sanctions in writing and include the grounds
21 for the sanctions.
VT LEG #380514 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.427
2025 Page 10 of 18
1 (B) Unless the Chair or the panel in an order for dismissal specifies
2 otherwise, a dismissal under this subdivision (1) is with prejudice for purposes
3 of proceedings before the panel. A dismissal with prejudice is the equivalent
4 of a finding for the defendant on all issues before the panel.
5 (2)(A) On failure of a defendant to comply with the rules or any order of
6 the Chair, or if a defendant fails to attend a properly scheduled hearing, and on
7 motion by the Chair or any party, after notice to all parties has been given and
8 the party against whom sanctions are proposed has had the opportunity to be
9 heard and show good cause, the Chair may order appropriate sanctions, which
10 may include default. If any sanctions are imposed, the Chair shall state the
11 sanctions in writing and include the grounds for the sanctions.
12 (B) Unless the Chair or the panel in its order for default specifies
13 otherwise, a default under this subdivision (2) is the equivalent of a finding
14 against the defendant on all issues before the panel.
15 (3) Any person aggrieved by a Chair’s ruling regarding sanctions may
16 appeal to the Superior Court, which shall defer to the Chair’s factual findings
17 unless they are clearly erroneous.
18 § 7405. HEARING
19 (a)(1) The claimant or a representative of the claimant shall present the
20 case before the panel. The person accused of professional negligence or that
21 person’s representative shall make a responding presentation. The panel shall

1 afford the parties wide latitude in the conduct of the hearing including, but not
2 limited to, the right of examination and cross-examination by attorneys.
3 Depositions are admissible whether or not the person deposed is available at
4 the hearing. The Chair shall make all procedural rulings, which shall be final.
5 The Vermont Rules of Evidence shall not apply. Evidence shall be admitted if
6 it is the kind of evidence upon which reasonable persons are accustomed to
7 rely in the conduct of their affairs. The panel shall make findings upon
8 evidence presented at the hearing, the records, and any expert opinions
9 provided by or sought by the panel or the parties.
10 (2) After presentation by the parties, the panel may request additional
11 facts, records, or other information from either party to be submitted in writing
12 or at a continued hearing, which continued hearing shall be held as soon as
13 possible. The continued hearing shall be attended by the same members of the
14 panel who have sat on all prior hearings in the same claim, unless otherwise
15 agreed by all parties. Replacement panel members shall be appointed pursuant
16 to this chapter.
17 (b) The panel shall maintain an electronically recorded record. Except as
18 provided in section 7408 of this title, the record shall not be made public, and
19 the hearings shall not be public without the consent of all parties.
20 (c) The Chair of the panel shall attempt to mediate any differences of the
21 parties before proceeding to findings.

6 from the applicable standard of care by the medical care provider charged with
7 that care;

14 (1) The plaintiff shall prove negligence and proximate causation by a
15 preponderance of the evidence.

17 preponderance of the evidence.
