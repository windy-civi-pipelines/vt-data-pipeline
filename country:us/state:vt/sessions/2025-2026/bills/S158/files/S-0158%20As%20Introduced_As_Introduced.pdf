3 Referred to Committee on
4 Date:
5 Subject: Elections; campaign finance; contribution limitations
6 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to limit
7 contributions accepted by independent expenditure-only political committees
8 to $5,000.00 per single source, political committee, or political party.
9 An act relating to independent expenditure-only political committee
10 contribution limits
11 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
12 Sec. 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE
13 (a) It was the stated intention of the framers of the Constitution of the
14 United States of America that Congress should be “dependent on the people
15 alone” (James Madison or Alexander Hamilton, Federalist 52). That
16 dependency has evolved from a dependency on the people alone to a
17 dependency on those who spend excessively in elections through campaigns or
18 third-party groups—the result of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Citizens
19 United v. Federal Election Commission, 130 S.Ct. 876 (2010). Citizens United
20 removed restrictions on independent political spending, resulting in a legally
VT LEG #382780 v.1

1 permissible, but undue, influence of powerful economic forces on our elections
2 that has supplanted the will of the people by undermining our ability to choose
3 our political leadership, write our own laws, and determine the fate of our
4 State.
5 (b) Accompanying this spending is the equally problematic acceptance of
6 contributions by these independent entities that, funneled through a now-
7 sanctioned process, nevertheless results in the impairment of a candidate—and
8 eventual officer—in the candidate’s duty to not advantage the contributor in a
9 manner inconsistent with that duty and the rights of Vermonters. The guise of
10 uncoordinated activities between a candidate and a monied interest fails to
11 prevent this corruption.
12 (c) While the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United invalidates
13 restrictions on independent expenditures, the issue of whether limitations may
14 be placed on contributions to independent expenditure-only political
15 committees remains unsettled law so long as the Second Circuit Court or the
16 United States Supreme Court have not directly decided on the matter.
17 (d) It is indeed the purpose of this act to amend the State’s campaign
18 finance laws to place limitations on contributions accepted by independent
19 expenditure-only political committees.
20 (e) The State has a sufficiently important interest in limiting corruption in
21 our political system and asserts a substantial relation between the limitation of
