1 located in Vermont, that has a plant capacity of 2.2 MW or less, and that is
2 commissioned on or after September 30, 2009.
3 (c) Cumulative capacity. In accordance with this subsection, the
4 Commission shall issue standard offers to new standard offer plants until a
5 cumulative plant capacity amount of 127.5 227.5 MW is reached.
6 (1) Pace. Annually commencing April 1, 2013, the Commission shall
7 increase the cumulative plant capacity of the Standard Offer Program (the
8 annual increase) until the 127.5-MW 227.5-MW cumulative plant capacity of
9 this subsection is reached.
10 (A) Annual amounts. The amount of the annual increase shall be five
11 MW for the three years commencing April 1, 2013, 7.5 MW for the three years
12 commencing April 1, 2016, and 10 MW commencing April 1, 2019, and then
13 20 MW commencing April 1, 2026.
14 (B) Blocks. Each year, a portion of the annual increase shall be
15 reserved for new standard offer plants proposed by Vermont retail electricity
16 providers (the provider block), and the remainder shall be reserved for new
17 standard offer plants proposed by persons who are not providers (the
18 independent developer block).
19 (i) The portion of the annual increase reserved for the provider
20 block shall be 10 percent for the three years commencing April 1, 2013, 15
VT LEG #379367 v.3
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.57
2025 Page 3 of 8
1 percent for the three years commencing April 1, 2016, and 20 percent
2 commencing April 1, 2019.
3 (ii) If the provider block for a given year is not fully subscribed,
4 any unsubscribed capacity within that block shall be added to the annual
5 increase for each following year until that capacity is subscribed and shall be
6 made available to new standard offer plants proposed by persons who are not
7 providers.
8 (iii) If the independent developer block for a given year is not fully
9 subscribed, any unsubscribed capacity within that block shall be added to the
10 annual increase for each following year until that capacity is subscribed and:
11 (I) shall be made available to new standard offer plants
12 proposed by persons who are not providers; and
13 (II) may be made available to a provider following a written
14 request and specific proposal submitted to and approved by the Commission.
15 [Repealed.]
16 (C) Adjustment; greenhouse gas reduction credits. The Commission
17 shall adjust the annual increase to account for greenhouse gas reduction credits
18 by multiplying the annual increase by one minus the ratio of the prior year’s
19 greenhouse gas reduction credits to that year’s statewide retail electric sales.
VT LEG #379367 v.3
BILL AS INTRODUCED S.57
2025 Page 4 of 8

2 credits shall be determined in accordance with subdivision subsection 8006a(a)
3 of this title.
4 (ii) The adjustment in the annual increase shall be applied
5 proportionally to the independent developer block and the provider block.
6 (iii) Greenhouse gas reduction credits used to diminish a
7 provider’s obligation under section 8004 of this title may be used to adjust the
8 annual increase under this subsection (c).
9 * * *
10 (d) Plants outside cumulative capacity. The following categories of plants
11 shall not count toward the cumulative capacity amount of subsection (c) of this
12 section, and the Commission shall make standard offers available to them
13 provided that they are otherwise eligible for such offers under this section:
14 (1) Plants using methane derived from an agricultural operation.
15 (2) New standard offer plants that the Commission determines will have
16 sufficient benefits to the operation and management of the electric grid or a
17 provider’s portion thereof because of their design, characteristics, location, or
18 any other discernible benefit. To enhance the ability of new standard offer
19 plants to mitigate transmission and distribution constraints, the Commission
20 shall require Vermont retail electricity providers and companies that own or
21 operate electric transmission facilities within the State to make sufficient
VT LEG #379367 v.3

2 new standard offer plants.
3 (A) By March 1, 2013, the Commission shall develop a screening
4 framework or guidelines that will provide developers with adequate
5 information regarding constrained areas in which generation having particular
6 characteristics is reasonably likely to provide sufficient benefit to allow the
7 generation to qualify for eligibility under this subdivision (2).
8 (B) Once the Commission develops the screening framework or
9 guidelines under subdivision (2)(A) of this subsection (d), the Commission
10 shall require Vermont transmission and retail electricity providers to make the
11 necessary information publicly available in a timely manner, with updates at
12 least annually.

8 (1) Notwithstanding other provisions of this section to the contrary,
9 beginning on April 1, 2026, the Commission shall allocate the new standard
