No. R-45. House concurrent resolution honoring Charlotte Board of Civil Authority
Chair, and Ski and Ride Program Coordinator Michael Krasnow.
(H.C.R.36)
Offered by Representatives Waters Evans of Charlotte and Krasnow of South
Burlington
Whereas, for 27 years, Michael Krasnow has served the Town of Charlotte with
distinction, as a member of the municipality’s Board of Civil Authority (BCA), which
provides the town with tax adjudication and electoral administration support, and his
fellow panel members have elected him as the BCA’s chair, and
Whereas, in a different context, as the Charlotte Ski and Ride Program Coordinator,
Michael Krasnow has brought great joy to countless youngsters, and
Whereas, the genesis of this passion for introducing young persons to the slopes,
especially those who might never otherwise participate in skiing or snowboarding, began
at four years of age with family ski trips from his Long Island, New York, home to
Vermont, and
Whereas, during his earlier career as a public school teacher in the Boston,
Massachusetts, area, Michael Krasnow was an advisor for student noncompetitive skiing
activities that eventually involved 1,000 students, and
Whereas, in 1989, Michael Krasnow relocated his family to Vermont and volunteered
to assist the Ski and Ride Program at the Charlotte Central School, which brings students
to night skiing sessions at Bolton Valley Resort (Bolton), and within a year he was the
program’s leader, and
Whereas, during a five-week span starting in mid-February, he oversees the
participation of nearly 150 students traveling to Bolton, including approximately 20–25
new youngsters each winter, and for most of the students, the social experience is of
foremost importance, and
Whereas, associated with his ski and ride leadership role, Michael Krasnow has
overseen a ski and snowboard fitting and equipment distribution project, drawing on his
vast collection of primarily donated gear, that provides the essential elements of the sport
to area youngsters, and
Whereas, for over three decades, Michael Krasnow has enthusiastically introduced
countless youngsters in Charlotte to the joys of Vermont’s wintry slopes, now
therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly honors Charlotte Board of Civil Authority Chair, and Ski
and Ride Program Coordinator Michael Krasnow, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Michael Krasnow.
