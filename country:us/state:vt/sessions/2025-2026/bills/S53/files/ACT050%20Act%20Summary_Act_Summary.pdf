Act No. 50 (S.53). An act relating to certification of community-based perinatal doulas and
Medicaid coverage for doula services
Subjects: Medicaid; certification; professions and occupations; Office of
Professional Regulation; community-based perinatal doulas
This act creates a voluntary certification process for community-based perinatal doulas
through the Office of Professional Regulation and establishes a $75.00 application fee for
certification, with a $120.00 biennial renewal fee. The act requires the Department of
Vermont Health Access to reimburse certified community-based perinatal doulas for
providing direct emotional and physical support and educational and informational
services to Medicaid beneficiaries during pregnancy, labor and delivery, and the
postpartum period. The act expresses legislative intent that the reimbursement rates
should be reasonable and adequate for the services provided and be consistent with the
rates set by other statesâ€™ Medicaid programs and it directs the Department to seek a state
plan amendment from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services by July 1, 2026,
to allow Vermont Medicaid to cover doula services.
