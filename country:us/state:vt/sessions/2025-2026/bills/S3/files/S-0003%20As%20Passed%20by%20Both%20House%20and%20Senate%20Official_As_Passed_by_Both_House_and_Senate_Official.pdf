12 costs of administration of the settlor’s estate, the expenses of the settlor’s
13 funeral and disposal of remains, and statutory allowances to a surviving spouse
14 and children to the extent the settlor’s probate estate is inadequate to satisfy
15 those claims, costs, expenses, and allowances.

17 (c)(1) Property held by spouses as tenants by the entirety that is conveyed
18 to the spouses’ jointly or separately held revocable or irrevocable trusts, and
19 any proceeds of the sale or disposition of the property, shall be immune from
20 the claims of the spouses’ separate creditors to the same extent as the property

10 holds the entire property; or
11 (ii) each spouse is a current beneficiary of a separate trust and the
12 two separate trusts, together, hold the entire property, whether or not other
13 persons are also current or future beneficiaries of the trust or trusts.
14 (2)(A) Property at any time held in a tenants by the entirety trust shall
15 have the same immunity from the claims of a separate creditor of either settlor
16 as the property would have if it were held outside the trust by the settlors as
17 tenants by the entirety unless otherwise provided in writing by the settlor or
18 settlors who transferred the property to the trust. The property shall be treated
19 in all respects as tenants by the entirety property, including for purposes of
