3 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
4 Sec. 1. 14A V.S.A. § 505 is amended to read:
5 § 505. CREDITOR’S CLAIM AGAINST SETTLOR
6 (a) Whether or not the terms of a trust contain a spendthrift provision, the
7 following rules apply:
8 (1) During the lifetime of the settlor, the property of a revocable trust is
9 subject to claims of the settlor’s creditors.
10 (2) With respect to an irrevocable trust, a creditor or assignee of the
11 settlor may reach the maximum amount that can be distributed to or for the
12 settlor’s benefit. If a trust has more than one settlor, the amount the creditor or
13 assignee of a particular settlor may reach shall not exceed the settlor’s interest
14 in the portion of the trust attributable to that settlor’s contribution. This
15 subdivision shall not apply to an irrevocable “special needs trust” established
16 for a disabled person as described in 42 U.S.C. § 1396p(d)(4) or similar federal
17 law governing the transfer to such a trust.
18 (3) After the death of a settlor, and subject to the settlor’s right to direct
19 the source from which liabilities will be paid, the property of a trust that was
20 revocable at the settlor’s death is subject to claims of the settlor’s creditors,
21 costs of administration of the settlor’s estate, the expenses of the settlor’s

5 (c)(1) Property held by spouses as tenants by the entirety that is conveyed
6 to the spouses’ jointly or separately held revocable or irrevocable trusts, and
7 any proceeds of the sale or disposition of the property, shall be immune from
8 the claims of the spouses’ separate creditors to the same extent as the property
9 would have been if it had remained held by the spouses as tenants by the
10 entirety if the following apply:
11 (A) the spouses are married to each other;
12 (B) the property is held in the trust or trusts or has been deeded out of
13 the trust to the spouses as tenants by the entirety;
14 (C) if the trust is a joint trust, the trust may be revoked by either
15 spouse acting alone but may be amended only by action of both spouses; and
16 (D) the property is the spouses’ property; and
17 (E)(i) both spouses are current beneficiaries of one joint trust that
18 holds the entire property; or
19 (ii) each spouse is a current beneficiary of a separate trust and the
20 two separate trusts, together, hold the entire property, whether or not other
21 persons are also current or future beneficiaries of the trust or trusts.
