security for its loan a mortgage junior in lien to that of the federal agency.

Community Development and the Authority, shall adopt a Vermont sustainable
jobs strategy for the State, in accordance with the provisions of this section
Before issuing any funds to an eligible facility or eligible project under section
280a of this title, the Authority shall make a determination that the facility or
project materially supports one of the following objectives:
(A) creating or sustaining employment opportunities for Vermonters
in proportion to the amount of financial assistance requested;
(B) providing quality employment at wage and benefit levels
sufficient to permit a reasonable standard of living by community standards,
and at levels that may contribute to bringing Vermont’s average wage up to or
above 100 percent of the national average wage rate;
(C) promoting employment opportunities in economically
disadvantaged areas and communities in the State;
(D) advancing the overall growth of wealth in the Vermont economy
by promoting the production and sale of goods and services with a substantial
Vermont content and those that utilize Vermont’s unique human and natural
resource base to markets outside of the State and nation, including visitors to,
and travelers through, the State;
(E) assisting the development of a business infrastructure that will
contribute to sustainable economic development, to include the provision of

and maintenance, technical services, distribution, and dependent care,
particularly when intrastate capability in these areas can replace services
currently provided by out-of-state suppliers;
(F) encouraging economic development projects that reduce,
mitigate, or eliminate the effects of climate change, the pollution of land, air,
or water, or those that will interdict material within the State that, having
served its intended purpose, would otherwise enter the solid waste disposal
stream and that will cause the diversion of such material to useful purposes, or
that will reuse or recycle any such post-consumer material;
(G) encouraging commercial activity in the traditional downtown
areas of the State and promoting through appropriate commercial adaptation
the preservation of suitable buildings or structures that are historically or
aesthetically significant;
(H) encouraging economic development projects that are consistent
with and sensitive to the needs of the communities in which such projects are
located;

that are the small businesses of today will be the large employers of tomorrow;

business growth strategies adopted by the Vermont Economic Progress Council
and the Vermont Department of Economic Development, wherever possible
providing assistance to those categories of enterprise that may be designated
as especially desirable for Vermont.
(2) All determinations and findings made by the Authority pursuant to
this section shall be conclusive.
(b)(1) The Vermont sustainable jobs strategy shall contain the criteria upon
which the Authority shall develop, modify, and implement its public financing
programs, and the criteria for determining whether investments should be
made in an eligible project. Such criteria shall include a requirement that,
before making any investment or other financial commitment, the Authority
shall determine that the proposed project is of public use and benefit and is
without unreasonable risk of loss to the Authority.
(2) In adopting the Vermont sustainable jobs strategy, the Governor
shall consider:
(A) the policies established in section 280 of this title; and
(B) the economic policy and economic development plan of the State,
as developed by the Economic Progress Council under subchapter 3 of chapter

2025 Page 60 of 65
specific standards by which to measure the extent to which any proposed
project meets the requirements of this section.
(c)(1) Before adopting the Vermont sustainable jobs strategy, the Governor
shall direct the Authority and the Secretary of Commerce and Community
Development to solicit information and recommendations from the people and
businesses of the State.
(2) After soliciting information and recommendations, the Authority and
the Secretary shall jointly develop a proposed Vermont sustainable jobs
strategy. In developing a proposed strategy, the Authority and the Secretary
shall consider how best to integrate Vermont’s economic, social, and
environmental values into a Vermont sustainable jobs strategy. The Authority
and the Secretary shall jointly present their proposed strategy to the House
Committee on Commerce and the Senate Committee on Economic
Development, Housing and General Affairs meeting in joint hearing.
(3) After legislative presentation, the Authority and the Secretary may
amend the proposed strategy, and shall present the proposed strategy as
amended to the Governor. The Governor may adopt the proposed strategy, or
may return the proposed strategy to the Authority and the Secretary for further
development and legislative presentation. After adoption of the Vermont
sustainable jobs strategy, any amendments to the strategy may be adopted by
the Governor in accordance with the process established by this section In

project to the State and to the community in which it is proposed to be located,
the amount of assistance requested, and the availability of Authority resources
to fund the request.
