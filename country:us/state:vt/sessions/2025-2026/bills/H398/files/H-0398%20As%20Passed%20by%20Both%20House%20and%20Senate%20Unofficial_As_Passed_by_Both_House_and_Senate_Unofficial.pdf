16 addition, the Authority shall have determined that the mortgagor obligor has
17 obtained from other independent and responsible sources, such as banks and
18 insurance companies financial institutions or otherwise, a firm commitment for
19 all other funds, over and above the loan of the Authority and such funds or
20 property as the local development corporation may hold, necessary for

10 commitment of funds from the independent and responsible sources and used
11 in the financing of the economic development project. Monies loaned by the
12 Authority shall be withdrawn from the Vermont Jobs Fund and paid over to the
13 mortgagor obligor in such manner as provided and prescribed by the rules and
14 regulations of the Authority. All payments of principal and interest on the
15 loans shall be deposited by the Authority in the Vermont Jobs Fund.
16 (c) Loans by the Authority for an eligible facility under this subchapter

8 § 264. ACCELERATED REPAYMENT PROVISIONS
9 Any direct mortgage loan made on or after July 1, 1988 under this
10 subchapter shall be conditioned upon the maintenance of a reasonable level of
11 employment at the facility or facilities owned by the mortgagor obligor and
12 pledged as security for the loan. For the purposes of this section, a reasonable
13 level of employment shall be deemed not to have been maintained whenever a
14 mortgagor an obligor employing 50 or more employees at such facility or
15 facilities permanently transfers, within any three-year period, 50 percent or
16 more of those employees or employment positions to any out-of-state facility.
17 Upon breach of this condition, the Authority may declare all principal and
18 interest of the mortgage loan immediately due and payable and may commence
19 foreclosure on any property held as security for the mortgage loan or take any
20 other lawful steps to obtain payment.
