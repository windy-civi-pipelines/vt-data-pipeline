current home
Whereas, a public library is a cultural, literary, and informational resource that enlightens and
enriches a community, and this is certainly true in the Town of Putney, where the library’s
centuries of institutional history represent continuity and strength, and
Whereas, the citizens of Putney established their town’s library in 1793, proceeded to
incorporate it in 1800, appropriated municipal funds to this newly designated public library in
1896, and allocated town hall space for the facility starting in 1908, and
Whereas, across the decades, the Putney Library has been located at a minimum of six
different locations, and its current home, opened on January 5, 2005, came to fruition due to the
championship of Putney resident David Rothchild, whose vision inspired the community to raise
the necessary funds, mostly from town residents, in order to construct an attractive locally
designed and built facility at 55 Main Street, and
Whereas, the Putney Library serves the community’s 2,600 residents, as well as patrons from
surrounding towns, and it provides a safe and welcoming space that offers activities and
programs for persons of all ages and interests, and
Whereas, as an educational center, the Putney Library offers lifelong learning opportunities,
free and comprehensive computer service with 24/7 Wi-Fi access, and the space and
opportunities for local artists to exhibit and present lectures explaining their creations, and
Whereas, the knowledgeable and congenial staff is most helpful and fosters community
connection, and the library continues to serve Putney proudly and with sincere dedication, now
therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the Putney Library on the 20th anniversary of its
current home, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the
Putney Library.
