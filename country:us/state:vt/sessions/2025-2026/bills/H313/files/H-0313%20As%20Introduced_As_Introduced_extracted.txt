1 § 2706. TYPE OF RANKED-CHOICE VOTING
2 (a) At least 150 days before the date of the presidential primary election,
3 the State committee of each major political party shall confirm in writing with
4 the Secretary of State whether the party will award delegates either:
5 (1) on a winner-take-all basis in accordance with subsection 2707(d) of
6 this title; or
7 (2) on a proportional basis in accordance with subsection 2707(e) of this
8 title, in which case the party shall also indicate the applicable threshold or
9 thresholds for receiving delegates.
10 (b) If a party fails to provide notice, or its notice does not specify how the
11 party will award its delegates, the presidential primary election for that party
12 shall be tabulated on a winner-take-all basis in accordance with subsection
13 2707(d) of this title.
14 § 2707. RANKED-CHOICE VOTING TABULATION
15 (a) Tabulation rounds. In any presidential primary election for a major
16 political party, each ballot shall count as one vote for the highest-ranked active
17 candidate on that ballot. Tabulation shall proceed in rounds. Each round
18 proceeds sequentially as described in subsection (d) or (e) of this section, as
19 applicable.
20 (b) Withdrawn candidates. If a candidate withdraws, dies, or for any
21 reason becomes disqualified after the ballots have been printed, the candidate
VT LEG #380888 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.313
2025 Page 9 of 14
1 shall be treated as an eliminated candidate during tabulation unless a ranking
2 for that candidate is to be counted pursuant to party rule.
3 (c) Treatment of ballots.
4 (1) An undervote is a ballot that does not rank any candidates in an
5 election for a particular office. An undervote does not count as an active or
6 inactive ballot in any round of tabulation of that election.
7 (2) An inactive ballot is a ballot that ceases during tabulation to count
8 for any candidate for the remainder of tabulation of the election for that office
9 because either:
10 (A) All candidates ranked on the ballot have become inactive.
11 (B) The ballot includes an overvote and any candidates ranked higher
12 than the overvote have become inactive. An overvote occurs when a voter
13 ranks more than one candidate at the same ranking.
14 (3) During tabulation, a ballot shall remain active and continue to count
15 for its highest-ranked active candidate notwithstanding any skipped or repeated
16 rankings on the ballot. A skipped ranking occurs when a voter leaves a
17 ranking unassigned but ranks a candidate at a subsequent ranking. A repeated
18 ranking occurs when a voter ranks the same candidate at multiple rankings.
19 (d) Award of delegates on winner-take-all basis. If a major political party
20 awards all of the State’s delegates to a single candidate on a winner-take-all
21 basis, tabulation shall proceed as follows:
VT LEG #380888 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.313
2025 Page 10 of 14
1 (1) If there are two or fewer active candidates, then tabulation is
2 complete and the candidate with the most votes is declared the winner of the
3 election.
4 (2) If there are more than two active candidates, the active candidate
5 with the fewest votes is eliminated, the votes for the eliminated candidate are
6 transferred to each ballot’s next-ranked active candidate, and a new round
7 begins.
8 (3) If there is a tie between two active candidates with the fewest votes,
9 the tie shall be resolved by lot to determine which candidate is defeated. The
10 result of the tie resolution must be recorded and reused in the event of a
11 recount.
12 (4) If there is a tie between the final two active candidates, the Secretary
13 of State shall notify each active candidate involved in the tie, or the candidate’s
14 designee, to be present at the Secretary of State’s office at a certain time. At
15 that time, the Secretary of State shall select the winner of the tabulation by lot.
16 (e) Award of delegates on proportional basis. If a major political party
17 awards the State’s delegates to multiple candidates on a proportional basis,
18 tabulation shall proceed as follows:
19 (1) If the vote total of every active candidate is above the threshold for
20 receiving delegates as confirmed by the major political party pursuant to
21 subdivision 2706(a)(2) of this title, then tabulation is complete.
VT LEG #380888 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.313
2025 Page 11 of 14
1 (2) If any active candidate is below the threshold for receiving
2 delegates, then the active candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, votes
3 for the eliminated candidate are transferred to each ballot’s next-ranked active
4 candidate, and a new round begins.
5 (3) If there is a tie between two active candidates with the fewest votes
6 and tabulation is not yet complete, the tie shall be resolved by lot to determine
7 which candidate is defeated. The result of the tie resolution must be recorded
8 and reused in the event of a recount.
9 (f) Certification of tabulation rounds. The Secretary of State shall certify
10 the results of each round tabulated pursuant to subsection (d) or (e) of this
11 section, as applicable, along with any other information required under section
12 2708 of this title, to the State chairperson and the national committee of each
13 major political party that had at least one candidate on the State-administered
14 presidential primary election ballot to allocate national delegate votes in
15 accordance with the party’s State and national rules.
16 (g) Priority of major political party rules. Nothing in this subchapter shall
17 be construed to preclude a major political party from allocating delegates
18 according to its own rules for allocating such delegates.

1 § 2704 2705. RANKED-CHOICE VOTING; BALLOTS
2 (a) A presidential primary election for a major political party shall be
3 conducted by ranked-choice voting.
4 (b) A person voting at the primary shall be required to ask for the ranked-
5 choice ballot of the party in which the voter wishes to vote, and an election
6 official shall record the voter’s choice of ballot by marking the entrance
7 checklist with a letter code, as designated by the Secretary of State, to indicate
8 the voter’s party choice.
9 (1) The ballot shall allow voters to rank candidates in order of choice.
10 The names of all candidates on the ballot shall be listed in alphabetical order.
11 Each voter may vote for one candidate for the presidential nomination of one
12 party, either by placing a mark opposite the printed name of a candidate as in
13 other primaries, or by writing in the name of the candidate of the voter’s
14 choice.
15 (2) The ballot shall allow voters to assign rankings to candidates that are
16 equal to the number of printed candidate names and blank write-in lines,
17 except to the extent established by the Secretary pursuant to section 2710 of
18 this title.

1 § 2706. TYPE OF RANKED-CHOICE VOTING
2 (a) At least 150 days before the date of the presidential primary election,
3 the State committee of each major political party shall confirm in writing with
4 the Secretary of State whether the party will award delegates either:
5 (1) on a winner-take-all basis in accordance with subsection 2707(d) of
6 this title; or
7 (2) on a proportional basis in accordance with subsection 2707(e) of this
8 title, in which case the party shall also indicate the applicable threshold or
9 thresholds for receiving delegates.
10 (b) If a party fails to provide notice, or its notice does not specify how the
11 party will award its delegates, the presidential primary election for that party
12 shall be tabulated on a winner-take-all basis in accordance with subsection
13 2707(d) of this title.
14 § 2707. RANKED-CHOICE VOTING TABULATION
15 (a) Tabulation rounds. In any presidential primary election for a major
16 political party, each ballot shall count as one vote for the highest-ranked active
17 candidate on that ballot. Tabulation shall proceed in rounds. Each round
18 proceeds sequentially as described in subsection (d) or (e) of this section, as
19 applicable.
20 (b) Withdrawn candidates. If a candidate withdraws, dies, or for any
21 reason becomes disqualified after the ballots have been printed, the candidate
VT LEG #380888 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.313
2025 Page 9 of 14
1 shall be treated as an eliminated candidate during tabulation unless a ranking
2 for that candidate is to be counted pursuant to party rule.
3 (c) Treatment of ballots.
4 (1) An undervote is a ballot that does not rank any candidates in an
5 election for a particular office. An undervote does not count as an active or
6 inactive ballot in any round of tabulation of that election.
7 (2) An inactive ballot is a ballot that ceases during tabulation to count
8 for any candidate for the remainder of tabulation of the election for that office
9 because either:
10 (A) All candidates ranked on the ballot have become inactive.
11 (B) The ballot includes an overvote and any candidates ranked higher
12 than the overvote have become inactive. An overvote occurs when a voter
13 ranks more than one candidate at the same ranking.
14 (3) During tabulation, a ballot shall remain active and continue to count
15 for its highest-ranked active candidate notwithstanding any skipped or repeated
16 rankings on the ballot. A skipped ranking occurs when a voter leaves a
17 ranking unassigned but ranks a candidate at a subsequent ranking. A repeated
18 ranking occurs when a voter ranks the same candidate at multiple rankings.
19 (d) Award of delegates on winner-take-all basis. If a major political party
20 awards all of the State’s delegates to a single candidate on a winner-take-all
21 basis, tabulation shall proceed as follows:
VT LEG #380888 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.313
2025 Page 10 of 14
1 (1) If there are two or fewer active candidates, then tabulation is
2 complete and the candidate with the most votes is declared the winner of the
3 election.
4 (2) If there are more than two active candidates, the active candidate
5 with the fewest votes is eliminated, the votes for the eliminated candidate are
6 transferred to each ballot’s next-ranked active candidate, and a new round
7 begins.
8 (3) If there is a tie between two active candidates with the fewest votes,
9 the tie shall be resolved by lot to determine which candidate is defeated. The
10 result of the tie resolution must be recorded and reused in the event of a
11 recount.
12 (4) If there is a tie between the final two active candidates, the Secretary
13 of State shall notify each active candidate involved in the tie, or the candidate’s
14 designee, to be present at the Secretary of State’s office at a certain time. At
15 that time, the Secretary of State shall select the winner of the tabulation by lot.
16 (e) Award of delegates on proportional basis. If a major political party
17 awards the State’s delegates to multiple candidates on a proportional basis,
18 tabulation shall proceed as follows:
19 (1) If the vote total of every active candidate is above the threshold for
20 receiving delegates as confirmed by the major political party pursuant to
21 subdivision 2706(a)(2) of this title, then tabulation is complete.
VT LEG #380888 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.313
2025 Page 11 of 14
1 (2) If any active candidate is below the threshold for receiving
2 delegates, then the active candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, votes
3 for the eliminated candidate are transferred to each ballot’s next-ranked active
4 candidate, and a new round begins.
5 (3) If there is a tie between two active candidates with the fewest votes
6 and tabulation is not yet complete, the tie shall be resolved by lot to determine
7 which candidate is defeated. The result of the tie resolution must be recorded
8 and reused in the event of a recount.
9 (f) Certification of tabulation rounds. The Secretary of State shall certify
10 the results of each round tabulated pursuant to subsection (d) or (e) of this
11 section, as applicable, along with any other information required under section
12 2708 of this title, to the State chairperson and the national committee of each
13 major political party that had at least one candidate on the State-administered
14 presidential primary election ballot to allocate national delegate votes in
15 accordance with the party’s State and national rules.
16 (g) Priority of major political party rules. Nothing in this subchapter shall
17 be construed to preclude a major political party from allocating delegates
18 according to its own rules for allocating such delegates.

3 as feasible after the polls close and at regular intervals thereafter until the
4 counting of ballots is complete.
5 (b) Unofficial preliminary ballot-level ranking data shall be made public in
6 a machine-readable and searchable open format not later than when the

12 district, round-by-round results by geographical unit or district shall be made
13 public in addition to statewide results.
14 § 2709. CANVASSING COMMITTEE CERTIFICATES
15 When the canvassing committee provided for in section 2592 of this title

17 major political party, the canvass shall state the number of final round votes
18 received by each candidate who has received votes in the final round of
19 tabulation.
