House of Representatives
Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 102
of Colchester
Offered by Senators Norris and Brennan
House concurrent resolution congratulating the 2024 8–10 Colchester All-Star Vermont championship Little
League Baseball team
Whereas, for the 2024 8–10 Colchester All-Star Little League Baseball team, the phrases “come from
behind” and “never say no” ring true, and
Whereas, this fine squad of young players had previously proven their dedication to the game of baseball
upon being selected as all-stars, and
Whereas, Colchester’s first challenge was to advance in the District 1 competition in which the team twice
defeated its rival contender, Camel’s Hump, 21–8 and then 10–4 for the divisional title, notwithstanding two
earlier Camel’s Hump victories over Colchester, and
Whereas, in the State championship contest, Colchester was matched against the host Brattleboro team, and
in the bottom of the seventh of a scheduled seven-inning contest with two outs, no runner on base, and trailing
4–2, Colchester ignited an unanticipated offensive spree, scoring three successive and decisive runs,
triumphantly departing the diamond as the 5–4 game winner and the 2024 8–10 Vermont Little League
champion, and
Whereas, Colchester represented Vermont admirably at the New England regional Little League Baseball
tournament played in Rhode Island, and
Whereas, the proud Colchester All-Star Little League players were Boden Carney, Grayson Carey, Elliot
Cote, Hayden Critchlow, Weston Ellingson, Willie Lamarche, Graysen Mead, Keegan Norris, Oliver Ouellette,
Easton Pratt, Toby Scheuch, and Jensen Yelk, and
Whereas, head coaches Brennan Carney, Ty Pratt, and Jason Yelk served as outstanding mentors and teachers
for the team, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2024 8–10 Colchester All-Star Vermont championship Little
League Baseball team, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the 8–10 Colchester
All-Star Vermont Little League Baseball team.
