Star Vermont championship Little League Baseball team.
(H.C.R.102)
Offered by Representatives Austin of Colchester, Bishop of Colchester, Critchlow of
Colchester, and Pezzo of Colchester
Offered by Senators Norris and Brennan
Whereas, for the 2024 8–10 Colchester All-Star Little League Baseball team, the
phrases “come from behind” and “never say no” ring true, and
Whereas, this fine squad of young players had previously proven their dedication to
the game of baseball upon being selected as all-stars, and
Whereas, Colchester’s first challenge was to advance in the District 1 competition in
which the team twice defeated its rival contender, Camel’s Hump, 21–8 and then 10–4
for the divisional title, notwithstanding two earlier Camel’s Hump victories over
Colchester, and
Whereas, in the State championship contest, Colchester was matched against the host
Brattleboro team, and in the bottom of the seventh of a scheduled seven-inning contest
with two outs, no runner on base, and trailing 4–2, Colchester ignited an unanticipated
offensive spree, scoring three successive and decisive runs, triumphantly departing the
diamond as the 5–4 game winner and the 2024 8–10 Vermont Little League
champion, and
Whereas, Colchester represented Vermont admirably at the New England regional
Little League Baseball tournament played in Rhode Island, and
Whereas, the proud Colchester All-Star Little League players were Boden Carney,
Grayson Carey, Elliot Cote, Hayden Critchlow, Weston Ellingson, Willie Lamarche,
Graysen Mead, Keegan Norris, Oliver Ouellette, Easton Pratt, Toby Scheuch, and Jensen
Yelk, and
Whereas, head coaches Brennan Carney, Ty Pratt, and Jason Yelk served as
outstanding mentors and teachers for the team, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2024 8–10 Colchester All-Star Vermont
championship Little League Baseball team, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the 8–10 Colchester All-Star Vermont Little League Baseball team.
