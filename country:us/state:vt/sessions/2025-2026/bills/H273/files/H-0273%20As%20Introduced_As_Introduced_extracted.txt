7 (a) Land that has been classified as agricultural land or managed forestland

9 development of that land, as defined in section 3752 of this chapter. The tax
10 shall be at the rate of 10 six percent of the full fair market value of the changed
11 land determined without regard to the use value appraisal. If changed land is a
12 portion of a parcel, the fair market value of the changed land shall be the fair
13 market value of the changed land as a separate parcel, divided by the common
14 level of appraisal. Such fair market value shall be determined as of the date
15 the land is no longer eligible for use value appraisal. This tax shall be in
16 addition to the annual property tax imposed upon such property. Nothing in
17 this section shall be construed to require payment of an additional land use
18 change tax upon the subsequent development of the same land, nor shall it be
19 construed to require payment of a land use change tax merely because
20 previously eligible land becomes ineligible, provided no development of the
21 land has occurred.
