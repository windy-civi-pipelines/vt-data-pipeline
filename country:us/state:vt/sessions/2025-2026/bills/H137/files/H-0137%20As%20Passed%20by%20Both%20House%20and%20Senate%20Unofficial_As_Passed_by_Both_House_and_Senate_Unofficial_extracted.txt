21 insurance company, hospital or medical service organization, or health
VT LEG #383481 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.137
2025 Page 28 of 55
1 maintenance organization issuing the policy, the Department shall post

3 (1) the name of the health insurance company, hospital or medical
4 service organization, or health maintenance organization requesting the rate
5 increase;
6 (2) the overall composite average rate increase requested;
7 (3) the increase requested by plan type;
8 (4) the date on which the proposed increase would take effect;
9 (5) the System for Electronic Rate and Form Filing (SERFF) tracking
10 number associated with the filing and a web address for accessing the filing
11 electronically; and
12 (6) instructions for submitting public comments and the deadline for
13 doing so.
14 (b) Within five business days of after receiving a request for approval of
15 any composite average rate increase in excess of three 10 percent, or any other
16 coverage changes which that the Commissioner determines will have a
17 comparable impact on cost or availability of coverage for a Medicare
18 supplemental supplement insurance policy issued by any group or nongroup
19 health insurance company, hospital or medical service organization, or health
20 maintenance organization, with 5,000 or more total lives in the Vermont
21 Medicare supplement insurance market, the Commissioner shall notify the
VT LEG #383481 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.137
2025 Page 29 of 55
1 Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent Living and the Office of
2 the Health Care Advocate of the proposed premium increase. A composite
3 average rate is the enrollment-weighted average rate increase of all plans
4 offered by a carrier.
5 (b)(c) Within five business days after receiving notification pursuant to
6 subsection (a)(b) of this section, the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and
7 Independent Living shall inform the members of the Advisory Board
8 established pursuant to 33 V.S.A. § 505 of the proposed premium increase.
9 (c)(d)(1) The Commissioner shall not approve any request to increase
10 Medicare supplemental supplement insurance premium rates unless the amount
11 of the rate increase complies with the statutory standards for approval under
12 sections 4062, 4513, 4584, and 5104 of this title. Any approved rate increase
13 shall not be based on an unreasonable change in loss ratio from the previous

15 necessary to prevent a substantial adverse impact on the financial condition of
16 the insurer. In acting on such rate increase requests, the Commissioner may
17 deny the request, approve the rate increase as requested, or approve a rate
18 increase in an amount different from the increase requested. A decision by the
19 Commissioner other than an approval of the rate requested may be appealed by
20 the insurer, provided that the burden of proof shall be on the insurer to show
VT LEG #383481 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.137
2025 Page 30 of 55
1 that the approved rate does not meet the statutory standards established under
2 this subsection.

8 independent analysis has been performed pursuant to 33 V.S.A. § 6706 and
9 wherein the carrier’s requested composite average increase, the independent
10 expert’s recommended composite average rate increase, or the Department
11 actuary’s recommended composite average rate increase differ by two
12 percentage points or more, the Commissioner shall hold a public hearing where
13 the insurer, the Department’s actuary, the independent expert, any intervenor,
14 and the public will have the opportunity to present written and oral testimony
15 and will be available to answer questions of the Commissioner and those
16 present. The hearing shall be noticed and held at a time and place so as to
17 facilitate public participation, and shall be recorded and become part of the
18 record before the Commissioner. In the Commissioner’s discretion, the
19 hearing may be conducted through interactive. If the carrier’s requested
20 composite average increase, the independent expert’s recommended composite
21 average increase, or the Department actuary’s recommended composite
VT LEG #383481 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.137
2025 Page 31 of 55
1 average increase differs by less than two percentage points, the Department
2 and the parties shall confer by conference call, or by any other available media,
3 to review the rate requests and recommendations. However, a public hearing
4 may be held at the Commissioner’s discretion for good cause shown.
5 (A) For any filing by a health insurance company, hospital or medical
6 service organization, or health maintenance organization with 5,000 or more
7 total lives in the Vermont Medicare supplement insurance market in which the
8 requested composite average rate increase exceeds 10 percent, the
9 Commissioner shall:
10 (i) solicit public comment; and
11 (ii) hold a public hearing in accordance with the Department of
12 Financial Regulation’s applicable rules regarding administrative procedures if,
13 not later than 30 days after the rate filing information is posted on the

15 requested by the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent Living;
16 by the Office of the Health Care Advocate; or by not fewer than 25
17 policyholders whose premium rates would be affected by the requested rate
18 increase.
19 (B) For any filing that does not meet the criteria specified in
20 subdivision (A) of this subdivision (3), a public hearing may be held in the
21 Commissioner’s discretion.
VT LEG #383481 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.137
2025 Page 32 of 55
1 (C) In the Commissioner’s discretion, a hearing held pursuant to this
2 subdivision (3) may be conducted through a designated electronic meeting
3 platform.
4 (4) In any review held in accordance with this subsection, the
5 Commissioner shall permit intervention by any person that the Commissioner
6 determines will materially advance the interests of the insured individuals.
7 The intervenor shall have access to, and may use the information of the
8 independent expert appointed under 33 V.S.A. § 6706. The reasonable and
9 necessary cost of intervention as determined by the Commissioner shall be
10 paid by the affected policyholders or certificate holders. The maximum
11 payment shall be $2,500.00 except when waived by the Commissioner for
12 good cause shown. The $2,500.00 maximum amount may be adjusted to
13 reflect, at the Commissioner’s discretion, appropriate inflation factors. In any
14 review held in accordance with this section, the Commissioner shall permit
15 intervention by any person whom the Commissioner determines will materially
16 advance the interests of the individuals insured under the policy.
17 (5) Nonproprietary, relevant information in any Medicare supplement
18 rate filing, including any analysis by the Department’s actuary and the
19 independent expert, shall be made available to the public upon request.
20 (e) For a Medicare supplement insurance policy with an effective date of
21 January 1, the insurer shall file its premium rate request pursuant to this section
VT LEG #383481 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.137
2025 Page 33 of 55
1 not later than July 1 of the preceding year. For a Medicare supplement

VT LEG #383481 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.137
2025 Page 43 of 55
1 Did you receive a phone call from your bank, software provider, the police,
2 or were you directed to make a payment for Social Security, a utility bill, an
3 investment, warrants, or bail money at this kiosk? STOP
4 Is anyone on the phone pressuring you to make a payment of any kind?
5 STOP
6 I understand that the purchase and sale of cryptocurrency may be a final,
7 irreversible, and nonrefundable transaction.

9 control over. I confirm that I am using funds gained from my own initiative to
10 make my transaction.

VT LEG #383481 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.137
2025 Page 44 of 55
1 (2) Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the State, federal, or
2 international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value
3 of virtual currency.
4 (3) Transactions in virtual currency may be irreversible and,
5 accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be
6 recoverable.
7 (4) Some virtual-currency transactions shall be deemed to be made
8 when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that
9 the customer initiates the transaction.
10 (5) The value of virtual currency may be derived from the continued
11 willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for virtual
12 currency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of
13 value of a particular virtual currency should the market for that virtual
14 currency disappear.
15 (6) There is no assurance that a person who accepts a virtual currency as
16 payment today will continue to do so in the future.
17 (7) The volatility and unpredictability of the price of virtual currency
18 relative to fiat currency may result in significant loss over a short period of
19 time.
20 (8) The nature of virtual currency may lead to an increased risk of fraud
21 or cyber attack.
VT LEG #383481 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.137
2025 Page 45 of 55
1 (9) The nature of virtual currency means that any technological
2 difficulties experienced by the virtual-currency kiosk operator may prevent the
3 access or use of a customer’s virtual currency.
4 (10) Any bond or trust account maintained by the virtual-currency kiosk
5 operator for the benefit of its customers may not be sufficient to cover all
6 losses incurred by customers.
7 Sec. 24. 8 V.S.A. § 2577 is amended to read:
8 § 2577. VIRTUAL-CURRENCY KIOSK OPERATORS
9 (a) Daily transaction limit.

11 (d) Licensing requirement. A virtual-currency kiosk operator shall comply
12 with the licensing requirements of this subchapter to the extent that the virtual-

15 facilitates another person to engage in virtual-currency business activity via a
16 money transmission virtual-currency kiosk in this State that is owned,
17 operated, or managed by the virtual-currency kiosk operator, the virtual-
18 currency kiosk operator shall do all of the following:
19 (1) ensure that the person engaging in virtual-currency business activity
20 is licensed under subchapter 2 of this chapter to engage in virtual-currency

13 Regulation shall report to the House Committee on Commerce and Economic
14 Development and the Senate Committee on Finance on whether the
15 requirements of this section coupled with relevant federal requirements are
16 sufficient to protect customers in Vermont from fraudulent activity. If deemed
17 necessary and appropriate by the Commissioner, the Commissioner may make
18 recommendations for additional statutory or regulatory safeguards. In
19 addition, the Commissioner shall make recommendations for enhanced
20 oversight and monitoring of virtual-currency kiosks for the purpose of
21 minimizing their use for illicit activities as described in the U.S. Government

6 (2) the overall composite average rate increase requested;
7 (3) the increase requested by plan type;

14 (b) Within five business days of after receiving a request for approval of

17 comparable impact on cost or availability of coverage for a Medicare
18 supplemental supplement insurance policy issued by any group or nongroup
19 health insurance company, hospital or medical service organization, or health
20 maintenance organization, with 5,000 or more total lives in the Vermont

5 (b)(c) Within five business days after receiving notification pursuant to
6 subsection (a)(b) of this section, the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and
7 Independent Living shall inform the members of the Advisory Board
8 established pursuant to 33 V.S.A. § 505 of the proposed premium increase.

15 necessary to prevent a substantial adverse impact on the financial condition of
16 the insurer. In acting on such rate increase requests, the Commissioner may
17 deny the request, approve the rate increase as requested, or approve a rate
18 increase in an amount different from the increase requested. A decision by the
19 Commissioner other than an approval of the rate requested may be appealed by
20 the insurer, provided that the burden of proof shall be on the insurer to show
VT LEG #383481 v.1

9 wherein the carrier’s requested composite average increase, the independent
10 expert’s recommended composite average rate increase, or the Department
11 actuary’s recommended composite average rate increase differ by two
12 percentage points or more, the Commissioner shall hold a public hearing where
13 the insurer, the Department’s actuary, the independent expert, any intervenor,
14 and the public will have the opportunity to present written and oral testimony
15 and will be available to answer questions of the Commissioner and those
16 present. The hearing shall be noticed and held at a time and place so as to
17 facilitate public participation, and shall be recorded and become part of the
18 record before the Commissioner. In the Commissioner’s discretion, the
19 hearing may be conducted through interactive. If the carrier’s requested
20 composite average increase, the independent expert’s recommended composite
21 average increase, or the Department actuary’s recommended composite

2 and the parties shall confer by conference call, or by any other available media,
3 to review the rate requests and recommendations. However, a public hearing
4 may be held at the Commissioner’s discretion for good cause shown.
5 (A) For any filing by a health insurance company, hospital or medical
6 service organization, or health maintenance organization with 5,000 or more

6 determines will materially advance the interests of the insured individuals.
7 The intervenor shall have access to, and may use the information of the
8 independent expert appointed under 33 V.S.A. § 6706. The reasonable and
9 necessary cost of intervention as determined by the Commissioner shall be
10 paid by the affected policyholders or certificate holders. The maximum
11 payment shall be $2,500.00 except when waived by the Commissioner for
12 good cause shown. The $2,500.00 maximum amount may be adjusted to
13 reflect, at the Commissioner’s discretion, appropriate inflation factors. In any
14 review held in accordance with this section, the Commissioner shall permit
15 intervention by any person whom the Commissioner determines will materially
16 advance the interests of the individuals insured under the policy.

18 rate filing, including any analysis by the Department’s actuary and the
19 independent expert, shall be made available to the public upon request.
