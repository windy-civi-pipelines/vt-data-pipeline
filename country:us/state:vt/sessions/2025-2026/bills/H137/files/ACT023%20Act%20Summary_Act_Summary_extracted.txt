is intended to provide a general summary of the act and may not be exhaustive. It has been prepared by the
staff of the Office of Legislative Counsel without input from members of the General Assembly. It is not
intended to aid in the interpretation of legislation or to serve as a source of legislative intent.
Act No. 23 (H.137). An act relating to the regulation of insurance products and services
Subjects: Insurance; captive insurance; property and casualty insurance; money
transmission licenses; interest rate caps; banking transaction holds; coerced debt;
genetic privacy; Medigap rates; virtual-currency kiosks; mutual savings bank
governance
This act makes numerous amendments to Vermont law as it pertains to insurance,
banking, and money transmission. In addition to numerous housekeeping amendments,
the insurance provisions concern the following subjects: property and casualty rate
regulation in competitive markets; unfair insurance trade practices related to affordable
housing; capitalization, formation, merger, reinsurance, and governance requirements
applicable to captive insurance companies and risk retention groups; and regulatory
requirements applicable to Medicare supplement insurance rates.
In addition, the act exempts certain payroll processors from having to obtain a money
transmission license; expands the scope of “permitted charges” not subject to statutory
interest rate caps to include “discount points,” (i.e., prepaid interest), and requires
enhanced protections for depositors of mutual savings banks, particularly with respect to
governance and the fiduciary duties of corporators.
Regarding the regulation of virtual-currency kiosks, the act extends by one additional
year the moratorium on new virtual-currency kiosks in Vermont, which was set to expire
on July 1, 2025. It also imposes additional consumer protections applicable to the
existing virtual-currency kiosks currently operating in Vermont. These consumer
protections include the following: enhanced consumer disclosures and warnings;
customer identification requirements; live customer support; mandatory live screenings
for certain customers; blockchain analytics to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions;
and full refunds for new customers and fee refunds for existing customers in the event of
fraudulent activity. Also, the act increases the daily transaction limits for new customers
and existing customers and increases the statutory transaction fee cap that a virtual-
currency kiosk operator may impose.
Finally, the act requires the Commissioner of Financial Regulation to conduct three in-
house studies related to the following topics: enhanced authority for banks to protect
account holders from suspected fraudulent activity by imposing transaction holds;
protections for victims of coerce debt; and genetic privacy in the insurance context,
particularly regarding genetic data obtained by direct-to-consumer companies, such as
those that conduct ancestry DNA testing.
