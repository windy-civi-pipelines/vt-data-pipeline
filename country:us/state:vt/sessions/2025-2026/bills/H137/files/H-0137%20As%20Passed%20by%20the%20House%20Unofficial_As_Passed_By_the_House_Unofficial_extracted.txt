6 INSURANCE RATE REVIEW
7 (a) Within five business days after receiving any request to increase the

9 insurance company, hospital or medical service organization, or health
10 maintenance organization issuing the policy, the Department shall post
11 information about the rate filing on the Department’s website, including:

13 service organization, or health maintenance organization requesting the rate
14 increase;
15 (2) the overall composite average rate increase requested;
16 (3) the increase requested by plan type;
17 (4) the date on which the proposed increase would take effect;
18 (5) the System for Electronic Rate and Form Filing (SERFF) tracking
19 number associated with the filing and a web address for accessing the filing
20 electronically; and
VT LEG #381824 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.137
2025 Page 29 of 34
1 (6) instructions for submitting public comments and the deadline for
2 doing so.
3 (b) Within five business days of after receiving a request for approval of
4 any composite average rate increase in excess of three 10 percent, or any other
5 coverage changes which that the Commissioner determines will have a
6 comparable impact on cost or availability of coverage for a Medicare
7 supplemental supplement insurance policy issued by any group or nongroup
8 health insurance company, hospital or medical service organization, or health
9 maintenance organization, with 5,000 or more total lives in the Vermont
10 Medicare supplement insurance market, the Commissioner shall notify the
11 Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent Living and the Office of
12 the Health Care Advocate of the proposed premium increase. A composite
13 average rate is the enrollment-weighted average rate increase of all plans
14 offered by a carrier.
15 (b)(c) Within five business days after receiving notification pursuant to
16 subsection (a)(b) of this section, the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and
17 Independent Living shall inform the members of the Advisory Board
18 established pursuant to 33 V.S.A. § 505 of the proposed premium increase.
19 (c)(d)(1) The Commissioner shall not approve any request to increase
20 Medicare supplemental supplement insurance premium rates unless the amount
21 of the rate increase complies with the statutory standards for approval under
VT LEG #381824 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.137
2025 Page 30 of 34
1 sections 4062, 4513, 4584, and 5104 of this title. Any approved rate increase
2 shall not be based on an unreasonable change in loss ratio from the previous
3 year, unless the Commissioner makes written findings that such change is
4 necessary to prevent a substantial adverse impact on the financial condition of
5 the insurer. In acting on such rate increase requests, the Commissioner may
6 deny the request, approve the rate increase as requested, or approve a rate
7 increase in an amount different from the increase requested. A decision by the
8 Commissioner other than an approval of the rate requested may be appealed by
9 the insurer, provided that the burden of proof shall be on the insurer to show
10 that the approved rate does not meet the statutory standards established under
11 this subsection.
12 (2) Before acting on the rate increase requested, the Commissioner may
13 make such examination or investigation as he or she the Commissioner deems
14 necessary, including where applicable the review process set forth in
15 subdivision (3) of this subsection.
16 (3) In reviewing any Medicare supplement rate increase for which an
17 independent analysis has been performed pursuant to 33 V.S.A. § 6706 and
18 wherein the carrier’s requested composite average increase, the independent
19 expert’s recommended composite average rate increase, or the Department
20 actuary’s recommended composite average rate increase differ by two
21 percentage points or more, the Commissioner shall hold a public hearing where
VT LEG #381824 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.137
2025 Page 31 of 34
1 the insurer, the Department’s actuary, the independent expert, any intervenor,
2 and the public will have the opportunity to present written and oral testimony
3 and will be available to answer questions of the Commissioner and those
4 present. The hearing shall be noticed and held at a time and place so as to
5 facilitate public participation, and shall be recorded and become part of the
6 record before the Commissioner. In the Commissioner’s discretion, the
7 hearing may be conducted through interactive. If the carrier’s requested
8 composite average increase, the independent expert’s recommended composite
9 average increase, or the Department actuary’s recommended composite
10 average increase differs by less than two percentage points, the Department
11 and the parties shall confer by conference call, or by any other available media,
12 to review the rate requests and recommendations. However, a public hearing
13 may be held at the Commissioner’s discretion for good cause shown.
14 (A) For any filing by a health insurance company, hospital or medical
15 service organization, or health maintenance organization with 5,000 or more
16 total lives in the Vermont Medicare supplement insurance market in which the
17 requested composite average rate increase exceeds 10 percent, the
18 Commissioner shall:
19 (i) solicit public comment; and
20 (ii) hold a public hearing in accordance with the Department of
21 Financial Regulation’s applicable rules regarding administrative procedures if,
VT LEG #381824 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.137
2025 Page 32 of 34
1 not later than 30 days after the rate filing information is posted on the
2 Department’s website pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, a hearing is
3 requested by the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent Living;
4 by the Office of the Health Care Advocate; or by not fewer than 25
5 policyholders whose premium rates would be affected by the requested rate
6 increase.
7 (B) For any filing that does not meet the criteria specified in
8 subdivision (A) of this subdivision (3), a public hearing may be held in the
9 Commissioner’s discretion.
10 (C) In the Commissioner’s discretion, a hearing held pursuant to this
11 subdivision (3) may be conducted through a designated electronic meeting
12 platform.
13 (4) In any review held in accordance with this subsection, the
14 Commissioner shall permit intervention by any person that the Commissioner
15 determines will materially advance the interests of the insured individuals.
16 The intervenor shall have access to, and may use the information of the
17 independent expert appointed under 33 V.S.A. § 6706. The reasonable and
18 necessary cost of intervention as determined by the Commissioner shall be
19 paid by the affected policyholders or certificate holders. The maximum
20 payment shall be $2,500.00 except when waived by the Commissioner for
21 good cause shown. The $2,500.00 maximum amount may be adjusted to
VT LEG #381824 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.137
2025 Page 33 of 34
1 reflect, at the Commissioner’s discretion, appropriate inflation factors. In any
2 review held in accordance with this section, the Commissioner shall permit
3 intervention by any person whom the Commissioner determines will materially
4 advance the interests of the individuals insured under the policy.
5 (5) Nonproprietary, relevant information in any Medicare supplement
6 rate filing, including any analysis by the Department’s actuary and the
7 independent expert, shall be made available to the public upon request.
8 (e) For a Medicare supplement insurance policy with an effective date of
9 January 1, the insurer shall file its premium rate request pursuant to this section
10 not later than July 1 of the preceding year. For a Medicare supplement
11 insurance policy with an effective date other than January 1, the insurer shall
12 file its rate request pursuant to this section not later than six months prior to the
13 effective date of the policy.
14 Sec. 21. REPEAL
15 33 V.S.A. § 6706 (Medicare supplement insurance; independent analysis) is
16 repealed.
17 Sec. 22. 8 V.S.A. § 2577(f) is amended to read:
18 (f) Moratorium. To protect the public safety and welfare and safeguard the
19 rights of consumers, virtual-currency kiosks shall not be permitted to operate
20 in Vermont prior to July 1, 2025 2026. This moratorium shall not apply to a

AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.137
2025 Page 34 of 34
1 virtual-currency kiosk that was operational in Vermont on or before June 30,
2 2024.
3 Sec. 23. EFFECTIVE DATES
4 This act shall take effect on July 1, 2025, except that Secs. 20 and 21

1 the Department of Financial Regulation, the Office of the Attorney General,
2 and other law enforcement personnel, if appropriate;
3 (5) whether a credit reporting agency should remove coerced debt from

14 On or before November 15, 2025, and for the purpose of preventing unfair
15 genetic discrimination and safeguarding an individual’s genetic privacy, the
16 Commissioner of Financial Regulation shall provide a recommendation to the

18 Committee on Finance on whether Vermont should enact a law prohibiting or
19 limiting an insurance company’s access to a consumer’s personalized genetic
20 report that is not part of the consumer’s medical record. Among other things,
21 the Commissioner shall consider whether to require that an insurance company

2025 Page 28 of 34
1 obtain consumer consent prior to the disclosure of genetic information
2 obtained from a direct-to-consumer entity to an insurance company, including
3 any company that offers health, long-term care, life, or disability insurance.
4 Sec. 20. 8 V.S.A. § 4062b is amended to read:

7 (a) Within five business days after receiving any request to increase the
8 premium rate for a Medicare supplement insurance policy from the health
9 insurance company, hospital or medical service organization, or health
10 maintenance organization issuing the policy, the Department shall post
11 information about the rate filing on the Department’s website, including:
12 (1) the name of the health insurance company, hospital or medical
13 service organization, or health maintenance organization requesting the rate
14 increase;
15 (2) the overall composite average rate increase requested;
16 (3) the increase requested by plan type;
17 (4) the date on which the proposed increase would take effect;

VT LEG #381824 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.137
2025 Page 29 of 34
1 (6) instructions for submitting public comments and the deadline for
2 doing so.
3 (b) Within five business days of after receiving a request for approval of
4 any composite average rate increase in excess of three 10 percent, or any other
5 coverage changes which that the Commissioner determines will have a
6 comparable impact on cost or availability of coverage for a Medicare
7 supplemental supplement insurance policy issued by any group or nongroup
8 health insurance company, hospital or medical service organization, or health
9 maintenance organization, with 5,000 or more total lives in the Vermont
10 Medicare supplement insurance market, the Commissioner shall notify the
11 Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent Living and the Office of
12 the Health Care Advocate of the proposed premium increase. A composite
13 average rate is the enrollment-weighted average rate increase of all plans
14 offered by a carrier.
15 (b)(c) Within five business days after receiving notification pursuant to
16 subsection (a)(b) of this section, the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and
17 Independent Living shall inform the members of the Advisory Board
18 established pursuant to 33 V.S.A. § 505 of the proposed premium increase.
19 (c)(d)(1) The Commissioner shall not approve any request to increase
20 Medicare supplemental supplement insurance premium rates unless the amount
21 of the rate increase complies with the statutory standards for approval under
VT LEG #381824 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.137
2025 Page 30 of 34
1 sections 4062, 4513, 4584, and 5104 of this title. Any approved rate increase
2 shall not be based on an unreasonable change in loss ratio from the previous
3 year, unless the Commissioner makes written findings that such change is
4 necessary to prevent a substantial adverse impact on the financial condition of
5 the insurer. In acting on such rate increase requests, the Commissioner may
6 deny the request, approve the rate increase as requested, or approve a rate
7 increase in an amount different from the increase requested. A decision by the
8 Commissioner other than an approval of the rate requested may be appealed by
9 the insurer, provided that the burden of proof shall be on the insurer to show
10 that the approved rate does not meet the statutory standards established under
11 this subsection.
12 (2) Before acting on the rate increase requested, the Commissioner may
13 make such examination or investigation as he or she the Commissioner deems
14 necessary, including where applicable the review process set forth in
15 subdivision (3) of this subsection.
16 (3) In reviewing any Medicare supplement rate increase for which an
17 independent analysis has been performed pursuant to 33 V.S.A. § 6706 and
18 wherein the carrier’s requested composite average increase, the independent
19 expert’s recommended composite average rate increase, or the Department
20 actuary’s recommended composite average rate increase differ by two
21 percentage points or more, the Commissioner shall hold a public hearing where
VT LEG #381824 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.137
2025 Page 31 of 34
1 the insurer, the Department’s actuary, the independent expert, any intervenor,
2 and the public will have the opportunity to present written and oral testimony
3 and will be available to answer questions of the Commissioner and those
4 present. The hearing shall be noticed and held at a time and place so as to
5 facilitate public participation, and shall be recorded and become part of the
6 record before the Commissioner. In the Commissioner’s discretion, the
7 hearing may be conducted through interactive. If the carrier’s requested
8 composite average increase, the independent expert’s recommended composite
9 average increase, or the Department actuary’s recommended composite
10 average increase differs by less than two percentage points, the Department
11 and the parties shall confer by conference call, or by any other available media,
12 to review the rate requests and recommendations. However, a public hearing
13 may be held at the Commissioner’s discretion for good cause shown.
14 (A) For any filing by a health insurance company, hospital or medical
15 service organization, or health maintenance organization with 5,000 or more
16 total lives in the Vermont Medicare supplement insurance market in which the
17 requested composite average rate increase exceeds 10 percent, the
18 Commissioner shall:
19 (i) solicit public comment; and
20 (ii) hold a public hearing in accordance with the Department of
21 Financial Regulation’s applicable rules regarding administrative procedures if,
VT LEG #381824 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.137
2025 Page 32 of 34
1 not later than 30 days after the rate filing information is posted on the
2 Department’s website pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, a hearing is
3 requested by the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent Living;
4 by the Office of the Health Care Advocate; or by not fewer than 25
5 policyholders whose premium rates would be affected by the requested rate
6 increase.
7 (B) For any filing that does not meet the criteria specified in
8 subdivision (A) of this subdivision (3), a public hearing may be held in the
9 Commissioner’s discretion.
10 (C) In the Commissioner’s discretion, a hearing held pursuant to this
11 subdivision (3) may be conducted through a designated electronic meeting
12 platform.
13 (4) In any review held in accordance with this subsection, the
14 Commissioner shall permit intervention by any person that the Commissioner
15 determines will materially advance the interests of the insured individuals.
16 The intervenor shall have access to, and may use the information of the
17 independent expert appointed under 33 V.S.A. § 6706. The reasonable and
18 necessary cost of intervention as determined by the Commissioner shall be
19 paid by the affected policyholders or certificate holders. The maximum
20 payment shall be $2,500.00 except when waived by the Commissioner for
21 good cause shown. The $2,500.00 maximum amount may be adjusted to

1 reflect, at the Commissioner’s discretion, appropriate inflation factors. In any
2 review held in accordance with this section, the Commissioner shall permit
3 intervention by any person whom the Commissioner determines will materially
4 advance the interests of the individuals insured under the policy.
5 (5) Nonproprietary, relevant information in any Medicare supplement
6 rate filing, including any analysis by the Department’s actuary and the
7 independent expert, shall be made available to the public upon request.
8 (e) For a Medicare supplement insurance policy with an effective date of
9 January 1, the insurer shall file its premium rate request pursuant to this section
10 not later than July 1 of the preceding year. For a Medicare supplement
11 insurance policy with an effective date other than January 1, the insurer shall
12 file its rate request pursuant to this section not later than six months prior to the
13 effective date of the policy.
14 Sec. 21. REPEAL
15 33 V.S.A. § 6706 (Medicare supplement insurance; independent analysis) is
16 repealed.
17 Sec. 22. 8 V.S.A. § 2577(f) is amended to read:
