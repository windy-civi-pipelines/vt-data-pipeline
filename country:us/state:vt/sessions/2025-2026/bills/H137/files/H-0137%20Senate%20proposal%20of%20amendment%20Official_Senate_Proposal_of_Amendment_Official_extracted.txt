(e) Licensee daily confirmation. If a licensee discloses that it will provide
a daily confirmation in the initial disclosure under subsection (c)(b) of this

Section 4:
section, the licensee may elect to provide a single, daily confirmation for all
transactions with or on behalf of a person on that day instead of a per-
transaction confirmation.
(f) Kiosk transaction receipt. Notwithstanding any other provision of law
to the contrary, a virtual-currency kiosk operator shall provide a customer with
both a paper and an electronic receipt in a retainable form for each virtual-
currency transaction completed at a virtual-currency kiosk. In addition to the

(1) Prior to entering into a virtual-currency transaction with a customer
at a virtual-currency kiosk, and as required by subdivision (c)(1)(D) of this

Section 6:
section, each virtual-currency kiosk operator shall ensure a warning is
disclosed to the customer substantially similar to the following:
Customer Notice. Please Read Carefully.
Did you receive a phone call from your bank, software provider, the police,
or were you directed to make a payment for Social Security, a utility bill, an
investment, warrants, or bail money at this kiosk? STOP
Is anyone on the phone pressuring you to make a payment of any kind?
STOP
I understand that the purchase and sale of cryptocurrency may be a final,
irreversible, and nonrefundable transaction.
I confirm I am sending funds to a digital wallet I own or directly have
control over. I confirm that I am using funds gained from my own initiative to
make my transaction.
(2) A virtual-currency kiosk operator shall ensure a customer has a
readily accessible opportunity to end a transaction for any reason prior to its
completion.
(h) Statement of material risks. As used in subdivision (c)(2)(F) of this

Section 7:
section, a statement of material risks associated with virtual-currency
transactions, generally, shall include disclosures substantially similar to the
following:
(1) Virtual currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the
government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation
protections.
(2) Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the State, federal, or
international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value
of virtual currency.
(3) Transactions in virtual currency may be irreversible and,
accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be
recoverable.
(4) Some virtual-currency transactions shall be deemed to be made
when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that
the customer initiates the transaction.
(5) The value of virtual currency may be derived from the continued
willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for virtual
currency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of
value of a particular virtual currency should the market for that virtual
currency disappear.
(6) There is no assurance that a person who accepts a virtual currency as
payment today will continue to do so in the future.
(7) The volatility and unpredictability of the price of virtual currency
relative to fiat currency may result in significant loss over a short period of
time.
(8) The nature of virtual currency may lead to an increased risk of fraud
or cyber attack.
(9) The nature of virtual currency means that any technological
difficulties experienced by the virtual-currency kiosk operator may prevent the
access or use of a customer’s virtual currency.
(10) Any bond or trust account maintained by the virtual-currency kiosk
operator for the benefit of its customers may not be sufficient to cover all
losses incurred by customers.
Sec. 24. 8 V.S.A. § 2577 is amended to read:

to a customer related to a single transaction or series of related transactions

currency kiosk operator of its current use of blockchain analytics.
(k) Full refund for new customers. The virtual-currency kiosk operator
shall provide a full refund to a customer who was fraudulently induced to
engage in a virtual-currency kiosk transaction, provided the fraudulently
induced transaction occurred while the customer was a new customer and
further provided the customer contacts the virtual-currency kiosk operator and

nature of the transaction within 90 days after the last fraudulently induced
transaction. The refund shall include all fees charged in association with the
fraudulently induced transaction.

monitoring customers on a post transaction basis.

Commissioner determines reasonably necessary for the protection of the
public.
(1) A disclosure required by this section must be made separately from
any other information provided by the licensee and in a clear and conspicuous
manner in a record the person may keep.
(2) The Commissioner may waive one or more requirements in
subsections (b)–(d) of this section and approve alternative disclosures
proposed by a licensee if the Commissioner determines that the alternative
disclosure is more appropriate for the virtual-currency business activity and
provides the same or equivalent information and protection to the public.
(b) Licensee disclosures prior to business activity. Before engaging in
virtual-currency business activity with a person, a licensee shall disclose, to the
extent applicable to the virtual-currency business activity the licensee will
undertake with the person:

by which fees and charges will be calculated if they are not set in advance and
disclosed, and the timing of the fees and charges, including general disclosure
regarding mark-ups and mark-downs on purchases, sales, or exchanges of
virtual currency in which the licensee or any affiliate thereof is acting in a
principal capacity;
(2) whether the product or service provided by the licensee is covered
by:
(A) a form of insurance or is otherwise guaranteed against loss by an
agency of the United States:

(i) up to the full U.S. dollar equivalent of virtual currency
purchased from the licensee or for control of virtual currency by the licensee
as of the date of the placement or purchase, including the maximum amount
provided by insurance under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
otherwise available from the Securities Investor Protection Corporation; or
(ii) if not provided at the full U.S. dollar equivalent of virtual
currency purchased from the licensee or for control of virtual currency by the
licensee, the maximum amount of coverage for each person expressed in the
U.S. dollar equivalent of the virtual currency; or
(B) private insurance against theft or loss, including cyber theft or
theft by other means;
(3) the irrevocability of a transfer or exchange and any exception to
irrevocability;
(4) a description of:
(A) liability for an unauthorized, mistaken, or accidental transfer or
exchange;
(B) the person’s responsibility to provide notice to the licensee of the
transfer or exchange;
(C) the basis for any recovery by the person from the licensee;
(D) general error-resolution rights applicable to the transfer or
exchange; and
(E) the method for the person to update the person’s contact
information with the licensee;
(5) that the date or time when the transfer or exchange is made and the
person’s account is debited may differ from the date or time when the person
initiates the instruction to make the transfer or exchange;
(6) whether the person has a right to stop a preauthorized payment or
revoke authorization for a transfer and the procedure to initiate a stop-payment
order or revoke authorization for a subsequent transfer;
(7) the person’s right to receive a receipt, trade ticket, or other evidence
of the transfer or exchange;
(8) the person’s right to at least 30 days’ prior notice of a change in the
licensee’s fee schedule, other terms and conditions of operating its virtual-
currency business activity with the person, and the policies applicable to the
person’s account; and
(9) that virtual currency is not money.
(c) Disclosures.

(1) Disclosures prior to each virtual-currency transaction. In connection
with any virtual-currency transaction effected through a money transmission
virtual-currency kiosk in this State, or in any transaction where the licensee or
any affiliate thereof is acting in a principal capacity in a sale of virtual
currency to, or purchase of virtual currency from, a customer, then
immediately prior to effecting such a purchase or sale transaction with or on
behalf of a customer, a licensee shall prominently disclose and shall require the
customer to acknowledge and confirm the terms and conditions of the virtual-
currency transaction, which shall include the following:
(1)(A) the type, value, date, precise time, and amount of the
transaction; and
(2)(B) the consideration charged for the transaction, including:
(A)(i) any charge, fee, commission, or other consideration for any
trade, exchange, conversion, or transfer involving virtual currency; and
(B)(ii) any difference between the price paid by the customer for
any virtual currency and the prevailing market price of such virtual currency, if
any;
(C) for a customer of a virtual-currency kiosk, a description of the
virtual-currency kiosk operator’s refund policy, which shall be consistent with
the requirements specified in subsections 2577(k) and (l) of this subchapter;
(D) for a customer of a virtual-currency kiosk, the customer warning
described in subdivision (g)(1) of this section; and
(E) the daily transaction limit, if applicable.
(2) Disclosures for new kiosk accounts. When opening an account for a
new customer, and prior to entering into an initial transaction for, on behalf of,
or with such customer, each virtual-currency kiosk operator shall disclose
relevant terms and conditions associated with its products, services, and
activities and with virtual currency, generally, including disclosures
substantially similar to the following:
(A) the customer’s liability for unauthorized virtual-currency
transactions;

(H) such other disclosures as are customarily given in connection
with the opening of customer accounts.
(d) Licensee receipt requirements. Except as otherwise provided in
subsection (e) of this section, at the conclusion of a virtual-currency
transaction with or on behalf of a person, a licensee shall provide the person
with a receipt that contains:
(1) the name and contact information of the licensee, including
information the person may need to ask a question or file a complaint;
(2) the type, value, date, precise time, and amount of the transaction
expressed in U.S. currency;
(3) the consideration charged for the transaction, including:
(A) any charge, fee, commission, or other consideration for any
trade, exchange, conversion, or transfer involving virtual currency; or
(B) the amount of any difference between the price paid by the
customer for any virtual currency and the prevailing market price of such
virtual currency, if any; and
(4) any other information required pursuant to section 2562 of this title.
(e) Licensee daily confirmation. If a licensee discloses that it will provide
a daily confirmation in the initial disclosure under subsection (c)(b) of this
section, the licensee may elect to provide a single, daily confirmation for all
transactions with or on behalf of a person on that day instead of a per-
transaction confirmation.
(f) Kiosk transaction receipt. Notwithstanding any other provision of law
to the contrary, a virtual-currency kiosk operator shall provide a customer with
both a paper and an electronic receipt in a retainable form for each virtual-
currency transaction completed at a virtual-currency kiosk. In addition to the
information required to be included in a receipt under subsection (d) of this
section or under section 2562 of this title, each receipt for virtual-currency
transaction completed at a virtual-currency kiosk shall include:
(1) the identification of any applicable digital wallet address to which
virtual currency is transmitted;

(2) the full name of the account owner;
(3) any unique transaction identifiers;
(4) a prominent statement of the virtual-currency kiosk operator’s
refund obligations under this section, in a form approved by the
Commissioner;
(5) a statement of the operator’s liability for nondelivery or delayed
delivery of virtual currency; and
(6) the name and telephone number of the Department of Financial
Regulation and a statement disclosing that a customer may contact the
Department with questions or complaints about an operator.
(g) Customer warning.
(1) Prior to entering into a virtual-currency transaction with a customer
at a virtual-currency kiosk, and as required by subdivision (c)(1)(D) of this
section, each virtual-currency kiosk operator shall ensure a warning is
disclosed to the customer substantially similar to the following:
Customer Notice. Please Read Carefully.
Did you receive a phone call from your bank, software provider, the police,
or were you directed to make a payment for Social Security, a utility bill, an
investment, warrants, or bail money at this kiosk? STOP
Is anyone on the phone pressuring you to make a payment of any kind?
STOP
I understand that the purchase and sale of cryptocurrency may be a final,
irreversible, and nonrefundable transaction.
I confirm I am sending funds to a digital wallet I own or directly have
control over. I confirm that I am using funds gained from my own initiative to
make my transaction.
(2) A virtual-currency kiosk operator shall ensure a customer has a
readily accessible opportunity to end a transaction for any reason prior to its
completion.
(h) Statement of material risks. As used in subdivision (c)(2)(F) of this
section, a statement of material risks associated with virtual-currency
transactions, generally, shall include disclosures substantially similar to the
following:
(1) Virtual currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the
government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation
protections.

(2) Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the State, federal, or
international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value
of virtual currency.
(3) Transactions in virtual currency may be irreversible and,
accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be
recoverable.
(4) Some virtual-currency transactions shall be deemed to be made
when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that
the customer initiates the transaction.
(5) The value of virtual currency may be derived from the continued
willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for virtual
currency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of
value of a particular virtual currency should the market for that virtual
currency disappear.
(6) There is no assurance that a person who accepts a virtual currency as
payment today will continue to do so in the future.
(7) The volatility and unpredictability of the price of virtual currency
relative to fiat currency may result in significant loss over a short period of
time.
(8) The nature of virtual currency may lead to an increased risk of fraud
or cyber attack.
(9) The nature of virtual currency means that any technological
difficulties experienced by the virtual-currency kiosk operator may prevent the
access or use of a customer’s virtual currency.
(10) Any bond or trust account maintained by the virtual-currency kiosk
operator for the benefit of its customers may not be sufficient to cover all
losses incurred by customers.
Sec. 24. 8 V.S.A. § 2577 is amended to read:
§ 2577. VIRTUAL-CURRENCY KIOSK OPERATORS
(a) Daily transaction limit.
(1) A virtual-currency kiosk operator shall not accept or dispense more
than $1,000.00 $2,000.00 of cash in a day in connection with virtual-currency
transactions with a single, new customer in this State via one or more money
transmission virtual-currency kiosks.
(2) A virtual-currency kiosk operator shall not accept or dispense more
than $5,000.00 of cash in a day in connection with virtual-currency
transactions with a single, existing customer in this State via one or more
virtual-currency kiosks.

(b) Fee cap. The aggregate fees and charges, directly or indirectly, charged
to a customer related to a single transaction or series of related transactions
involving virtual currency effected through a money transmission kiosk in this
State, including any difference between the price charged to a customer to buy,
sell, exchange, swap, or convert virtual currency and the prevailing market
value of such virtual currency at the time of such transaction, shall not exceed
the greater of the following:
(1) $5.00; or
(2) three 15 percent of the U.S. dollar equivalent of virtual currency
involved in the transaction or transactions.
(c) Single transaction. The purchase, sale, exchange, swap, or conversion
of virtual currency, or the subsequent transfer of virtual currency, in a series of
transactions shall be deemed to be a single transaction for purposes of
subsection (b) subsections (a) and (b) of this section.
(d) Licensing requirement. A virtual-currency kiosk operator shall comply
with the licensing requirements of this subchapter to the extent that the virtual-
currency kiosk operator engages in virtual-currency business activity.
(e) Operator accountability. If a virtual-currency kiosk operator allows or
facilitates another person to engage in virtual-currency business activity via a
money transmission virtual-currency kiosk in this State that is owned,
operated, or managed by the virtual-currency kiosk operator, the virtual-
currency kiosk operator shall do all of the following:
(1) ensure that the person engaging in virtual-currency business activity
is licensed under subchapter 2 of this chapter to engage in virtual-currency
business activity and complies with all other applicable provisions of this
chapter;
(2) ensure that any charges collected from a customer via the money
transmission virtual-currency kiosk comply with the limits provided by fee cap
established in subsection (b) of this section; and
(3) comply with all other applicable provisions of this chapter.
(f) Moratorium. To protect the public safety and welfare and safeguard the
rights of consumers, virtual-currency kiosks shall not be permitted to operate
in Vermont prior to July 1, 2025 2026. This moratorium shall not apply to a
virtual-currency kiosk that was duly licensed and operational in Vermont on or
before June 30, 2024.
(g) Report. On or before January 15, 2025, the Commissioner of Financial
Regulation shall report to the House Committee on Commerce and Economic
Development and the Senate Committee on Finance on whether the
requirements of this section coupled with relevant federal requirements are

sufficient to protect customers in Vermont from fraudulent activity. If deemed
necessary and appropriate by the Commissioner, the Commissioner may make
recommendations for additional statutory or regulatory safeguards. In
addition, the Commissioner shall make recommendations for enhanced
oversight and monitoring of virtual-currency kiosks for the purpose of
minimizing their use for illicit activities as described in the U.S. Government
Accountability Office report on virtual currencies, GAO-22-105462, dated
December 2021. Customer identification. For each virtual-currency
transaction occurring at a virtual-currency kiosk in this State, the virtual-
currency kiosk operator shall verify the identity of the customer prior to
accepting payment from the customer. A virtual-currency kiosk operator shall
not allow a customer to engage in any transaction at a virtual-currency kiosk
under any name, account, or identity other than the customer’s own true name
and identity. A virtual-currency kiosk operator shall obtain a copy of a
government-issued identification card that identifies the customer and shall
collect additional customer information, including the customer’s name, date
of birth, telephone number, address, and email address prior to accepting any
payment from a customer at a virtual-currency kiosk in this State. In addition,
a virtual-currency kiosk operator shall take a photograph of the customer in a
retainable format at the virtual-currency kiosk for each transaction. A virtual-
currency kiosk operator shall be strictly liable for any violation of this
subsection.
(h) Customer support. A virtual-currency kiosk operator shall offer live,
toll-free, telephone customer support during the hours of operation of a virtual-
currency kiosk. The customer support telephone number shall be displayed on
the virtual-currency kiosk or on the virtual-currency kiosk screen.
(i) Mandatory live screening.
(1) A virtual-currency kiosk operator shall identify and speak by
telephone with:
(A) a new customer over 60 years of age prior to such customer’s
first virtual-currency transaction with the virtual-currency kiosk operator; or
(B) a customer attempting to conduct more than $5,000.00 in virtual-
currency transactions during any consecutive 10-day period.
(2) The virtual-currency kiosk operator’s approval of a transaction
subject to a mandatory live screening under this subsection shall be dependent
upon its assessment of its communication with the customer during the
screening.
(3) A virtual-currency kiosk operator shall record and retain a copy of
each mandatory live screening.

(4) During the mandatory live screening, the virtual-currency kiosk
operator shall:
(A) positively identify the customer;
(B) reconfirm any attestations made by the customer at the virtual-
currency kiosk;
(C) discuss the purpose of the transaction; and
(D) discuss types of fraudulent schemes relating to virtual currency.
(j) Blockchain analytics. A virtual-currency kiosk operator shall use
blockchain analytics software and retain an established third party that
specializes in performing blockchain analytics to assist in the prevention of
sending purchased virtual currency from a virtual-currency kiosk operator to a
digital wallet known to be affiliated with fraudulent activity at the time of a
transaction. The Commissioner may request evidence from any virtual-
currency kiosk operator of its current use of blockchain analytics.
(k) Full refund for new customers. The virtual-currency kiosk operator
shall provide a full refund to a customer who was fraudulently induced to
engage in a virtual-currency kiosk transaction, provided the fraudulently
induced transaction occurred while the customer was a new customer and
further provided the customer contacts the virtual-currency kiosk operator and
a law enforcement or government agency to inform the operator and the
agency of the fraudulent nature of the transaction within 90 days after the
customer’s last virtual-currency transaction with the virtual-currency kiosk
operator. The refund shall include any fees charged in association with the
fraudulently induced transaction.
(l) Fee refund for existing customers. The virtual-currency kiosk operator
shall provide a fee refund to an existing customer who has been fraudulently
induced to engage in a virtual-currency kiosk transaction, provided the
customer contacts the virtual-currency kiosk operator and a law enforcement
or government agency to inform the operator and the agency of the fraudulent
nature of the transaction within 90 days after the last fraudulently induced
transaction. The refund shall include all fees charged in association with the
fraudulently induced transaction.
(m) Fraud prevention. A virtual-currency kiosk operator shall take
reasonable steps to detect and prevent fraud, including establishing and
maintaining a written antifraud policy. The antifraud policy shall, at a
minimum, include the following:
(1) the identification and assessment of fraud-related risk areas;
(2) procedures and controls to protect against identified risks;
(3) allocation of responsibility for monitoring risks;

§ 13301. CORPORATORS OF MUTUALFINANCIALINSTITUTIONS
(a) Persons named in the organizational documents constitute the original
board of corporators of a mutual financial institution. Membership on this
board continues until terminated by death, resignation, or disqualification as
provided in this section.
(b) All corporators shall be residents of the geographic area that the
financial institution serves or an area proximate to this geographic area. A
person may shall not continue as a corporator after ceasing to be a resident of
the financial institution’s geographic area or an area proximate to this
geographic area.
(c) Any corporator failing to attend the annual meeting of the board of
corporators for two successive years ceases to be a member of the board unless
reelected by a vote of the remaining corporators.
(d) The number of corporators may be fixed or altered by the internal
governance documents of the financial institution, and vacancies may be filled
by election at any annual meeting.
(e) More than 50 percent of all corporators shall be depositors of the
financial institution.
(f) At least two-thirds of all corporators shall be independent. As used in
this subsection, an “independent corporator” means an individual who is not an
employee, director, or officer of the financial institution, its subsidiaries, or its
affiliates.
(g) Corporators shall be fiduciaries of the depositor base and shall exercise
their authority in the best interests of the depositors with a duty of loyalty and
care. In exercising their duties as corporators, corporators shall consider the
interests of the depositors, the borrowers, and other customers of the financial
institution; the general benefit and economic well-being of the communities
served by the financial institution; and the safety, soundness, and general
business needs of the financial institution.
and by renumbering the remaining section to be numerically correct.
