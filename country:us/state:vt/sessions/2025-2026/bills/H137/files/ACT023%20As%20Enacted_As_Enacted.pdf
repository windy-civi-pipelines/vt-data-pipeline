Sec. 20. 8 V.S.A. § 4062b is amended to read:
§ 4062b. MEDICARE SUPPLEMENTAL HEALTH SUPPLEMENT
INSURANCE RATE REVIEW
(a) Within five business days after receiving any request to increase the
premium rate for a Medicare supplement insurance policy from the health
insurance company, hospital or medical service organization, or health
maintenance organization issuing the policy, the Department shall post
information about the rate filing on the Department’s website, including:
(1) the name of the health insurance company, hospital or medical
service organization, or health maintenance organization requesting the rate
increase;
(2) the overall composite average rate increase requested;
(3) the increase requested by plan type;
(4) the date on which the proposed increase would take effect;
(5) the System for Electronic Rate and Form Filing (SERFF) tracking
number associated with the filing and a web address for accessing the filing
electronically; and
VT LEG #383901 v.1

No. 23 Page 27 of 52
2025
(6) instructions for submitting public comments and the deadline for
doing so.
(b) Within five business days of after receiving a request for approval of
any composite average rate increase in excess of three 10 percent, or any other
coverage changes which that the Commissioner determines will have a
comparable impact on cost or availability of coverage for a Medicare
supplemental supplement insurance policy issued by any group or nongroup
health insurance company, hospital or medical service organization, or health
maintenance organization, with 5,000 or more total lives in the Vermont
Medicare supplement insurance market, the Commissioner shall notify the
Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent Living and the Office of
the Health Care Advocate of the proposed premium increase. A composite
average rate is the enrollment-weighted average rate increase of all plans
offered by a carrier.
(b)(c) Within five business days after receiving notification pursuant to
subsection (a)(b) of this section, the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and
Independent Living shall inform the members of the Advisory Board
established pursuant to 33 V.S.A. § 505 of the proposed premium increase.
(c)(d)(1) The Commissioner shall not approve any request to increase
Medicare supplemental supplement insurance premium rates unless the amount
of the rate increase complies with the statutory standards for approval under
sections 4062, 4513, 4584, and 5104 of this title. Any approved rate increase
VT LEG #383901 v.1

No. 23 Page 28 of 52
2025
shall not be based on an unreasonable change in loss ratio from the previous
year, unless the Commissioner makes written findings that such change is
necessary to prevent a substantial adverse impact on the financial condition of
the insurer. In acting on such rate increase requests, the Commissioner may
deny the request, approve the rate increase as requested, or approve a rate
increase in an amount different from the increase requested. A decision by the
Commissioner other than an approval of the rate requested may be appealed by
the insurer, provided that the burden of proof shall be on the insurer to show
that the approved rate does not meet the statutory standards established under
this subsection.
(2) Before acting on the rate increase requested, the Commissioner may
make such examination or investigation as he or she the Commissioner deems
necessary, including where applicable the review process set forth in
subdivision (3) of this subsection.
(3) In reviewing any Medicare supplement rate increase for which an
independent analysis has been performed pursuant to 33 V.S.A. § 6706 and
wherein the carrier’s requested composite average increase, the independent
expert’s recommended composite average rate increase, or the Department
actuary’s recommended composite average rate increase differ by two
percentage points or more, the Commissioner shall hold a public hearing where
the insurer, the Department’s actuary, the independent expert, any intervenor,
and the public will have the opportunity to present written and oral testimony
VT LEG #383901 v.1

No. 23 Page 29 of 52
2025
and will be available to answer questions of the Commissioner and those
present. The hearing shall be noticed and held at a time and place so as to
facilitate public participation, and shall be recorded and become part of the
record before the Commissioner. In the Commissioner’s discretion, the
hearing may be conducted through interactive. If the carrier’s requested
composite average increase, the independent expert’s recommended composite
average increase, or the Department actuary’s recommended composite
average increase differs by less than two percentage points, the Department
and the parties shall confer by conference call, or by any other available media,
to review the rate requests and recommendations. However, a public hearing
may be held at the Commissioner’s discretion for good cause shown.
(A) For any filing by a health insurance company, hospital or medical
service organization, or health maintenance organization with 5,000 or more
total lives in the Vermont Medicare supplement insurance market in which the
requested composite average rate increase exceeds 10 percent, the
Commissioner shall:
(i) solicit public comment; and
(ii) hold a public hearing in accordance with the Department of
Financial Regulation’s applicable rules regarding administrative procedures if,
not later than 30 days after the rate filing information is posted on the
Department’s website pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, a hearing is
requested by the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent Living;
VT LEG #383901 v.1

No. 23 Page 30 of 52
2025
by the Office of the Health Care Advocate; or by not fewer than 25
policyholders whose premium rates would be affected by the requested rate
increase.
(B) For any filing that does not meet the criteria specified in
subdivision (A) of this subdivision (3), a public hearing may be held in the
Commissioner’s discretion.
(C) In the Commissioner’s discretion, a hearing held pursuant to this
subdivision (3) may be conducted through a designated electronic meeting
platform.
(4) In any review held in accordance with this subsection, the
Commissioner shall permit intervention by any person that the Commissioner
determines will materially advance the interests of the insured individuals.
The intervenor shall have access to, and may use the information of the
independent expert appointed under 33 V.S.A. § 6706. The reasonable and
necessary cost of intervention as determined by the Commissioner shall be
paid by the affected policyholders or certificate holders. The maximum
payment shall be $2,500.00 except when waived by the Commissioner for
good cause shown. The $2,500.00 maximum amount may be adjusted to
reflect, at the Commissioner’s discretion, appropriate inflation factors. In any
review held in accordance with this section, the Commissioner shall permit
intervention by any person whom the Commissioner determines will materially
advance the interests of the individuals insured under the policy.
VT LEG #383901 v.1

No. 23 Page 31 of 52
2025
(5) Nonproprietary, relevant information in any Medicare supplement
rate filing, including any analysis by the Department’s actuary and the
independent expert, shall be made available to the public upon request.
(e) For a Medicare supplement insurance policy with an effective date of
January 1, the insurer shall file its premium rate request pursuant to this section
not later than July 1 of the preceding year. For a Medicare supplement
insurance policy with an effective date other than January 1, the insurer shall
file its rate request pursuant to this section not later than six months prior to the
effective date of the policy.
