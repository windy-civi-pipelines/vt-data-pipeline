8 person was operating, attempting to operate, or in actual physical control of a
9 vehicle in violation of section 1201 of this title.
10 (5) Fatal collision or incident resulting in serious bodily injury. The
11 evidentiary test shall also be required if the person is the surviving operator of
12 a motor vehicle involved in a fatal incident or collision or an incident or
13 collision resulting in serious bodily injury and the law enforcement officer has
14 reasonable grounds to believe that the person has any amount of alcohol or

14 The person also has the right to have additional tests made by someone of the
15 person’s own choosing at the person’s own expense. The person shall also be
16 informed of the location of one or more facilities available for drawing blood.
17 (5) A person who is requested by a law enforcement officer to submit to

1 (6) If the person refuses to take an evidentiary test, the refusal may be
2 offered into evidence against the person at trial, whether or not a search

1 evidentiary test. Pursuant to subdivision (d)(6) of this section, if a blood
2 sample is obtained by search warrant, the fact of the refusal may still be
3 introduced in evidence, in addition to the results of the evidentiary test. Once a
4 law enforcement official begins the application process for a search warrant,
