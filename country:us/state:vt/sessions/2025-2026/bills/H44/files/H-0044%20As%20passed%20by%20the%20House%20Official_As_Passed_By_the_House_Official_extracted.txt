7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to make
8 miscellaneous changes to the laws governing impaired driving. Specifically,
9 this bill proposes language that the Family Division of the Superior Court
10 reports adjudications of delinquencies and youthful offender violations related
11 to impaired driving to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. Further, this bill
12 proposes to align the impaired driving statutes so that a person whose blood
13 alcohol content is at the legal limit is considered a violation. Additionally, this
14 bill proposes language that a person’s refusal to comply with a warrant for a
15 blood sample could be prosecuted as a DUI refusal criminal charge. Finally,

15 be introduced in evidence, in addition to the results of the evidentiary test.
16 Once a law enforcement official begins the application process for a search
17 warrant, the law enforcement official is not obligated to discontinue the
18 process even if the person later agrees to provide an evidentiary sample. The
19 limitation created by Rule 41(g) of the Vermont Rules of Criminal Procedure
20 regarding blood specimens shall not apply to search warrants authorized by

this title; or

7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to make

11 to impaired driving to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. Further, this bill
12 proposes to align the impaired driving statutes so that a person whose blood
13 alcohol content is at the legal limit is considered a violation. Additionally, this
14 bill proposes language that a person’s refusal to comply with a warrant for a
15 blood sample could be prosecuted as a DUI refusal criminal charge. Finally,
16 this bill proposes to add definitions for certain terms used throughout the
17 statutes.

5 sample of breath for testing or if the law enforcement officer has reasonable
6 grounds to believe that the person is under the influence of a drug other than

21 when a law enforcement officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.44
2025 Page 8 of 45
1 person was operating, attempting to operate, or in actual physical control of a
2 vehicle in violation of section 1201 of this title.
3 (5) Fatal collision or incident resulting in serious bodily injury. The
4 evidentiary test shall also be required if the person is the surviving operator of
5 a motor vehicle involved in a fatal incident or collision or an incident or
6 collision resulting in serious bodily injury and the law enforcement officer has
7 reasonable grounds to believe that the person has any amount of alcohol or
8 other drug in his or her the person’s system.
9 * * *
10 (d) At the time a test is requested, the person shall be informed of the
11 following statutory information:
12 (1) Vermont law authorizes a law enforcement officer to request a test to
13 determine whether the person is under the influence of alcohol or other drug.
14 (2) If the officer’s request is reasonable and testing is refused, the
15 person’s license or privilege to operate will be suspended for at least six
16 months.
17 (3) If a test is taken and the results indicate that the person is under the
18 influence of alcohol or other drug, the person will be subject to criminal

3 deciding whether or not to submit to such a test or tests. The person must
4 decide whether or not to submit to the evidentiary test or tests within a
5 reasonable time and not later than 30 minutes from the time of the initial
6 attempt to contact the attorney, regardless of whether a consultation took place.
7 The person also has the right to have additional tests made by someone of the
8 person’s own choosing at the person’s own expense. The person shall also be
9 informed of the location of one or more facilities available for drawing blood.
10 (5) A person who is requested by a law enforcement officer to submit to
11 an evidentiary test administered with an infrared breath-testing instrument may
12 elect to have a second infrared test administered immediately after receiving
13 the results of the first test.
14 (6) If the person refuses to take an evidentiary test, the refusal may be
15 offered into evidence against the person at trial, whether or not a search
16 warrant is sought. The person may be charged with the crime of criminal
17 refusal if the person:
18 (A) has previously been convicted of a violation of section 1201 of
19 this title; or
20 (B) is involved in a crash or collision resulting in serious bodily
21 injury or death to another, in which case the court may issue a search warrant

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.44
2025 Page 10 of 45
1 and order the person to submit to a blood test, the results of which may be
2 offered into evidence against the person at trial; or
3 (C) refuses to comply with a search warrant that is obtained by a law
4 enforcement officer pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.
5 (e) In any proceeding under this subchapter, a law enforcement officer’s
6 testimony that he or she the officer is certified pursuant to section 20 V.S.A. §
7 2358 shall be prima facie evidence of that fact.
8 (f)(1) If a blood test is sought from a person pursuant to subdivision (a)(2)
9 of this section, or if a person who has been involved in a crash or collision
10 resulting in serious bodily injury or death to another refuses an evidentiary
11 test, a law enforcement officer may apply for a search warrant pursuant to
12 Rule 41 of the Vermont Rules of Criminal Procedure to obtain a sample of
13 blood for an evidentiary test. Pursuant to subdivision (d)(6) of this section, if
14 a blood sample is obtained by search warrant, the fact of the refusal may still
15 be introduced in evidence, in addition to the results of the evidentiary test.
16 Once a law enforcement official begins the application process for a search
17 warrant, the law enforcement official is not obligated to discontinue the
18 process even if the person later agrees to provide an evidentiary sample. The
19 limitation created by Rule 41(g) of the Vermont Rules of Criminal Procedure
20 regarding blood specimens shall not apply to search warrants authorized by
21 this section.

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.44
2025 Page 11 of 45
1 (2) If an evidentiary saliva test is sought from a person pursuant to
2 subdivision (a)(3) of this section, a law enforcement officer may apply for a
3 search warrant pursuant to Rule 41 of the Vermont Rules of Criminal
4 Procedure to obtain a sample of saliva for the evidentiary test. Pursuant to
5 subdivision (d)(6) of this section, if a saliva sample is obtained by search
6 warrant, the fact of the refusal may still be introduced in evidence, in addition
7 to the results of the evidentiary test.
8 (g) The Defender General shall provide statewide 24-hour coverage seven
9 days a week to ensure that adequate legal services are available to persons
10 entitled to consult an attorney under this section.
