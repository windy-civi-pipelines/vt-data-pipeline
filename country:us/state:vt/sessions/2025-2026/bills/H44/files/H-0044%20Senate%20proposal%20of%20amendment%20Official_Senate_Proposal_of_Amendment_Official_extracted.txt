deemed to have given consent to an evidentiary test of that person’s breath for
the purpose of determining the person’s alcohol concentration or the presence
of other drug in the blood. The test shall be administered at the direction of a
law enforcement officer.
(2) Blood test. If breath testing equipment is not reasonably available or
if the officer has reason to believe that the person is unable to give a sufficient
sample of breath for testing or if the law enforcement officer has reasonable
grounds to believe that the person is under the influence of a drug other than
alcohol, the person is deemed to have given consent to the taking of an
evidentiary sample of blood. If in the officer’s opinion the person is incapable
of decision or unconscious or dead, it is deemed that the person’s consent is
given and a sample of blood shall be taken. A blood test sought pursuant to
this subdivision shall be obtained pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.

test sought pursuant to this subdivision shall be obtained pursuant to
subsection (f) of this section. Any saliva test administered under this section
shall be used only for the limited purpose of detecting the presence of a drug
in the person’s body and shall not be used to extract DNA information.
(4) Evidentiary test. The evidentiary test shall be required of a person
when a law enforcement officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the
person was operating, attempting to operate, or in actual physical control of a
vehicle in violation of section 1201 of this title.
(5) Fatal collision or incident resulting in serious bodily injury. The
evidentiary test shall also be required if the person is the surviving operator of
a motor vehicle involved in a fatal incident or collision or an incident or
collision resulting in serious bodily injury and the law enforcement officer has
reasonable grounds to believe that the person has any amount of alcohol or
other drug in his or her the person’s system.
* * *
(d) At the time a test is requested, the person shall be informed of the
following statutory information:
(1) Vermont law authorizes a law enforcement officer to request a test to
determine whether the person is under the influence of alcohol or other drug.
(2) If the officer’s request is reasonable and testing is refused, the
person’s license or privilege to operate will be suspended for at least six
months.
(3) If a test is taken and the results indicate that the person is under the
influence of alcohol or other drug, the person will be subject to criminal
charges and the person’s license or privilege to operate will be suspended for
at least 90 days.
(4) A person who is requested by a law enforcement officer to submit to
an evidentiary test or tests has the limited right to consult an attorney before
deciding whether or not to submit to such a test or tests. The person must
decide whether or not to submit to the evidentiary test or tests within a
reasonable time and not later than 30 minutes from the time of the initial
attempt to contact the attorney, regardless of whether a consultation took place.
The person also has the right to have additional tests made by someone of the
person’s own choosing at the person’s own expense. The person shall also be
informed of the location of one or more facilities available for drawing blood.
(5) A person who is requested by a law enforcement officer to submit to
an evidentiary test administered with an infrared breath-testing instrument may
elect to have a second infrared test administered immediately after receiving
the results of the first test.
(6) If the person refuses to take an evidentiary test, the refusal may be
offered into evidence against the person at trial, whether or not a search
warrant is sought. The person may be charged with the crime of criminal
refusal if the person:
(A) has previously been convicted of a violation of section 1201 of
this title; or
(B) is involved in a crash or collision resulting in serious bodily
injury or death to another, in which case the court may issue a search warrant
and order the person to submit to a blood test, the results of which may be
offered into evidence against the person at trial; or
(C) knowingly hinders the collection of an evidentiary blood sample
when a warrant for that person’s blood is issued pursuant to subdivision (f)(1)
of this section.
(e) In any proceeding under this subchapter, a law enforcement officer’s
testimony that he or she the officer is certified pursuant to section 20 V.S.A.

Section 10:
§ 2358 shall be prima facie evidence of that fact.
(f)(1) If a blood test is sought from a person pursuant to subdivision (a)(2)
of this section, or if a person who has been involved in a crash or collision
resulting in serious bodily injury or death to another refuses an evidentiary
test, a law enforcement officer may apply for a search warrant pursuant to
Rule 41 of the Vermont Rules of Criminal Procedure to obtain a sample of
blood for an evidentiary test. Pursuant to subdivision (d)(6) of this section, if
a blood sample is obtained by search warrant, the fact of the refusal may still
be introduced in evidence, in addition to the results of the evidentiary test.
Once a law enforcement official begins the application process for a search
warrant, the law enforcement official is not obligated to discontinue the
process even if the person later agrees to provide an evidentiary sample. The
limitation created by Rule 41(g) of the Vermont Rules of Criminal Procedure
regarding blood specimens shall not apply to search warrants authorized by
this section.
(2) If an evidentiary saliva test is sought from a person pursuant to
subdivision (a)(3) of this section, a law enforcement officer may apply for a
search warrant pursuant to Rule 41 of the Vermont Rules of Criminal
Procedure to obtain a sample of saliva for the evidentiary test. Pursuant to
subdivision (d)(6) of this section, if a saliva sample is obtained by search
warrant, the fact of the refusal may still be introduced in evidence, in addition
to the results of the evidentiary test.
(g) The Defender General shall provide statewide 24-hour coverage seven
days a week to ensure that adequate legal services are available to persons
entitled to consult an attorney under this section.

Raw Text:
Senate proposal of amendment
H. 44
An act relating to miscellaneous amendments to the laws governing
impaired driving
The Senate proposes to the House to amend the bill by striking out all after
the enacting clause and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
Sec. 1. 4 V.S.A. § 33 is amended to read:
§ 33. JURISDICTION; FAMILY DIVISION
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the Family
Division shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and dispose of the following
proceedings filed or pending on or after October 1, 1990:
* * *
(8) All juvenile proceedings filed pursuant to 33 V.S.A. chapters 51, 52,
52A, and 53, including proceedings involving “youthful offenders” pursuant to
33 V.S.A. § 5281 whether the matter originated in the Criminal or Family
Division of the Superior Court, except for a proceeding charging the holder of
a commercial driver’s license or commercial learner’s permit as defined in 23
V.S.A. § 4103 with an offense or violation listed in 23 V.S.A. § 4116 that
would result in the license holder being disqualified from driving a
commercial motor vehicle if convicted or operating a commercial motor
vehicle with any offense or violation of any traffic control law other than
parking, vehicle weight, or vehicle defect violations.
* * *
(b) The Family Division of the Superior Court has jurisdiction to hear and
dispose of proceedings involving misdemeanor motor vehicle offenses filed or
pending on or after July 1, 2016, pursuant to 33 V.S.A. §§ 5201, 5203, and
5280, and 5281. The Family Division of the Superior Court shall forward a
record of any conviction or adjudication for violation of a law related to motor
vehicle traffic control, other than a parking violation, to the Commissioner of
Motor Vehicles pursuant to 23 V.S.A. § 1709. As used in this subsection,
“conviction” has the same meaning as in 23 V.S.A. § 4(60).
Sec. 2. 23 V.S.A. chapter 13, subchapter 13 is amended to read:
Subchapter 13. Drunken Driving
§ 1200. DEFINITIONS
As used in this subchapter:
* * *

(11) “Serious bodily injury” has the same meaning as in 13 V.S.A.
§ 1021(a)(2)(A).
§ 1201. OPERATING VEHICLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF
ALCOHOLOR OTHER SUBSTANCE; CRIMINALREFUSAL;
ENHANCED PENALTY FOR BAC OF 0.16 OR MORE
(a) A person shall not operate, attempt to operate, or be in actual physical
control of any vehicle on a highway:
(1) when the person’s alcohol concentration is:
(A) 0.08 or more; or
(B) 0.02 or more if the person is operating a school bus as defined in
subdivision 4(34) of this title; or
(C) 0.04 or more if the person is operating a commercial vehicle as
defined in subdivision 4103(4) of this title; or
(2) when the person is under the influence of alcohol; or
(3) when the person is under the influence of any other drug or under
the combined influence of alcohol and any other drug.
(b) A person who has previously been convicted of a violation of this
section shall not operate, attempt to operate, or be in actual physical control of
any vehicle on a highway and refuse a law enforcement officer’s reasonable
request under the circumstances for an evidentiary test where the officer had
reasonable grounds to believe the person was in violation of subsection (a) of
this section.
(c) A person shall not operate, attempt to operate, or be in actual physical
control of any vehicle on a highway and be involved in a crash or collision
resulting in serious bodily injury or death to another and refuse a law
enforcement officer’s reasonable request under the circumstances for an
evidentiary test where the officer has reasonable grounds to believe the person
has any amount of alcohol or drugs in his or her the person’s system.
(d)(1) A person who is convicted of a second or subsequent violation of
subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section when the person’s alcohol
concentration is proven to be 0.16 or more shall not, for three years from the
date of the conviction for which the person’s alcohol concentration is 0.16 or
more, operate, attempt to operate, or be in actual physical control of any
vehicle on a highway when the person’s alcohol concentration is 0.02 or more.
The prohibition imposed by this subsection shall be in addition to any other
penalties imposed by law.
(2) A person shall not operate, attempt to operate, or be in actual
physical control of any vehicle on a highway when the person’s alcohol

concentration is 0.02 or more if the person has previously been convicted of a
second or subsequent violation of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section
within the preceding three years and the person’s alcohol concentration for the
second or subsequent violation was proven to be 0.16 or greater. A violation
of this subsection shall be considered a third or subsequent violation of this
section and shall be subject to the penalties of subsection 1210(d) of this title.
(e) The fact that a person charged with a violation of this section is or has
been entitled to use a drug under the laws of this State shall not constitute a
defense against any charge of violating this section.
(f) A person may not be convicted of more than one violation of subsection
(a) or (j) of this section arising out of the same incident.
(g) For purposes of this section and section 1205 of this title, the defendant
may assert as an affirmative defense that the person was not operating,
attempting to operate, or in actual physical control of the vehicle because the
person:
(1) had no intention of placing the vehicle in motion; and
(2) had not placed the vehicle in motion while under the influence.
(h) As used in subdivision (a)(3) of this section, “under the influence of a
drug” means that a person’s ability to operate a motor vehicle safely is

construed to affect the meaning of the term “under the influence of alcohol.”
(i) Evidence of the results of a standardized field sobriety test conducted by
a law enforcement officer trained in Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving
Enforcement or a certified Drug Recognition Expert’s systematic evaluation of
observable signs and symptoms of a person charged with a violation of this
section shall be presumptively admissible at trial to demonstrate whether or
not the person was operating under the influence in violation of this section.
(j) A person suspected of violating this section shall submit to the
collection of an evidentiary blood sample when a warrant for that person’s
blood is issued pursuant to subdivision 1202(f)(1) of this title. This subsection
shall not be construed as impairing a person’s right to challenge the validity of
a search warrant in any subsequent legal proceedings.
* * *
§ 1202. CONSENT TO TAKING OF TESTS TO DETERMINE BLOOD
ALCOHOLCONTENT OR PRESENCE OF OTHER DRUG
(a)(1) Implied consent. Every person who operates, attempts to operate, or
is in actual physical control of any vehicle on a highway in this State is
deemed to have given consent to an evidentiary test of that person’s breath for
the purpose of determining the person’s alcohol concentration or the presence

of other drug in the blood. The test shall be administered at the direction of a
law enforcement officer.
(2) Blood test. If breath testing equipment is not reasonably available or
if the officer has reason to believe that the person is unable to give a sufficient
sample of breath for testing or if the law enforcement officer has reasonable
grounds to believe that the person is under the influence of a drug other than
alcohol, the person is deemed to have given consent to the taking of an
evidentiary sample of blood. If in the officer’s opinion the person is incapable
of decision or unconscious or dead, it is deemed that the person’s consent is
given and a sample of blood shall be taken. A blood test sought pursuant to
this subdivision shall be obtained pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.
(3) Saliva test. If the law enforcement officer has reasonable grounds to
believe that the person is under the influence of a drug other than alcohol, or
under the combined influence of alcohol and a drug, the person is deemed to
have given consent to providing of an evidentiary sample of saliva. A saliva
test sought pursuant to this subdivision shall be obtained pursuant to
subsection (f) of this section. Any saliva test administered under this section
shall be used only for the limited purpose of detecting the presence of a drug
in the person’s body and shall not be used to extract DNA information.
(4) Evidentiary test. The evidentiary test shall be required of a person
when a law enforcement officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the
person was operating, attempting to operate, or in actual physical control of a
vehicle in violation of section 1201 of this title.
(5) Fatal collision or incident resulting in serious bodily injury. The
evidentiary test shall also be required if the person is the surviving operator of
a motor vehicle involved in a fatal incident or collision or an incident or
collision resulting in serious bodily injury and the law enforcement officer has
reasonable grounds to believe that the person has any amount of alcohol or
other drug in his or her the person’s system.
* * *
(d) At the time a test is requested, the person shall be informed of the
following statutory information:
(1) Vermont law authorizes a law enforcement officer to request a test to
determine whether the person is under the influence of alcohol or other drug.
(2) If the officer’s request is reasonable and testing is refused, the
person’s license or privilege to operate will be suspended for at least six
months.
(3) If a test is taken and the results indicate that the person is under the
influence of alcohol or other drug, the person will be subject to criminal

charges and the person’s license or privilege to operate will be suspended for
at least 90 days.
(4) A person who is requested by a law enforcement officer to submit to
an evidentiary test or tests has the limited right to consult an attorney before
deciding whether or not to submit to such a test or tests. The person must
decide whether or not to submit to the evidentiary test or tests within a
reasonable time and not later than 30 minutes from the time of the initial
attempt to contact the attorney, regardless of whether a consultation took place.
The person also has the right to have additional tests made by someone of the
person’s own choosing at the person’s own expense. The person shall also be
informed of the location of one or more facilities available for drawing blood.
(5) A person who is requested by a law enforcement officer to submit to
an evidentiary test administered with an infrared breath-testing instrument may
elect to have a second infrared test administered immediately after receiving
the results of the first test.
(6) If the person refuses to take an evidentiary test, the refusal may be
offered into evidence against the person at trial, whether or not a search
warrant is sought. The person may be charged with the crime of criminal
refusal if the person:
(A) has previously been convicted of a violation of section 1201 of
this title; or
(B) is involved in a crash or collision resulting in serious bodily
injury or death to another, in which case the court may issue a search warrant
and order the person to submit to a blood test, the results of which may be
offered into evidence against the person at trial; or
(C) knowingly hinders the collection of an evidentiary blood sample
when a warrant for that person’s blood is issued pursuant to subdivision (f)(1)
of this section.
(e) In any proceeding under this subchapter, a law enforcement officer’s
testimony that he or she the officer is certified pursuant to section 20 V.S.A.
§ 2358 shall be prima facie evidence of that fact.
(f)(1) If a blood test is sought from a person pursuant to subdivision (a)(2)
of this section, or if a person who has been involved in a crash or collision
resulting in serious bodily injury or death to another refuses an evidentiary
test, a law enforcement officer may apply for a search warrant pursuant to
Rule 41 of the Vermont Rules of Criminal Procedure to obtain a sample of
blood for an evidentiary test. Pursuant to subdivision (d)(6) of this section, if
a blood sample is obtained by search warrant, the fact of the refusal may still
be introduced in evidence, in addition to the results of the evidentiary test.
Once a law enforcement official begins the application process for a search

warrant, the law enforcement official is not obligated to discontinue the
process even if the person later agrees to provide an evidentiary sample. The
limitation created by Rule 41(g) of the Vermont Rules of Criminal Procedure
regarding blood specimens shall not apply to search warrants authorized by
this section.
(2) If an evidentiary saliva test is sought from a person pursuant to
subdivision (a)(3) of this section, a law enforcement officer may apply for a
search warrant pursuant to Rule 41 of the Vermont Rules of Criminal
Procedure to obtain a sample of saliva for the evidentiary test. Pursuant to
subdivision (d)(6) of this section, if a saliva sample is obtained by search
warrant, the fact of the refusal may still be introduced in evidence, in addition
to the results of the evidentiary test.
(g) The Defender General shall provide statewide 24-hour coverage seven
days a week to ensure that adequate legal services are available to persons
entitled to consult an attorney under this section.
* * *
