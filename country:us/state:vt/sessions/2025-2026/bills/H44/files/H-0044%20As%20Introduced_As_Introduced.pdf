4 Referred to Committee on
5 Date:
6 Subject: Judiciary; motor vehicles; impaired driving; reporting
7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to make
8 miscellaneous changes to the laws governing impaired driving. Specifically,
9 this bill proposes language that the Family Division of the Superior Court
10 reports adjudications of delinquencies and youthful offender violations related
11 to impaired driving to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. Further, this bill
12 proposes to align the impaired driving statutes so that a person whose blood
13 alcohol content is at the legal limit is considered a violation. Additionally, this
14 bill proposes language that a person’s refusal to comply with a warrant for a
15 blood sample could be prosecuted as a DUI refusal criminal charge. Finally,
16 this bill proposes to add definitions for certain terms used throughout the
17 statutes.
18 An act relating to miscellaneous amendments to the laws governing

6 collision resulting in serious bodily injury and the law enforcement officer has
7 reasonable grounds to believe that the person has any amount of alcohol or
8 other drug in his or her the person’s system.
9 * * *
10 (d) At the time a test is requested, the person shall be informed of the
11 following statutory information:

11 an evidentiary test administered with an infrared breath-testing instrument may
12 elect to have a second infrared test administered immediately after receiving
13 the results of the first test.
14 (6) If the person refuses to take an evidentiary test, the refusal may be
15 offered into evidence against the person at trial, whether or not a search
16 warrant is sought. The person may be charged with the crime of criminal
17 refusal if the person:
18 (A) has previously been convicted of a violation of section 1201 of
19 this title; or

3 (C) refuses to comply with a search warrant that is obtained by a law
4 enforcement officer pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.
5 (e) In any proceeding under this subchapter, a law enforcement officer’s
6 testimony that he or she the officer is certified pursuant to section 20 V.S.A. §

9 of this section, or if a person who has been involved in a crash or collision
10 resulting in serious bodily injury or death to another refuses an evidentiary test,
11 a law enforcement officer may apply for a search warrant pursuant to Rule 41
12 of the Vermont Rules of Criminal Procedure to obtain a sample of blood for an
13 evidentiary test. Pursuant to subdivision (d)(6) of this section, if a blood
14 sample is obtained by search warrant, the fact of the refusal may still be
15 introduced in evidence, in addition to the results of the evidentiary test. Once a
16 law enforcement official begins the application process for a search warrant,
17 the law enforcement official is not obligated to discontinue the process even if
18 the person later agrees to provide an evidentiary sample. The limitation
19 created by Rule 41(g) of the Vermont Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding
20 blood specimens shall not apply to search warrants authorized by this section.

7 to the results of the evidentiary test.
