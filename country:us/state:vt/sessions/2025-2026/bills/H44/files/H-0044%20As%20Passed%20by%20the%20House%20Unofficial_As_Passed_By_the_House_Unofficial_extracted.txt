6 vehicle in violation of section 1201 of this title.
7 (5) Fatal collision or incident resulting in serious bodily injury. The
8 evidentiary test shall also be required if the person is the surviving operator of
9 a motor vehicle involved in a fatal incident or collision or an incident or
10 collision resulting in serious bodily injury and the law enforcement officer has
11 reasonable grounds to believe that the person has any amount of alcohol or
12 other drug in his or her the person’s system.
13 * * *
14 (d) At the time a test is requested, the person shall be informed of the
15 following statutory information:

12 person’s own choosing at the person’s own expense. The person shall also be
13 informed of the location of one or more facilities available for drawing blood.
14 (5) A person who is requested by a law enforcement officer to submit to
15 an evidentiary test administered with an infrared breath-testing instrument may
16 elect to have a second infrared test administered immediately after receiving
17 the results of the first test.
18 (6) If the person refuses to take an evidentiary test, the refusal may be
19 offered into evidence against the person at trial, whether or not a search
20 warrant is sought. The person may be charged with the crime of criminal
21 refusal if the person:
VT LEG #381121 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.44
2025 Page 9 of 23
1 (A) has previously been convicted of a violation of section 1201 of

6 offered into evidence against the person at trial; or
7 (C) refuses the collection of an evidentiary blood sample when a
8 warrant for that person’s blood is issued pursuant to subdivision (f)(1) of this

14 of this section, or if a person who has been involved in a crash or collision
15 resulting in serious bodily injury or death to another refuses an evidentiary test,
16 a law enforcement officer may apply for a search warrant pursuant to Rule 41
17 of the Vermont Rules of Criminal Procedure to obtain a sample of blood for an
18 evidentiary test. Pursuant to subdivision (d)(6) of this section, if a blood
19 sample is obtained by search warrant, the fact of the refusal may still be
20 introduced in evidence, in addition to the results of the evidentiary test. Once a
21 law enforcement official begins the application process for a search warrant,
VT LEG #381121 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.44
2025 Page 10 of 23
1 the law enforcement official is not obligated to discontinue the process even if
2 the person later agrees to provide an evidentiary sample. The limitation
3 created by Rule 41(g) of the Vermont Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding
4 blood specimens shall not apply to search warrants authorized by this section.
5 (2) If an evidentiary saliva test is sought from a person pursuant to
6 subdivision (a)(3) of this section, a law enforcement officer may apply for a
7 search warrant pursuant to Rule 41 of the Vermont Rules of Criminal
8 Procedure to obtain a sample of saliva for the evidentiary test. Pursuant to
9 subdivision (d)(6) of this section, if a saliva sample is obtained by search
10 warrant, the fact of the refusal may still be introduced in evidence, in addition
11 to the results of the evidentiary test.
12 (g) The Defender General shall provide statewide 24-hour coverage seven
13 days a week to ensure that adequate legal services are available to persons
14 entitled to consult an attorney under this section.

20 ALCOHOL CONTENT OR PRESENCE OF OTHER DRUG

3 to have given consent to an evidentiary test of that person’s breath for the
4 purpose of determining the person’s alcohol concentration or the presence of
5 other drug in the blood. The test shall be administered at the direction of a law

8 if the officer has reason to believe that the person is unable to give a sufficient
9 sample of breath for testing or if the law enforcement officer has reasonable
10 grounds to believe that the person is under the influence of a drug other than
11 alcohol, the person is deemed to have given consent to the taking of an
12 evidentiary sample of blood. If in the officer’s opinion the person is incapable
13 of decision or unconscious or dead, it is deemed that the person’s consent is
14 given and a sample of blood shall be taken. A blood test sought pursuant to
15 this subdivision shall be obtained pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.
16 (3) Saliva test. If the law enforcement officer has reasonable grounds to
17 believe that the person is under the influence of a drug other than alcohol, or

20 test sought pursuant to this subdivision shall be obtained pursuant to

1 shall be used only for the limited purpose of detecting the presence of a drug in
2 the person’s body and shall not be used to extract DNA information.
3 (4) Evidentiary test. The evidentiary test shall be required of a person
4 when a law enforcement officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the
5 person was operating, attempting to operate, or in actual physical control of a
6 vehicle in violation of section 1201 of this title.
7 (5) Fatal collision or incident resulting in serious bodily injury. The
8 evidentiary test shall also be required if the person is the surviving operator of
9 a motor vehicle involved in a fatal incident or collision or an incident or
10 collision resulting in serious bodily injury and the law enforcement officer has
11 reasonable grounds to believe that the person has any amount of alcohol or
12 other drug in his or her the person’s system.
13 * * *
14 (d) At the time a test is requested, the person shall be informed of the
15 following statutory information:

18 (2) If the officer’s request is reasonable and testing is refused, the
19 person’s license or privilege to operate will be suspended for at least six
20 months.
VT LEG #381121 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.44
2025 Page 8 of 23
1 (3) If a test is taken and the results indicate that the person is under the
2 influence of alcohol or other drug, the person will be subject to criminal
3 charges and the person’s license or privilege to operate will be suspended for at
4 least 90 days.
5 (4) A person who is requested by a law enforcement officer to submit to
6 an evidentiary test or tests has the limited right to consult an attorney before

8 decide whether or not to submit to the evidentiary test or tests within a
9 reasonable time and not later than 30 minutes from the time of the initial
10 attempt to contact the attorney, regardless of whether a consultation took place.
11 The person also has the right to have additional tests made by someone of the
12 person’s own choosing at the person’s own expense. The person shall also be
13 informed of the location of one or more facilities available for drawing blood.
14 (5) A person who is requested by a law enforcement officer to submit to
15 an evidentiary test administered with an infrared breath-testing instrument may
16 elect to have a second infrared test administered immediately after receiving
17 the results of the first test.
18 (6) If the person refuses to take an evidentiary test, the refusal may be
19 offered into evidence against the person at trial, whether or not a search
20 warrant is sought. The person may be charged with the crime of criminal
21 refusal if the person:
VT LEG #381121 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.44
2025 Page 9 of 23
1 (A) has previously been convicted of a violation of section 1201 of
2 this title; or

5 and order the person to submit to a blood test, the results of which may be
6 offered into evidence against the person at trial; or
7 (C) refuses the collection of an evidentiary blood sample when a
8 warrant for that person’s blood is issued pursuant to subdivision (f)(1) of this
9 section.
10 (e) In any proceeding under this subchapter, a law enforcement officer’s
11 testimony that he or she the officer is certified pursuant to section 20 V.S.A.
12 § 2358 shall be prima facie evidence of that fact.
13 (f)(1) If a blood test is sought from a person pursuant to subdivision (a)(2)
14 of this section, or if a person who has been involved in a crash or collision
15 resulting in serious bodily injury or death to another refuses an evidentiary test,
16 a law enforcement officer may apply for a search warrant pursuant to Rule 41
17 of the Vermont Rules of Criminal Procedure to obtain a sample of blood for an
18 evidentiary test. Pursuant to subdivision (d)(6) of this section, if a blood
19 sample is obtained by search warrant, the fact of the refusal may still be
20 introduced in evidence, in addition to the results of the evidentiary test. Once a
21 law enforcement official begins the application process for a search warrant,
VT LEG #381121 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.44
2025 Page 10 of 23
1 the law enforcement official is not obligated to discontinue the process even if
2 the person later agrees to provide an evidentiary sample. The limitation
3 created by Rule 41(g) of the Vermont Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding
4 blood specimens shall not apply to search warrants authorized by this section.
5 (2) If an evidentiary saliva test is sought from a person pursuant to
6 subdivision (a)(3) of this section, a law enforcement officer may apply for a
7 search warrant pursuant to Rule 41 of the Vermont Rules of Criminal
8 Procedure to obtain a sample of saliva for the evidentiary test. Pursuant to
9 subdivision (d)(6) of this section, if a saliva sample is obtained by search
10 warrant, the fact of the refusal may still be introduced in evidence, in addition
11 to the results of the evidentiary test.
12 (g) The Defender General shall provide statewide 24-hour coverage seven
13 days a week to ensure that adequate legal services are available to persons
14 entitled to consult an attorney under this section.
