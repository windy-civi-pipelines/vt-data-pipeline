is intended to provide a general summary of the act and may not be exhaustive. It has been prepared by the
staff of the Office of Legislative Counsel without input from members of the General Assembly. It is not
intended to aid in the interpretation of legislation or to serve as a source of legislative intent.
Act No. 41 (H.44). An act relating to miscellaneous amendments to the laws governing
impaired driving
Subjects: Motor vehicles; Judiciary; reporting; impaired driving
This act makes a variety of changes to the impaired driving laws, including technical
corrections, closing loopholes to ensure that the DMV is notified of license suspensions,
and creating proportionate accountability for noncompliance with warrant-based blood
draws, among other changes.
Sec. 1 of the act amends 4 V.S.A. § 33, concerning the jurisdiction of the Family
Division of the Superior Court. Specifically, this section makes technical corrections by
striking out the term “juvenile” and adding a reference to 33 V.S.A. chapter 52A—the
youthful offender chapter—to proceedings within the jurisdiction of the family court.
Additional changes to this statute are made to comply with federal “masking” regulations
for commercial drivers, ensuring that Vermont law does not permit a CDL holder who is
convicted of a qualifying traffic violation to have that violation be differed, dismissed, or
go unreported. Finally, this statute is further amended to make technical changes by
clarifying terms, ensuring that felony motor vehicle offenses can be heard in the Family
Division, and to ensure that Family Division court decisions are reported to the
Commissioner of Motor Vehicles.
Sec. 2 of the act amends various parts of 23 V.S.A. chapter 13, subchapter 13. First,
the term “serious bodily injury” is added to the definitions section of the subchapter.
Amendments to 23 V.S.A. § 1201 make gender neutral updates to the statute but also add
a new subsection (j) mandating a person’s compliance with the collection of an
evidentiary blood sample issued through a warrant. A person who knowingly hinders the
collection of an evidentiary blood sample could face a charge of criminal refusal.
However, subsection (f) ensures that a person cannot be convicted of both a DUI
violation and a criminal refusal. An amendment to 23 V.S.A. § 1202(d)(6) requires that a
DUI suspect is made aware that the suspect could be charged with a criminal refusal.
Sec. 2 also amends 23 V.S.A. § 1205 by resolving a statutory gap in the law between
23 V.S.A. §§ 1201 and 1205. 23 V.S.A. § 1201 creates a criminal offense if someone
possesses a BAC of .08 or higher. The act amends 23 V.S.A. § 1205 so that it is
consistent with 23 V.S.A. § 1201. Additionally, 23 V.S.A. § 1205(c) is amended to
ensure that the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles receives a police officer’s affidavit of
probable cause when someone is provided a DUI notice of violation. Finally, 23 V.S.A.

Section 2:
§ 1210 is amended to ensure that a separate DUI violation can be charged for each person
who dies or is seriously injured in the same DUI-related car crash, in addition to several
technical corrections to the statute.

Secs. 3 and 4 of the act amend 33 V.S.A. §§ 5202 and 5229 to ensure that the
Commissioner of Motor Vehicles receives any merits adjudication orders concerning the
potential license suspension of a person subject to a family court proceeding.
Sec. 5 of the act creates the Impaired Driving Processing Task Force. The Task Force
is created to study the concept of implied consent during DUI investigations with the dual
goals to recommend constitutional approaches that:
(1) minimize the length of a law enforcement encounter for a suspect; and
(2) minimize the processing and paperwork requirements for the law enforcement
officer.
The Task Force is composed of the Chief Judge of the Superior Court, the
Commissioners of Public Safety and Motor Vehicles, the Defender General, the
Executive Director of the Department of State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs, the President of
the Vermont Sheriff’s Association, and a representative from the Vermont Police
Association. A report in the form of proposed legislation is due to the House and Senate
Committees on Judiciary by November 15, 2025.
Sec. 6 states that the act goes into effect on July 1, 2025.
Effective Date: July 1, 2025
