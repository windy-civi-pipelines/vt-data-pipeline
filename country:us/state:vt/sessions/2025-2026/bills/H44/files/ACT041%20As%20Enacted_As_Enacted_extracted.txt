No. 41 Page 6 of 22
2025
other drug in the blood. The test shall be administered at the direction of a law
enforcement officer.
(2) Blood test. If breath testing equipment is not reasonably available or
if the officer has reason to believe that the person is unable to give a sufficient
sample of breath for testing or if the law enforcement officer has reasonable
grounds to believe that the person is under the influence of a drug other than
alcohol, the person is deemed to have given consent to the taking of an
evidentiary sample of blood. If in the officer’s opinion the person is incapable

given and a sample of blood shall be taken. A blood test sought pursuant to
this subdivision shall be obtained pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.
(3) Saliva test. If the law enforcement officer has reasonable grounds to
believe that the person is under the influence of a drug other than alcohol, or

when a law enforcement officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the
VT LEG #384126 v.1
No. 41 Page 7 of 22
2025
person was operating, attempting to operate, or in actual physical control of a
vehicle in violation of section 1201 of this title.
(5) Fatal collision or incident resulting in serious bodily injury. The
evidentiary test shall also be required if the person is the surviving operator of
a motor vehicle involved in a fatal incident or collision or an incident or
collision resulting in serious bodily injury and the law enforcement officer has
reasonable grounds to believe that the person has any amount of alcohol or
other drug in his or her the person’s system.
* * *
(d) At the time a test is requested, the person shall be informed of the
following statutory information:
(1) Vermont law authorizes a law enforcement officer to request a test to
determine whether the person is under the influence of alcohol or other drug.
(2) If the officer’s request is reasonable and testing is refused, the
person’s license or privilege to operate will be suspended for at least six
months.
(3) If a test is taken and the results indicate that the person is under the
influence of alcohol or other drug, the person will be subject to criminal
charges and the person’s license or privilege to operate will be suspended for at

person’s own choosing at the person’s own expense. The person shall also be
informed of the location of one or more facilities available for drawing blood.
(5) A person who is requested by a law enforcement officer to submit to
an evidentiary test administered with an infrared breath-testing instrument may
elect to have a second infrared test administered immediately after receiving
the results of the first test.
(6) If the person refuses to take an evidentiary test, the refusal may be
offered into evidence against the person at trial, whether or not a search
warrant is sought. The person may be charged with the crime of criminal
refusal if the person:
(A) has previously been convicted of a violation of section 1201 of
this title; or
(B) is involved in a crash or collision resulting in serious bodily
injury or death to another, in which case the court may issue a search warrant
and order the person to submit to a blood test, the results of which may be
offered into evidence against the person at trial; or
VT LEG #384126 v.1
No. 41 Page 9 of 22
2025
(C) knowingly hinders the collection of an evidentiary blood sample
when a warrant for that person’s blood is issued pursuant to subdivision (f)(1)
of this section.
(e) In any proceeding under this subchapter, a law enforcement officer’s
testimony that he or she the officer is certified pursuant to section 20 V.S.A.

Section 10:
§ 2358 shall be prima facie evidence of that fact.
(f)(1) If a blood test is sought from a person pursuant to subdivision (a)(2)
of this section, or if a person who has been involved in a crash or collision
resulting in serious bodily injury or death to another refuses an evidentiary test,
a law enforcement officer may apply for a search warrant pursuant to Rule 41
of the Vermont Rules of Criminal Procedure to obtain a sample of blood for an
evidentiary test. Pursuant to subdivision (d)(6) of this section, if a blood
sample is obtained by search warrant, the fact of the refusal may still be
introduced in evidence, in addition to the results of the evidentiary test. Once a
law enforcement official begins the application process for a search warrant,
the law enforcement official is not obligated to discontinue the process even if
the person later agrees to provide an evidentiary sample. The limitation
created by Rule 41(g) of the Vermont Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding
blood specimens shall not apply to search warrants authorized by this section.
(2) If an evidentiary saliva test is sought from a person pursuant to
subdivision (a)(3) of this section, a law enforcement officer may apply for a
search warrant pursuant to Rule 41 of the Vermont Rules of Criminal
VT LEG #384126 v.1
No. 41 Page 10 of 22
2025
Procedure to obtain a sample of saliva for the evidentiary test. Pursuant to
subdivision (d)(6) of this section, if a saliva sample is obtained by search
warrant, the fact of the refusal may still be introduced in evidence, in addition
to the results of the evidentiary test.
(g) The Defender General shall provide statewide 24-hour coverage seven
days a week to ensure that adequate legal services are available to persons
entitled to consult an attorney under this section.

No. 41 Page 6 of 22
2025
other drug in the blood. The test shall be administered at the direction of a law
enforcement officer.

VT LEG #384126 v.1

No. 41 Page 7 of 22
2025
person was operating, attempting to operate, or in actual physical control of a
vehicle in violation of section 1201 of this title.

evidentiary test shall also be required if the person is the surviving operator of
a motor vehicle involved in a fatal incident or collision or an incident or
collision resulting in serious bodily injury and the law enforcement officer has
reasonable grounds to believe that the person has any amount of alcohol or
other drug in his or her the person’s system.
* * *
(d) At the time a test is requested, the person shall be informed of the
following statutory information:
(1) Vermont law authorizes a law enforcement officer to request a test to
determine whether the person is under the influence of alcohol or other drug.
(2) If the officer’s request is reasonable and testing is refused, the
person’s license or privilege to operate will be suspended for at least six
months.

person’s own choosing at the person’s own expense. The person shall also be
informed of the location of one or more facilities available for drawing blood.

an evidentiary test administered with an infrared breath-testing instrument may
elect to have a second infrared test administered immediately after receiving
the results of the first test.
(6) If the person refuses to take an evidentiary test, the refusal may be
offered into evidence against the person at trial, whether or not a search
warrant is sought. The person may be charged with the crime of criminal
refusal if the person:
(A) has previously been convicted of a violation of section 1201 of
this title; or
(B) is involved in a crash or collision resulting in serious bodily
injury or death to another, in which case the court may issue a search warrant
and order the person to submit to a blood test, the results of which may be
offered into evidence against the person at trial; or
VT LEG #384126 v.1

No. 41 Page 9 of 22
2025
(C) knowingly hinders the collection of an evidentiary blood sample
when a warrant for that person’s blood is issued pursuant to subdivision (f)(1)
of this section.
(e) In any proceeding under this subchapter, a law enforcement officer’s
testimony that he or she the officer is certified pursuant to section 20 V.S.A.
§ 2358 shall be prima facie evidence of that fact.
(f)(1) If a blood test is sought from a person pursuant to subdivision (a)(2)
of this section, or if a person who has been involved in a crash or collision
resulting in serious bodily injury or death to another refuses an evidentiary test,
a law enforcement officer may apply for a search warrant pursuant to Rule 41
of the Vermont Rules of Criminal Procedure to obtain a sample of blood for an
evidentiary test. Pursuant to subdivision (d)(6) of this section, if a blood
sample is obtained by search warrant, the fact of the refusal may still be
introduced in evidence, in addition to the results of the evidentiary test. Once a
law enforcement official begins the application process for a search warrant,
the law enforcement official is not obligated to discontinue the process even if
the person later agrees to provide an evidentiary sample. The limitation
created by Rule 41(g) of the Vermont Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding
blood specimens shall not apply to search warrants authorized by this section.
(2) If an evidentiary saliva test is sought from a person pursuant to
subdivision (a)(3) of this section, a law enforcement officer may apply for a
search warrant pursuant to Rule 41 of the Vermont Rules of Criminal
VT LEG #384126 v.1

No. 41 Page 10 of 22

warrant, the fact of the refusal may still be introduced in evidence, in addition
to the results of the evidentiary test.

days a week to ensure that adequate legal services are available to persons
entitled to consult an attorney under this section.
