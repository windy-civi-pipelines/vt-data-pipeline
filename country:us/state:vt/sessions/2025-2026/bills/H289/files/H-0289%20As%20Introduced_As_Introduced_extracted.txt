1 (d) Alternative compliance payment. In lieu of purchasing renewable
2 energy or tradeable renewable energy or zero emissions credits or supporting
3 energy transformation projects to satisfy the requirements of this section and
4 section 8005 of this title, a retail electricity provider in this State may pay to
5 the Vermont Clean Energy Development Fund established under section 8015
6 of this title an alternative compliance payment at the applicable rate set forth in
7 section 8005. The administrator of the Vermont Clean Energy Development
8 Fund shall use the payment from a retail electricity provider electing to make
9 an alternative compliance payment to satisfy its obligations under subdivisions
10 8005(a)(1), 8005(a)(2), 8005(a)(4), and 8005(a)(5) of this title for the
11 development of renewable energy plants that are intended to serve and benefit
12 customers with low income of the retail electricity provider that has made the
13 payment. Such plants shall be located within the provider’s service territory, if
14 feasible. In the event that such a payment is insufficient to enable the
15 development of a renewable energy plant, the administrator may use the
16 payment for other initiatives allowed under section 8015 of this title that will
17 benefit customers with low income of the retail electricity provider that has
18 made the payment. As used in this subsection (d), “customer with low
19 income” means a person purchasing energy from a retail electricity provider

5 meet one or more categories within the RES CES.
6 Sec. 4. 30 V.S.A. § 8005 is amended to read:
7 § 8005. RES CES CATEGORIES
8 (a) Categories. This section specifies five categories of required resources
9 to meet the requirements of the RES CES established in section 8004 of this
10 title: total clean and renewable energy, distributed renewable generation,
11 energy transformation, new renewable energy, and load growth renewable
12 energy. In order to support progress toward Vermont’s climate goals and
13 requirements, a provider may, but shall not be required to, exceed the
14 statutorily required amounts under this section.
15 (1) Total clean and renewable energy.
16 (A) Purpose; establishment. To encourage the economic and
17 environmental benefits of renewable energy, this subdivision establishes, for
18 the RES CES, minimum total amounts of clean and renewable energy within
19 the supply portfolio of each retail electricity provider. To satisfy this
20 requirement, a provider may use clean energy generated within New England
21 or renewable energy with environmental attributes attached or any class of
VT LEG #380465 v.2
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.289
2025 Page 10 of 39
1 tradeable renewable energy credits generated by any renewable energy plant
2 whose energy is capable of delivery in New England.
3 (B) Required amounts.
4 (i) The amounts of total clean and renewable energy required by
5 this subsection (a) shall be 63 percent of each retail electricity provider’s
6 annual load during the year beginning on January 1, 2025, increasing by at
7 least an additional four 7.4 percent each third January 1 thereafter until
8 reaching 100 percent: on and after January 1, 2030.
9 (i) on and after January 1, 2035 for a retail electricity provider who
10 serves a single customer that takes service at 115 kilovolts and each municipal
11 retail electricity provider formed under local charter or chapter 79 of this title;
12 and
13 (ii) on and after January 1, 2030, for all other retail electricity
14 providers The amount of total renewable energy required by this subsection (a)
15 shall be 55 percent of each retail electricity provider’s annual electricity
16 purchases during the year beginning on January 1, 2027, increasing by an
17 additional four percent each January 1 hereafter, until reaching 75 percent on
18 and after January 1, 2032.
19 * * *
20 (2) Distributed renewable generation.
VT LEG #380465 v.2
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.289
2025 Page 11 of 39
1 (A) Purpose; establishment. This subdivision establishes a
2 distributed renewable generation category for the RES CES. This category
3 encourages the use of distributed generation to support the reliability of the
4 State’s electric system;, reduce line losses;, contribute to avoiding or deferring
5 improvements to that system necessitated by transmission or distribution
6 constraints;, and diversify the size and type of resources connected to that
7 system. This category requires the use of renewable energy for these purposes
8 to reduce environmental and health impacts from air emissions that would
9 result from using other forms of generation.
10 * * *
11 (E) Avoiding transmission and distribution constraints.
12 (i) Procurements by retail electricity providers and programs that
13 support meeting the requirements of this subdivision (2) shall avoid
14 development of new facilities in generation constrained areas of the
15 distribution or transmission system that would not need to be expanded but for
16 the addition of additional generation, unless costs associated with development
17 in those generation constrained areas are not passed through to ratepayers
18 through the cost to utilities to purchase the generation or in any other manner.
19 To implement the intent of this section, the Commission may update or adopt
20 rules, including rules that require a locational adjustor fee.
VT LEG #380465 v.2
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.289
2025 Page 12 of 39
1 (ii) A retail electricity provider may petition the Commission for
2 relief of the requirements of subdivision (C) of this subdivision (a)(2) or the
3 associated alternative compliance payment, which may be granted if the
4 provider can demonstrate that it is unable to meet its requirements without
5 extensive upgrades to the transmission or distribution infrastructure that would
6 be borne by the provider’s ratepayers. If relief is granted, the retail electricity
7 provider shall be required to instead acquire new renewable generation from
8 facilities that qualify to meet the requirements of subdivision (4) of this
9 subsection (a), in addition to the requirements as described in subdivision (4)
10 of this subsection (a).
11 (3) Energy transformation.
12 (A) Purpose; establishment. This subdivision (3) establishes an
13 energy transformation category for the RES CES. This category encourages
14 Vermont retail electricity providers to support additional distributed renewable
15 generation or to support other projects to reduce fossil fuel consumed by their
16 customers and the emission of greenhouse gases attributable to that
17 consumption. A retail electricity provider may satisfy the energy
18 transformation requirement through distributed renewable generation in
19 addition to the generation used to satisfy subdivision (2) of this subsection (a)
20 or energy transformation projects or a combination of such generation and
21 projects.

2 (4) New renewable energy.
3 (A) Purpose; establishment. This subdivision (4) establishes a new
4 regional renewable energy category for the RES CES. This category
5 encourages the use of new renewable generation to support the reliability of
6 the regional ISO-NE electric system. To satisfy this requirement, a provider
7 shall use new renewable energy with environmental attributes attached or any
8 class of tradeable renewable energy credits generated by any renewable energy
9 plant coming into service after January 1, 2010 whose energy is capable of
10 delivery in New England.
11 * * *
12 (6) Alternative compliance rates.
13 (A) The alternative compliance payment rates for the categories
14 established by subdivisions (1)–(3) of this subsection (a) shall be:
15 (i) total clean and renewable energy requirement — $0.01 per
16 kWh; and
17 (ii) distributed renewable generation and energy transformation
18 requirements — $0.06 per kWh.
19 (B) The Commission shall adjust these rates for inflation annually
20 commencing January 1, 2018, using the CPI.
VT LEG #380465 v.2
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.289
2025 Page 14 of 39
1 (C) For the distributed renewable energy, new renewable energy and

6 § 8006. TRADEABLE CREDITS; ENVIRONMENTAL ATTRIBUTES;
7 RECOGNITION, MONITORING, AND DISCLOSURE
8 (a) The Commission shall establish or adopt a amend and expand its system
9 of tradeable renewable energy credits for renewable resources that may be
10 earned by electric generation qualifying for the prior RES to include clean
11 energy generation. The system shall recognize tradeable renewable energy
12 credits monitored and traded on the New England Generation Information
13 System (GIS); shall provide a process for the recognition, approval, and
14 monitoring of environmental attributes attached to clean and renewable energy
15 that are eligible to satisfy the requirements of sections 8004 and 8005 of this
16 title but are not monitored and traded on the GIS; and shall otherwise be
17 consistent with regional practices.
18 (b) The Commission shall ensure that all electricity provider and provider-
19 affiliate disclosures and representations made with regard to a provider’s
20 portfolio are accurate and reasonably supported by objective data. Further, the
21 Commission shall ensure that providers disclose the types of generation used
VT LEG #380465 v.2
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.289
2025 Page 15 of 39
1 and shall clearly distinguish between energy or tradeable energy credits
2 provided from clean, renewable, and nonrenewable energy sources and
3 existing and new renewable energy.
4 Sec. 6. 30 V.S.A. § 8008 is amended to read:
5 § 8008. AGREEMENTS; ATTRIBUTE REVENUES; DISPOSITION BY
6 COMMISSION
7 (a) As used in this section, “the revenues” means revenues that are from the
8 sale, through tradeable clean or renewable energy certificates or other means,
9 of environmental attributes associated with the generation of clean and
10 renewable energy from a system of generation resources with a total plant
11 capacity greater than 200 MW and that are received by a Vermont retail
12 electricity provider on or after May 1, 2012, pursuant to an agreement,
13 contract, memorandum of understanding, or other transaction in which a
14 person or entity agrees to transfer such revenues or rights associated with such
15 attributes to the provider.

8 (a) Categories. This section specifies five categories of required resources
9 to meet the requirements of the RES CES established in section 8004 of this
10 title: total clean and renewable energy, distributed renewable generation,
11 energy transformation, new renewable energy, and load growth renewable
12 energy. In order to support progress toward Vermont’s climate goals and
13 requirements, a provider may, but shall not be required to, exceed the
14 statutorily required amounts under this section.
15 (1) Total clean and renewable energy.
16 (A) Purpose; establishment. To encourage the economic and
17 environmental benefits of renewable energy, this subdivision establishes, for
18 the RES CES, minimum total amounts of clean and renewable energy within
19 the supply portfolio of each retail electricity provider. To satisfy this
20 requirement, a provider may use clean energy generated within New England
21 or renewable energy with environmental attributes attached or any class of
VT LEG #380465 v.2

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.289
2025 Page 10 of 39
1 tradeable renewable energy credits generated by any renewable energy plant
2 whose energy is capable of delivery in New England.
3 (B) Required amounts.
4 (i) The amounts of total clean and renewable energy required by
5 this subsection (a) shall be 63 percent of each retail electricity provider’s
6 annual load during the year beginning on January 1, 2025, increasing by at
7 least an additional four 7.4 percent each third January 1 thereafter until
8 reaching 100 percent: on and after January 1, 2030.
9 (i) on and after January 1, 2035 for a retail electricity provider who
10 serves a single customer that takes service at 115 kilovolts and each municipal
11 retail electricity provider formed under local charter or chapter 79 of this title;
12 and
13 (ii) on and after January 1, 2030, for all other retail electricity
14 providers The amount of total renewable energy required by this subsection (a)
15 shall be 55 percent of each retail electricity provider’s annual electricity
16 purchases during the year beginning on January 1, 2027, increasing by an
17 additional four percent each January 1 hereafter, until reaching 75 percent on
18 and after January 1, 2032.
19 * * *
20 (2) Distributed renewable generation.
VT LEG #380465 v.2

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.289
2025 Page 11 of 39
1 (A) Purpose; establishment. This subdivision establishes a
2 distributed renewable generation category for the RES CES. This category
3 encourages the use of distributed generation to support the reliability of the
4 State’s electric system;, reduce line losses;, contribute to avoiding or deferring
5 improvements to that system necessitated by transmission or distribution
6 constraints;, and diversify the size and type of resources connected to that
7 system. This category requires the use of renewable energy for these purposes
8 to reduce environmental and health impacts from air emissions that would
9 result from using other forms of generation.
10 * * *
11 (E) Avoiding transmission and distribution constraints.
12 (i) Procurements by retail electricity providers and programs that
13 support meeting the requirements of this subdivision (2) shall avoid
14 development of new facilities in generation constrained areas of the
15 distribution or transmission system that would not need to be expanded but for
16 the addition of additional generation, unless costs associated with development
17 in those generation constrained areas are not passed through to ratepayers
18 through the cost to utilities to purchase the generation or in any other manner.
19 To implement the intent of this section, the Commission may update or adopt
20 rules, including rules that require a locational adjustor fee.
VT LEG #380465 v.2

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.289
2025 Page 12 of 39
1 (ii) A retail electricity provider may petition the Commission for
2 relief of the requirements of subdivision (C) of this subdivision (a)(2) or the
3 associated alternative compliance payment, which may be granted if the
4 provider can demonstrate that it is unable to meet its requirements without
5 extensive upgrades to the transmission or distribution infrastructure that would
6 be borne by the provider’s ratepayers. If relief is granted, the retail electricity
7 provider shall be required to instead acquire new renewable generation from
8 facilities that qualify to meet the requirements of subdivision (4) of this
9 subsection (a), in addition to the requirements as described in subdivision (4)
10 of this subsection (a).
11 (3) Energy transformation.
12 (A) Purpose; establishment. This subdivision (3) establishes an
13 energy transformation category for the RES CES. This category encourages
14 Vermont retail electricity providers to support additional distributed renewable
15 generation or to support other projects to reduce fossil fuel consumed by their
16 customers and the emission of greenhouse gases attributable to that
17 consumption. A retail electricity provider may satisfy the energy
18 transformation requirement through distributed renewable generation in
19 addition to the generation used to satisfy subdivision (2) of this subsection (a)
20 or energy transformation projects or a combination of such generation and
21 projects.

3 (A) Purpose; establishment. This subdivision (4) establishes a new
4 regional renewable energy category for the RES CES. This category
5 encourages the use of new renewable generation to support the reliability of
6 the regional ISO-NE electric system. To satisfy this requirement, a provider
7 shall use new renewable energy with environmental attributes attached or any
8 class of tradeable renewable energy credits generated by any renewable energy
9 plant coming into service after January 1, 2010 whose energy is capable of
10 delivery in New England.
11 * * *
12 (6) Alternative compliance rates.
13 (A) The alternative compliance payment rates for the categories
14 established by subdivisions (1)–(3) of this subsection (a) shall be:
15 (i) total clean and renewable energy requirement — $0.01 per
16 kWh; and
17 (ii) distributed renewable generation and energy transformation
18 requirements — $0.06 per kWh.
19 (B) The Commission shall adjust these rates for inflation annually
20 commencing January 1, 2018, using the CPI.
VT LEG #380465 v.2

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.289
2025 Page 14 of 39
1 (C) For the distributed renewable energy, new renewable energy and
2 load growth requirements, it shall be $0.04 per kWh annually commencing on
3 January 1, 2025, with calculations for inflation beginning on January 1, 2023.

6 § 8006. TRADEABLE CREDITS; ENVIRONMENTAL ATTRIBUTES;
7 RECOGNITION, MONITORING, AND DISCLOSURE
8 (a) The Commission shall establish or adopt a amend and expand its system
9 of tradeable renewable energy credits for renewable resources that may be
10 earned by electric generation qualifying for the prior RES to include clean
11 energy generation. The system shall recognize tradeable renewable energy
12 credits monitored and traded on the New England Generation Information
13 System (GIS); shall provide a process for the recognition, approval, and
14 monitoring of environmental attributes attached to clean and renewable energy
15 that are eligible to satisfy the requirements of sections 8004 and 8005 of this
16 title but are not monitored and traded on the GIS; and shall otherwise be
17 consistent with regional practices.
18 (b) The Commission shall ensure that all electricity provider and provider-
19 affiliate disclosures and representations made with regard to a provider’s
20 portfolio are accurate and reasonably supported by objective data. Further, the
21 Commission shall ensure that providers disclose the types of generation used
VT LEG #380465 v.2

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.289
2025 Page 15 of 39
1 and shall clearly distinguish between energy or tradeable energy credits
2 provided from clean, renewable, and nonrenewable energy sources and
3 existing and new renewable energy.
4 Sec. 6. 30 V.S.A. § 8008 is amended to read:
5 § 8008. AGREEMENTS; ATTRIBUTE REVENUES; DISPOSITION BY
6 COMMISSION
7 (a) As used in this section, “the revenues” means revenues that are from the
8 sale, through tradeable clean or renewable energy certificates or other means,
9 of environmental attributes associated with the generation of clean and
10 renewable energy from a system of generation resources with a total plant
11 capacity greater than 200 MW and that are received by a Vermont retail
12 electricity provider on or after May 1, 2012, pursuant to an agreement,
13 contract, memorandum of understanding, or other transaction in which a
14 person or entity agrees to transfer such revenues or rights associated with such
15 attributes to the provider.
