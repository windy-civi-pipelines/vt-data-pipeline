§ 2632. TERMINATION
BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE AND SENATE H.98
2025 Page 27 of 28
(a) A parent may file a motion to terminate a guardianship at any time.
The motion shall be filed with the Probate Division that issued the
guardianship order and served on all parties and interested persons.
(b)(1) If the motion to terminate is made with respect to a consensual
guardianship established under section 2626 of this title or a standby
guardianship established under section 2626a of this title, the court shall grant
the motion and terminate the guardianship unless the guardian files a motion
to continue the guardianship within 30 days after the motion to terminate is

continue the guardianship unless the guardian establishes by clear and
convincing evidence that the minor is a child in need of guardianship under
subdivision 2622(2)(B) of this title. In the case of a standby guardianship
established under section 2626 of this title, the custodial parent shall be
permitted to appear at and participate in the hearing remotely.

(c)(1) If the motion to terminate the guardianship is made with respect to a
nonconsensual guardianship established under section 2627 or subdivision
2632(b)(3) of this title, the court shall dismiss the motion unless the parent
establishes that a change in circumstances has occurred since the previous
guardianship order was issued.
(2) If the court finds that a change in circumstances has occurred since
the previous guardianship order was issued, the court shall grant the motion to
terminate the guardianship unless the guardian establishes by clear and
convincing evidence that the minor is a child in need of guardianship under
subdivision 2622(2)(B) of this title.
Sec. 9. EFFECTIVE DATES
