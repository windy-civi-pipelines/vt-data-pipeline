4 Sec. 1. 10 V.S.A. § 567 is amended to read:
5 § 567. MOTOR VEHICLE POLLUTION

14 vehicles concerned and shall not require, as a condition precedent to the initial
15 sale of a vehicle or vehicular equipment, the inspection, certification, or other
16 approval of any feature or equipment designed for the control of emissions
17 from motor vehicles, if the feature or equipment has been certified, approved,
