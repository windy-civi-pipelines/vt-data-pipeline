Whereas, the Town of Bennington annually celebrates the August 16, 1777 American
War for Independence victory of patriot forces, including members of the Green
Mountain Rangers (many of whom were Green Mountain Boys), at the Battle of
Bennington in which the Americans defeated a large contingent of British and other
loyalist forces under the command of British General John Burgoyne, who had
unsuccessfully sought to capture a Bennington supply depot, and
Whereas, this observance consists of festive events centered on a much-anticipated
parade featuring floats, musicians, marchers representing local organizations, public
safety vehicles, and Vermont dignitaries, and
Whereas, originally, this venerable marching extravaganza and the associated
activities were the responsibility of an ad hoc committee of local business owners and
citizens, some of whom, including John Proud, were Bennington Fire Department
members, and
Whereas, seeking a long-term management structure for the Bennington Battle Day
Weekend commemorations, the ad hoc committee approached the Bennington Fire Chief,
Chuck Sawyer, to inquire if the department would assume this role, and
Whereas, at the Bennington Fire Department’s January 1965 meeting, the question
was presented and the idea endorsed, with the 1965 celebration becoming the first under
the department’s purview, and
Whereas, the department’s first Bennington Battle Day Weekend Committee consisted
of Chief Sawyer (General Chairperson); Ornal Pierce Sr. (Treasurer); assistant chiefs
Joseph Wasick, Edwin Mattison, and Mike Walker; and other department members
serving on the committee, and
Whereas, to finance these events, the department hosts a series of fundraisers
throughout the year, and among the other Bennington Battle Day Weekend celebrations
are a car show, sporting competitions, a chicken barbeque dinner, and a Las Vegas
night, and
Whereas, for 60 years, the Bennington Fire Department has served as the ideal
guardian angel for this local summertime tradition, now therefore be it
