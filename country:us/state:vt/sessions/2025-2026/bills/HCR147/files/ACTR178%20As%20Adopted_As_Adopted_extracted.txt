Whereas, in 1884, the General Assembly adopted Act 180 incorporating “The Trustees

waters, and
Whereas, after deliberations, on October 13, 1775, considered the U.S. Navy’s
founding date, the Continental Congress created a naval advisory committee of which
future president John Adams was a member, and
Whereas, accepting the Committee’s recommendations that defensive and offensive
naval capabilities be developed, the Continental Congress directed that Massachusetts
supply George Washington, then stationed in that colony, with an armed schooner and a
sloop for the purpose of seizing British supply vessels, and

ships and created an organizational structure formalizing the Continental Navy, and
Whereas, after serving a vital role in the American War of Independence, the U.S.
Navy was shuttered, but new maritime dangers such as the Barbary pirates emerged,
prompting the U.S. Congress on January 2, 1794 to resolve to create “a naval force,
adequate to the protection of the United States against the Algerine corsairs,” and on
March 27, 1794, Congress adopted an “Act to provide a Naval Armament,” officially
forming today’s U.S. Navy, and
