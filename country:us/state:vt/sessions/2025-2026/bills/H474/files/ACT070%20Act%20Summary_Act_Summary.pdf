Act No. 70 (H.474). An act relating to miscellaneous changes to election law
Subjects: Campaign finance; elections; nominations; ranked-choice voting; write-in
candidates; electronic ballot return; recounts
This act prohibits candidates who lose a major party primary election from running in
the general election under another party or as an independent candidate. It requires write-
in candidates to file with either the Secretary of State or relevant clerks before an election
in order to have their votes counted. This act modifies monetary thresholds for when
candidates, parties, and committees must register and file campaign finance information
with the Secretary of State. It redefines the term “independent expenditure-only
committee” and inserts this term alongside the term “political committees” so that the
two entities comply with the same laws (excluding contributions). This act requires town
clerks and boards of civil authority to perform audits of voter checklists for
Representative districts and Senatorial districts that split municipal boundaries. It
clarifies the prohibition on casting more than one ballot. This act modifies various State
and local election deadlines and procedures. It expressly exempts annual meetings from
the Vermont Open Meeting Law. This act also modifies automatic voter registration at
the Department of Motor Vehicles so that an applicant for a driver’s license is
automatically registered to vote if the applicant attests to having U.S. citizenship or if the
Department has proof of U.S. citizenship for the applicant, unless the applicant opts out.
