11 otherwise it transmits information in such manner or of such substance that a
12 prospective applicant for health insurance may be misled by it to the
13 applicant’s material damage.
14 (b)(1) If the Commissioner finds that any such advertising copy or
15 advertising practice or plan of solicitation is materially misleading or
16 deceptive, the Commissioner shall order the company or the agent or broker
17 using such copy or practice or plan to cease and desist from such use.

3 § 4017. EXEMPTION FROM ATTACHMENT AND TRUSTEE PROCESS
4 So much of any benefits under all policies of health insurance as does not
5 exceed $200.00 for each month during any period of disability covered by the

7 be seized, taken, appropriated, or applied by any legal or equitable process or
8 by operation of law, either before or after payment of such benefits, to pay any
9 debt or liabilities of the person insured under the policy. However, this
10 exemption shall not apply where an action is brought to recover for necessaries
11 contracted for during the period of disability and the writ or bill of complaint
12 contains a statement to that effect. When a policy provides for a lump sum
13 payment because of a dismemberment or other loss insured, the payment shall
14 be exempt from execution of the covered individual’s creditors.
15 § 4018. THIRD-PARTY OWNERSHIP
16 Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as preventing a person other than
17 the covered individual with proper insurable interest from making application
18 for and owning a policy covering the covered individual or from being entitled
19 under such a policy to any indemnities, benefits, and rights provided in the
20 policy.

5 forms for filing proof of loss under the plan, or investigating any claim of loss
6 under the plan.
7 § 4020. AGE LIMITS
8 (a) If a health insurance plan contains a provision establishing, as an age
9 limit or otherwise, a date after which the coverage provided by the plan will
10 not be effective, and if that date falls within a period for which the health
11 insurer has accepted a premium or if the health insurer accepts a premium after
12 that date, the coverage provided by the plan shall continue in force subject to
13 any right of cancellation until the end of the period for which a premium has
14 been accepted.
15 (b) Notwithstanding any provision of subsection (a) of this section to the
16 contrary, if the age of the covered individual has been misstated and if,
17 according to the correct age of the covered individual, the coverage provided
18 by the policy would not have become effective or would have ceased prior to
19 the health insurer’s acceptance of the premium or premiums, then the health
20 insurer’s liability shall be limited to the refund, upon request, of all premiums
21 paid for the period not covered by the plan.

1 (e) Within the time period set forth in subdivision (a)(2)(A) of this section,
2 the Board shall:
3 (1) conduct a public hearing, at which the Board shall:
4 (A) call as witnesses the Commissioner of Financial Regulation or
5 designee and the Board’s contracting actuary, if any, unless all parties agree to
6 waive such testimony; and
7 (B) provide an opportunity for testimony from the insurer, the Office
8 of the Health Care Advocate, and members of the public;
9 (2) at a public hearing, announce the Board’s decision of whether to
10 approve, modify, or disapprove the proposed rate; and
11 (3) issue its decision in writing.
12 (f)(1) The insurer shall notify its policyholders of the Board’s decision in a
13 timely manner, as defined by the Board by rule.
14 (2) Rates shall take effect on the date specified in the insurer’s rate
15 filing.
16 (3) If the Board has not issued its decision by the effective date specified
17 in the insurer’s rate filing, the insurer shall notify its policyholders of its
18 pending rate request and of the effective date proposed by the insurer in its rate
19 filing.
20 (g) A health insurer, the Office of the Health Care Advocate, and any
21 member of the public with party status, as defined by the Board by rule, may

1 appeal a decision of the Board approving, modifying, or disapproving the
2 insurer’s proposed rate to the Vermont Supreme Court.
3 (h)(1) The authority of the Board under this section shall apply only to the
4 rate review process for policies for major medical insurance coverage and shall
5 not apply to the policy forms for major medical insurance coverage or to the
6 rate and policy form review process for policies for specific disease, accident,
7 injury, hospital indemnity, dental care, vision care, disability income, long-
8 term care, student health insurance coverage, Medicare supplement insurance
9 coverage, or other limited benefit coverage; to short-term, limited-duration
10 health insurance coverage; or to benefit plans that are paid directly to an
11 individual insured or to the individual’s assigns and for which the amount of
12 the benefit is not based on potential medical costs or actual costs incurred.
13 Premium rates and rules for the classification of risk for Medicare supplement
14 insurance policies shall be governed by section 4051 of this title.
15 (2) The policy forms for major medical insurance coverage, as well as
16 the policy forms, premium rates, and rules for the classification of risk for the
17 other lines of insurance described in subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be
18 reviewed and approved or disapproved by the Commissioner. In making a
19 determination, the Commissioner shall consider whether a policy form,
20 premium rate, or rule is affordable and is not unjust, unfair, inequitable,
21 misleading, or contrary to the laws of this State; and, for a policy form for
VT LEG #382889 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 23 of 181
1 major medical insurance coverage, whether it ensures equal access to
2 appropriate mental health care in a manner equivalent to other aspects of health
3 care as part of an integrated, holistic system of care. The Commissioner shall
4 make a determination within 30 days after the date the insurer filed the policy
5 form, premium rate, or rule with the Department. At the expiration of the 30-
6 day period, the form, premium rate, or rule shall be deemed approved unless
7 prior to then it has been affirmatively approved or disapproved by the
8 Commissioner or found to be incomplete. The Commissioner shall notify a
9 health insurer in writing if the insurer files any form, premium rate, or rule
10 containing a provision that does not meet the standards expressed in this
11 subsection. In such notice, the Commissioner shall state that a hearing will be
12 granted within 20 days upon the insurer’s written request.
13 (i) Notwithstanding the procedures and timelines set forth in subsections
14 (a) through (e) of this section, the Board may establish, by rule, a streamlined
15 rate review process for certain rate decisions, including proposed rates
16 affecting fewer than a minimum number of covered lives and proposed rates
17 for which a de minimis increase, as defined by the Board by rule, is sought.
18 § 4027. FILING FEES
19 Each filing of a policy, contract, or document form or premium rates or
20 rules, submitted pursuant to section 4026 of this title, shall be accompanied by

6 met:
7 (1) The policy sets forth all of the monetary and other considerations for
8 the policy.
9 (2) The policy sets forth the time at which the insurance takes effect and
10 terminates.
11 (3) The policy purports to insure only one person, except that a policy
12 may insure, originally or by subsequent amendment, upon the application of an
13 adult member of a family who shall be deemed the policyholder, any two or
14 more eligible members of that family, including a spouse or civil union
15 partner, dependent children or any children under a specified age that shall not
16 exceed 26 years of age, and any other person dependent upon the policyholder.
17 (4) The style, arrangement, and overall appearance of the policy give no
18 undue prominence to any portion of the text, and every printed portion of the
19 text of the policy and of any endorsements or attached papers is plainly printed
20 in light-faced type of a style in general use, the size of which shall be uniform
21 and not less than 10-point with a lowercase unspaced alphabet length not less
VT LEG #382889 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 25 of 181

2 matter except the name and address of the insurer; the name or title of the
3 policy; the brief description, if any; and the captions and subcaptions.
4 (5) The exceptions and reductions of indemnity are set forth in the
5 policy and, except those that are set forth in sections 4029 and 4030 of this
6 title, are printed, at the insurer’s option, either with the benefit provision to
7 which they apply or under an appropriate caption such as “EXCEPTIONS” or
8 “EXCEPTIONS AND REDUCTIONS”; provided, however, that if an
9 exception or reduction specifically applies only to a particular benefit of the
10 policy, the statement of the exception or reduction shall be included with the
11 benefit provision to which it applies.
12 (6) Each policy form, including riders and endorsements, is identified by
13 a form number in the lower left-hand corner of the first page of the form.
14 (7) The policy does not contain any provision purporting to make any
15 portion of the charter, rules, constitution, or bylaws of the health insurer a part
16 of the policy unless that portion is set forth in full in the policy, except in the
17 case of the incorporation of, or reference to, a statement of rates or
18 classification of risks or a short-rate table filed with the Commissioner.
19 (8) Either prominently printed on or attached to the first page of the
20 policy is a notice to the effect that during a period of 30 days following the
21 date the policy is delivered to persons eligible for Medicare by reason of age,
VT LEG #382889 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 26 of 181
1 and 10 days following the date of delivery to all other persons, the policy may
2 be surrendered to the insurer together with a written request for cancellation of
3 the policy, and that in such event, the insurer will refund any premium paid,
4 including any policy fees or other charges; provided, however, that this
5 subdivision shall not apply to single premium nonrenewable policies insuring
6 against accident only or medical costs or accidental bodily injury only.
7 § 4029. REQUIRED STANDARD POLICY PROVISIONS
8 Except as provided in section 4031 of this title, each health insurance policy
9 delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State shall contain the
10 provisions specified in this section using the language set forth in this section;
11 provided, however, that a health insurer may, at its option, substitute different
12 language approved by the Commissioner for one or more provisions, provided
13 the substituted language is not less favorable in any respect to the insured or
14 covered individual than the language used in this section. The provisions
15 specified in this section shall be preceded individually by the caption appearing
16 in this section or, at the option of the health insurer, by such appropriate
17 captions or subcaptions as the Commissioner may approve:
18 (1) ENTIRE CONTRACT; CHANGES: This policy, including the
19 endorsements and the attached papers, if any, constitutes the entire contract of
20 insurance. No change in this policy shall be valid until approved by an
21 executive officer of the insurer and unless such approval be endorsed hereon or
VT LEG #382889 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 27 of 181
1 attached hereto. No agent has authority to change this policy or to waive any
2 of its provisions.
3 (2) TIME LIMIT ON CERTAIN DEFENSES: (a) After three years
4 from the date of issue of this policy no misstatements, except fraudulent
5 misstatements, made by the applicant in the application for such policy, shall
6 be used to void the policy or to deny a claim for loss incurred or disability (as
7 defined in the policy) commencing after the expiration of such three-year
8 period.
9 (The foregoing policy provision shall not be so construed as to affect any
10 legal requirement for avoidance of a policy or denial of a claim during such
11 initial three-year period, nor to limit the application of subdivisions 4030(1)–
12 (5) of this title in the event of misstatement with respect to age or occupation
13 or other insurance.) (A policy which the insured has the right to continue in
14 force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premium (1) until at least
15 age 50, or (2) in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years
16 from its date of issue, may contain in lieu of the foregoing the following
17 provision (from which the clause in parentheses may be omitted at the
18 insurer’s option) under the caption “INCONTESTABLE”:
19 After this policy has been in force for a period of three years during the
20 lifetime of the insured (excluding any period during which the insured is
VT LEG #382889 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 28 of 181
1 disabled), it shall become incontestable as to the statements contained in the
2 application.)
3 (b) No claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy)
4 commencing after three years from the date of issue of this policy shall be
5 reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition not
6 excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective on the date
7 of loss had existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this policy.
8 (3) GRACE PERIOD: A grace period of . . . . (insert a number not less
9 than “7” for weekly premium policies, “10” for monthly premium policies and
10 “31” for all other policies) days will be granted for the payment of each
11 premium falling due after the first premium, during which grace period the
12 policy shall continue in force.
13 (A policy which contains a cancellation provision may add, at the end of
14 the above provision,
15 subject to the right of the insurer to cancel in accordance with the
16 cancellation provision hereof,
17 A policy in which the insurer reserves the right to refuse any renewal
18 shall have, at the beginning of the above provision,
19 Unless not less than five days prior to the premium due date the insurer has
20 delivered to the insured or has mailed to his or her last address as shown by the
VT LEG #382889 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 29 of 181
1 records of the insurer written notice of its intention not to renew this policy
2 beyond the period for which the premium has been accepted.)
3 (4) REINSTATEMENT: If any renewal premium be not paid within the
4 time granted the insured for payment, a subsequent acceptance of premium by
5 the insurer or by any agent duly authorized by the insurer to accept such
6 premium, without requiring in connection therewith an application for
7 reinstatement, shall reinstate the policy; provided, however, that if the insurer
8 or such agent requires an application for reinstatement and issues a conditional
9 receipt for the premium tendered, the policy will be reinstated upon approval
10 of such application by the insurer or, lacking such approval, upon the 45th day
11 following the date of such conditional receipt unless the insurer has previously
12 notified the insured in writing of its disapproval of such application. The
13 reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from such accidental injury as
14 may be sustained after the date of reinstatement and loss due to such sickness
15 as may begin more than ten days after such date. In all other respects the
16 insured and insurer shall have the same rights thereunder as they had under the
17 policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to
18 any provisions endorsed hereon or attached hereto in connection with the
19 reinstatement. Any premium accepted in connection with a reinstatement shall
20 be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not
21 to any period more than sixty days prior to the date of reinstatement.

1 (The last sentence of the above provision may be omitted from any
2 policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms
3 by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50, or (2) in the case
4 of a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue.)
5 (5) NOTICE OF CLAIM: Written notice of claim must be given to the
6 insurer within 20 days after the occurrence or commencement of any loss
7 covered by the policy, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible. Notice
8 given by or on behalf of the insured or the beneficiary to the insurer at . . . .
9 (insert the location of such office as the insurer may designate for the purpose),
10 or to any authorized agent of the insurer, with information sufficient to identify
11 the insured, shall be deemed notice to the insurer.
12 (In a policy providing a loss-of-time benefit which may be payable for at
13 least two years, an insurer may at its option insert the following between the
14 first and second sentences of the above provision:
15 Subject to the qualifications set forth below, if the insured suffers loss of
16 time on account of disability for which indemnity may be payable for at least
17 two years, he or she shall, at least once in every six months after having given
18 notice of claim, give to the insurer notice of continuance of said disability,
19 except in the event of legal incapacity. The period of six months following any
20 filing of proof by the insured or any payment by the insurer on account of such
21 claim or any denial of liability in whole or in part by the insurer shall be

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 31 of 181
1 excluded in applying this provision. Delay in the giving of such notice shall
2 not impair the insured’s right to any indemnity which would otherwise have
3 accrued during the period of six months preceding the date on which such
4 notice is actually given.)
5 (6) CLAIM FORMS: The insurer, upon receipt of a notice of claim, will
6 furnish to the claimant such forms as are usually furnished by it for filing
7 proofs of loss. If such forms are not furnished within 15 days after the giving
8 of such notice the claimant shall be deemed to have complied with the
9 requirements of this policy as to proof of loss upon submitting, within the time
10 fixed in the policy for filing proofs of loss, written proof covering the
11 occurrence, the character and the extent of the loss for which claim is made.
12 (7) PROOFS OF LOSS: Written proof of loss must be furnished to the
13 insurer at its said office in case of claim for loss for which this policy provides
14 any periodic payment contingent upon continuing loss within 90 days after the
15 termination of the period for which the insurer is liable and in case of claim for
16 any other loss within 90 days after the date of such loss. Failure to furnish
17 such proof within the time required shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if
18 it was not reasonably possible to give proof within such time, provided such
19 proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the
20 absence of legal capacity, later than one year from the time proof is otherwise
21 required.

1 (8) TIME OF PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Indemnities payable under this
2 policy for any loss other than loss for which this policy provides any periodic
3 payment will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof of such
4 loss. Subject to due written proof of loss, all accrued indemnities for loss for
5 which this policy provides periodic payment will be paid . . . . (insert period for
6 payment which must not be less frequently than monthly) and any balance
7 remaining unpaid upon the termination of liability will be paid immediately
8 upon receipt of due written proof.
9 (9) PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Indemnity for loss of life will be payable in
10 accordance with the beneficiary designation and the provisions respecting such
11 payment which may be prescribed herein and effective at the time of payment.
12 If no such designation or provision is then effective, such indemnity shall be
13 payable to the estate of the insured. Any other accrued indemnities unpaid at
14 the insured’s death may, at the option of the insurer, be paid either to such
15 beneficiary or to such estate. All other indemnities will be payable to the
16 insured.
17 (The following provisions, or either of them, may be included with the
18 foregoing provision at the option of the insurer:
19 If any indemnity of this policy shall be payable to the estate of the insured,
20 or to an insured or beneficiary who is a minor or otherwise not competent to
21 give a valid release, the insurer may pay such indemnity, up to an amount not

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30

1 exceeding $. . . . . . (insert an amount which shall not exceed $1,000.00), to any
2 relative by blood or connection by civil marriage of the insured or beneficiary
3 who is deemed by the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto. Any payment
4 made by the insurer in good faith pursuant to this provision shall fully
5 discharge the insurer to the extent of such payment.
6 Subject to any written direction of the insured in the application or
7 otherwise all or a portion of any indemnities provided by this policy on
8 account of hospital, nursing, medical, or surgical services may, at the insurer’s
9 option and unless the insured requests otherwise in writing not later than the
10 time of filing proofs of such loss, be paid directly to the hospital or person
11 rendering such services; but it is not required that the service be rendered by a
12 particular hospital or person.)
13 (10) PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS AND AUTOPSY: The insurer at its
14 own expense shall have the right and the opportunity to examine the person of
15 the insured when and as often as it may reasonably require during the
16 pendency of a claim hereunder and to make an autopsy in case of death where
17 it is not forbidden by law.
18 (11) LEGAL ACTIONS: No action at law or in equity shall be brought to
19 recover on this policy prior to the expiration of 60 days after written proof of
20 loss has been furnished in accordance with the requirements of this policy. No

1 such action shall be brought after the expiration of three years after the time
2 written proof of loss is required to be furnished.
3 (12) CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY: Unless the insured makes an
4 irrevocable designation of beneficiary, the right to change of beneficiary is
5 reserved to the insured and the consent of the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall
6 not be requisite to surrender or assignment of this policy or to any change of
7 beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to any other changes in this policy.
8 (The first clause of this provision, relative to the irrevocable designation
9 of beneficiary, may be omitted at the insurer’s option.)
10 § 4030. OPTIONAL STANDARD POLICY PROVISIONS
11 Except as provided in section 4031 of this title, no health insurance policy
12 delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State shall contain
13 provisions respecting the matters set forth in this section unless the provisions
14 use the language set forth in this section; provided, however, that a health
15 insurer may, at its option, substitute different language approved by the
16 Commissioner for one or more provisions, provided the substituted language is
17 not less favorable in any respect to the insured or covered individual than the
18 language used in this section. Any provision set forth in this section that is
19 contained in the policy shall be preceded individually by the appropriate
20 caption appearing in this section or, at the option of the health insurer, by such
21 appropriate captions or subcaptions as the Commissioner may approve:
VT LEG #382889 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 35 of 181
1 (1) CHANGE OF OCCUPATION: If the insured be injured or contract
2 sickness after having changed his or her occupation to one classified by the
3 insurer as more hazardous than that stated in this policy or while doing for
4 compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so classified, the insurer
5 will pay only such portion of the indemnities provided in this policy as the
6 premium paid would have purchased at the rates and within the limits fixed by
7 the insurer for such more hazardous occupation. If the insured changes his or
8 her occupation to one classified by the insurer as less hazardous than that
9 stated in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of such change of
10 occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly, and will return the
11 excess pro rata unearned premium from the date of change of occupation or
12 from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of such proof,
13 whichever is the more recent. In applying this provision, the classification of
14 occupational risk and the premium rates shall be such as have been last filed by
15 the insurer prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable or
16 prior to date of proof of change in occupation with the state official having
17 supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided at the time this
18 policy was issued; but if such filing was not required, then the classification of
19 occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by
20 the insurer in such state prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the date
21 of proof of change in occupation.

1 (2) MISSTATEMENT OF AGE: If the age of the insured has been
2 misstated, all amounts payable under this policy shall be such as the premium
3 paid would have purchased at the correct age.
4 (3) OTHER INSURANCE IN THIS INSURER: If an accident or
5 sickness or accident and sickness policy or policies previously issued by the
6 insurer to the insured be in force concurrently herewith, making the aggregate
7 indemnity for .... (insert type of coverage or coverages) in excess of $
8 .................... (insert maximum limit of indemnity or indemnities) the excess
9 insurance shall be void and all premiums paid for such excess shall be returned
10 to the insured or to his or her estate.
11 or, in lieu thereof:
12 Insurance effective at any one time on the insured under a like policy or
13 policies in this insurer is limited to the one such policy elected by the insured,
14 his or her beneficiary or his or her estate, as the case may be, and the insurer
15 will return all premiums paid for all other such policies.
16 (4) INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS: If there be other valid
17 coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a
18 provision of service basis or on an expense incurred basis and of which this
19 insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or
20 commencement of loss, the only liability under any expense incurred coverage
21 of this policy shall be for such proportion of the loss as the amount which
VT LEG #382889 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 37 of 181
1 would otherwise have been payable hereunder plus the total of the like
2 amounts under all such other valid coverages for the same loss of which this
3 insurer had notice bears to the total like amounts under all valid coverages for
4 such loss, and for the return of such portion of the premiums paid as shall
5 exceed the pro rata portion for the amount so determined. For the purpose of
6 applying this provision when other coverage is on a provision of service basis,
7 the “like amount” of such other coverage shall be taken as the amount which
8 the services rendered would have cost in the absence of such coverage.
9 (If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also
10 contains the next following policy provision there shall be added to the caption
11 of the foregoing provision the phrase “—EXPENSE INCURRED
12 BENEFITS.” The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a
13 definition of “other valid coverage,” approved as to form by the
14 Commissioner, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage
15 provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by
16 insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any
17 province of Canada, and by hospital or medical service organizations, and to
18 any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the
19 Commissioner. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include
20 group insurance, automobile medical payments insurance, or coverage
21 provided by hospital or medical service organizations or by union welfare

1 plans or employer or employee benefit organizations. For the purpose of
2 applying the foregoing policy provision with respect to any insured, any
3 amount of benefit provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory
4 benefit statute (including any workers’ compensation or employer’s liability
5 statute) whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise shall in all
6 cases be deemed to be “other valid coverage” of which the insurer has had
7 notice. In applying the foregoing policy provision no third party liability
8 coverage shall be included as “other valid coverage.”)
9 (5) INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS: If there be other valid
10 coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on other
11 than an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given
12 written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only
13 liability for such benefits under this policy shall be for such proportion of the
14 indemnities otherwise provided hereunder for such loss as the like indemnities
15 of which the insurer had notice (including the indemnities under this policy)
16 bear to the total amount of all like indemnities for such loss, and for the return
17 of such portion of the premium paid as shall exceed the pro rata portion for the
18 indemnities thus determined.
19 (If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also
20 contains the next preceding policy provision there shall be added to the caption
21 of the foregoing provision the phrase “—OTHER BENEFITS.” The insurer

1 may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “other valid
2 coverage,” approved as to form by the Commissioner, which definition shall be
3 limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to
4 regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other
5 state of the United States or any province of Canada, and to any other coverage
6 the inclusion of which may be approved by the Commissioner. In the absence
7 of such definition such term shall not include group insurance, or benefits
8 provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit
9 organizations. For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy provision with
10 respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such insured
11 pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers’
12 compensation or employer’s liability statute) whether provided by a
13 governmental agency or otherwise shall in all cases be deemed to be “other
14 valid coverage” of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing
15 policy provision no third party liability coverage shall be included as “other
16 valid coverage.”)
17 (6) RELATION OF EARNINGS TO INSURANCE: If the total monthly
18 amount of loss of time benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss
19 of time coverage upon the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly
20 basis, shall exceed the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability
21 commenced or his or her average monthly earnings for the period of two years
VT LEG #382889 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 40 of 181
1 immediately preceding a disability for which claim is made, whichever is the
2 greater, the insurer will be liable only for such proportionate amount of such
3 benefits under this policy as the amount of such monthly earnings or such
4 average monthly earnings of the insured bears to the total amount of monthly
5 benefits for the same loss under all such coverage upon the insured at the time
6 such disability commences and for the return of such part of the premiums paid
7 during such two years as shall exceed the pro rata amount of the premiums for
8 the benefits actually paid hereunder; but this shall not operate to reduce the
9 total monthly amount of benefits payable under all such coverage upon the
10 insured below the sum of $200.00 or the sum of the monthly benefits specified
11 in such coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to reduce
12 benefits other than those payable for loss of time.
13 (The foregoing policy provision may be inserted only in a policy which
14 the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely
15 payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50; or (2) in the case of a policy
16 issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue. The insurer
17 may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “valid loss of time
18 coverage,” approved as to form by the Commissioner, which definition shall be
19 limited in subject matter to coverage provided by governmental agencies or by
20 organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities
21 of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, or to
VT LEG #382889 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 41 of 181
1 any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the
2 Commissioner or any combination of such coverages. In the absence of such
3 definition such term shall not include any coverage provided for such insured
4 pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers’
5 compensation or employer’s liability statute), or benefits provided by union
6 welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations.)
7 (7) UNPAID PREMIUM: Upon the payment of a claim under this policy,
8 any premium then due and unpaid or covered by any note or written order may
9 be deducted therefrom.
10 (8) CANCELLATION: The insurer may cancel this policy at any time by
11 written notice delivered to the insured, or mailed to his or her last address as
12 shown by the records of the insurer, stating when, not less than five days
13 thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective; and after the policy has been
14 continued beyond its original term the insured may cancel this policy at any
15 time by written notice delivered or mailed to the insurer, effective upon receipt
16 or on such later date as may be specified in such notice. In the event of
17 cancellation, the insurer will return promptly the unearned portion of any
18 premium paid. If the insured cancels, the earned premium shall be computed
19 by the use of the short-rate table last filed with the state official having
20 supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided when the policy
21 was issued. If the insurer cancels, the earned premium shall be computed pro
VT LEG #382889 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 42 of 181
1 rata. Cancellation shall be without prejudice to any claim originating prior to
2 the effective date of cancellation.
3 (9) CONFORMITY WITH STATE STATUTES: Any provision of this
4 policy which, on its effective date, is in conflict with the statutes of the state in
5 which the insured resides on such date is hereby amended to conform to the
6 minimum requirements of such statutes.
7 (10) ILLEGAL OCCUPATION: The insurer shall not be liable for any
8 loss to which a contributing cause was the insured’s commission of or attempt
9 to commit a felony or to which a contributing cause was the insured’s being
10 engaged in an illegal occupation.
11 § 4031. OMISSION OF INAPPLICABLE OR INCONSISTENT
12 STANDARD PROVISIONS
13 If any provision of sections 4029 and 4030 of this title is in whole or in part
14 inapplicable to or inconsistent with the coverage provided by a particular form
15 of policy, the health insurer, with the approval of the Commissioner, shall omit
16 from such policy any inapplicable provision or part of a provision, and shall
17 modify any inconsistent provision or part of the provision in such manner as to
18 make the provision as contained in the policy consistent with the coverage
19 provided by the policy.

1 § 4032. ORDER OF STANDARD POLICY PROVISIONS
2 The provisions specified in sections 4029 and 4030 of this title, or any
3 corresponding provisions used in lieu of those provisions as permitted by those
4 sections, shall either be printed in the same order as the provisions are set forth
5 in those sections or, at the option of the health insurer, any such provision may
6 appear as a unit in any part of the policy, with other provisions to which it may
7 be logically related, provided the resulting policy shall not be in whole or in
8 part unintelligible, uncertain, ambiguous, abstruse, or likely to mislead a
9 person to whom the policy is offered, delivered, or issued.
10 § 4033. DISCRETIONARY CLAUSES PROHIBITED
11 (a) The purpose of this section is to ensure that health insurance benefits,
12 disability income protection coverage, and life insurance benefits are
13 contractually guaranteed and to avoid the conflict of interest that may occur
14 when the carrier responsible for providing benefits has discretionary authority
15 to decide what benefits are due. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
16 impose any requirement or duty on any person other than a health insurer or a
17 health insurer offering disability income protection coverage or life insurance.

2025 Page 44 of 181
1 payments for a specified period during the continuance of disability resulting
2 from illness, injury, or a combination of illness and injury.
3 (2) “Health insurer” has the same meaning as in section 4021 of this
4 chapter and, as used in this section, also includes entities offering policies for
5 specific disease, accident, injury, hospital indemnity, dental care, disability
6 income, long-term care, and other limited benefit coverage.
7 (3) “Life insurance” means a policy, contract, certificate, or agreement
8 that provides life insurance as defined in subdivision 3301(a)(1) of this title.
9 (c) No policy, contract, certificate, or agreement offered or issued in this
10 State by a health insurer to provide, deliver, arrange for, pay for, or reimburse
11 any of the costs of health care services may contain a provision purporting to
12 reserve discretion to the health insurer to interpret the terms of the contract or
13 to provide standards of interpretation or review that are inconsistent with the
14 laws of this State, and any such provision in a policy, contract, certificate, or
15 agreement shall be null and void.
16 (d) No policy, contract, certificate, or agreement offered or issued in this
17 State providing for disability income protection coverage may contain a
18 provision purporting to reserve discretion to the insurer to interpret the terms
19 of the contract or to provide standards of interpretation or review that are
20 inconsistent with the laws of this State, and any such provision in a policy,
21 contract, certificate, or agreement shall be null and void.

1 (e) No policy, contract, certificate, or agreement of life insurance offered or
2 issued in this State shall contain a provision purporting to reserve discretion to

5 any such provision in a policy, contract, certificate, or agreement shall be null
6 and void.
7 § 4034. REQUIREMENTS OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS
8 (a) Any policy of a foreign or alien insurer, when delivered or issued for
9 delivery to any person in this State, may contain any provision that is not less
10 favorable to the covered individual than the provisions of this chapter and that
11 is prescribed or required by the law of the state under which the insurer is
12 organized.
13 (b) Any policy of a domestic health insurer, when issued for delivery in any
14 other state or country, may contain any provision permitted or required by the
15 laws of such other state or country.
16 § 4035. POLICIES NOT AFFECTED
17 Nothing in sections 4018–4020, 4023, 4028–4032, 4034, 4036, and 4037 of
18 this title shall apply to or affect:
19 (1) any policy of workers’ compensation insurance or any policy of
20 liability insurance, with or without supplementary coverage;

5 (4) life insurance, endowment, or annuity contracts, or contracts
6 supplemental to those contracts, that contain only such provisions relating to
7 accident and sickness insurance as:
8 (A) provide additional benefits in case of death or dismemberment or
9 loss of sight by accident; or
10 (B) operate to safeguard the contracts against lapse or to give a
11 special surrender value or special benefit or an annuity in the event that the
12 insured or annuitant becomes totally and permanently disabled, as defined by
13 the contract or supplemental contract.
14 § 4036. NONCONFORMING POLICIES
15 (a) A health insurance policy shall not contain any provision that makes the
16 policy or any portion of the policy less favorable in any respect to the covered
17 individual than the provisions of the policy that are regulated by sections 4029
18 and 4030 of this title.
19 (b) A policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State in
20 violation of sections 4029 and 4030 of this title shall be held valid but shall be
21 construed as provided in this chapter. When any provision in a policy
VT LEG #382889 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 47 of 181
1 regulated by sections 4029 and 4030 is in conflict with any provision of those
2 sections, the rights, duties, and obligations of the health insurer and the
3 covered individual shall be governed by the provisions of those sections.
4 § 4037. APPLICATIONS FOR INSURANCE
5 (a)(1) A covered individual shall not be bound by any statement made in an
6 application for a policy unless a copy of the application is attached to or
7 endorsed on the policy as a part of the policy when issued.
8 (2) If a policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State
9 is reinstated or renewed and the covered individual or assignee of the policy
10 makes a written request to the health insurer for a copy of the application, if
11 any, for such reinstatement or renewal, the health insurer shall deliver or mail a
12 copy of the application to the individual making the request within 15 days
13 after the receipt of the request. If the health insurer does not deliver or mail the
14 copy within 15 days, the health insurer shall be precluded from introducing the
15 application as evidence in any action or proceeding based on or involving the
16 policy or its reinstatement or renewal.
17 (b) No alteration of a written application for a policy shall be made by any
18 person other than the applicant without the applicant’s written consent, except
19 that insertions may be made by the health insurer, for administrative purposes
20 only, in a manner that indicates clearly that the insertions are not to be ascribed
21 to the applicant.

1 (c) The falsity of any statement in an application for a policy shall not bar
2 the right to recovery under the policy unless the false statement materially
3 affected either the acceptance of the risk or the hazard assumed by the health
4 insurer.
5 § 4038. RULEMAKING ON POLICY FILINGS
6 The Commissioner may adopt such reasonable rules concerning the
7 procedure for the filing or submission of policies subject to sections 4023 and
8 4028–4030 of this title as are necessary, proper, or advisable for the
9 administration of these sections. This provision shall not abridge any other

13 (B)(i) In the event that the federal government does not establish an
14 annual limitation on cost sharing for any plan year, the annual limitation on

15 insurance policies.
16 (2) The Commissioner shall adopt rules for standards and procedure for

19 premium charged shall not deviate from the community rate and the rules shall
20 not permit medical underwriting and screening, except that a health insurer
21 may set different community rates for persons eligible for Medicare by reason
VT LEG #382889 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 69 of 181
1 of age and persons eligible for Medicare by reason of disability.
2 (b) Premium increases.
3 (1) Within five days after receiving a request for approval of any
4 composite average rate increase in excess of three percent, or any other
5 coverage changes that the Commissioner determines will have a comparable
6 impact on cost or availability of coverage for a Medicare supplement insurance
7 policy issued by any health insurer with 5,000 or more total lives in the
8 Vermont Medicare supplement insurance market, the Commissioner shall
9 notify the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent Living of the
10 proposed premium increase. A composite average rate is the enrollment-
11 weighted average rate increase of all plans offered by a health insurer.
12 (2) Within five days after receiving notification pursuant to subdivision
13 (1) of this subsection, the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent
14 Living shall inform the members of the Advisory Board established pursuant to
15 33 V.S.A. § 505 of the proposed premium increase.
16 (3)(A) The Commissioner shall not approve any request to increase
17 Medicare supplement insurance premium rates unless the amount of the rate
18 increase complies with the statutory standards for approval under sections
19 4026, 4513, 4584, and 5104 of this title. Any approved rate increase shall not
20 be based on an unreasonable change in loss ratio from the previous year, unless
21 the Commissioner makes written findings that such change is necessary to
VT LEG #382889 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 70 of 181
1 prevent a substantial adverse impact on the financial condition of the health
2 insurer. In acting on such rate increase requests, the Commissioner may deny
3 the request, approve the rate increase as requested, or approve a rate increase in
4 an amount different from the increase requested. A decision by the
5 Commissioner other than an approval of the rate requested may be appealed by
6 the health insurer, provided that the burden of proof shall be on the health
7 insurer to show that the approved rate does not meet the statutory standards
8 established under this subsection.
9 (B) Before acting on the rate increase requested, the Commissioner
10 may make such examination or investigation as the Commissioner deems
11 necessary, including where applicable the review process set forth in
12 subdivision (C) of this subdivision (3).
13 (C)(i) In reviewing any Medicare supplement insurance rate increase
14 for which an independent analysis has been performed pursuant to 33 V.S.A.
15 § 6706 and in which the health insurer’s requested composite average increase,
16 the independent expert’s recommended composite average rate increase, or the
17 Department actuary’s recommended composite average rate increase differ by
18 two percentage points or more, the Commissioner shall hold a public hearing at
19 which the health insurer, the Department’s actuary, the independent expert, any
20 intervenor, and the public will have the opportunity to present written and oral
VT LEG #382889 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 71 of 181
1 testimony and will be available to answer questions of the Commissioner and
2 those present.
3 (ii) The hearing shall be noticed and held at a time and place so as
4 to facilitate public participation, and shall be recorded and become part of the
5 record before the Commissioner. At the Commissioner’s discretion, the
6 hearing may be conducted remotely.
7 (iii) If the carrier’s requested composite average increase, the
8 independent expert’s recommended composite average increase, or the
9 Department actuary’s recommended composite average increase differs by less
10 than two percentage points, the Department and the parties shall confer by
11 conference call, or by any other available media, to review the rate requests
12 and recommendations. However, a public hearing may be held at the
13 Commissioner’s discretion for good cause shown.
14 (D)(i) In any review held in accordance with this subdivision (3), the
15 Commissioner shall permit intervention by any person whom the
16 Commissioner determines will materially advance the interests of the covered
17 individuals. The intervenor shall have access to and may use the information
18 of the independent expert appointed under 33 V.S.A. § 6706.
19 (ii) The reasonable and necessary cost of intervention as
20 determined by the Commissioner shall be paid by the affected policyholders or
21 certificate holders. The maximum payment shall be $2,500.00 except when
VT LEG #382889 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 72 of 181
1 waived by the Commissioner for good cause shown. The $2,500.00 maximum
2 amount may be adjusted to reflect, at the Commissioner’s discretion,
3 appropriate inflation factors.
4 (E) Nonproprietary, relevant information in any Medicare
5 supplement insurance rate filing, including any analysis by the Department’s
6 actuary and the independent expert, shall be made available to the public upon
7 request.
8 (c) Disability.
9 (1) A health insurer that issues Medicare supplement insurance policies
10 or certificates to a person eligible for Medicare by reason of age shall make
11 available, to persons eligible for Medicare by reason of disability, the same
12 policies or certificates that are offered and sold to persons eligible for
13 Medicare by reason of age. The initial enrollment period for any such policies
14 or certificates shall be at least six months following the date the individual
15 becomes eligible for Medicare by reason of disability. Any additional
16 enrollment periods as required by law and offered to individuals eligible by
17 reason of age shall be offered to individuals eligible by reason of disability.
18 (2) This subsection does not apply to persons eligible for Medicare by
19 reason of end stage renal disease.
20 (d) Outreach and education. The Department of Financial Regulation shall
21 collaborate with health insurers, advocates for older Vermonters and for other

5 networks.
6 § 4052. BLANKET HEALTH INSURANCE
7 (a) Blanket health insurance is a form of health insurance that, to the extent
8 permitted under federal law, is supplemental to major medical health insurance
9 or provides coverage other than the payment of all or a portion of the cost of
10 health care services or products, and that covers special groups of persons as
11 follows:

13 be deemed the policyholder, covering a group defined as all persons who may
14 become passengers on such common carrier;

16 deemed the policyholder, covering any group of employees defined by
17 reference to exceptional hazards incident to such employment;

2 provider, who or which shall be deemed the policyholder, covering students or
3 teachers, or both;
4 (4) under a policy or contract issued in the name of any volunteer fire
5 department, emergency medical services provider, or other such volunteer
6 group, which shall be deemed the policyholder, covering all of the members of
7 the department or group in connection with their department or group
8 activities; or
9 (5) under a policy or contract issued to any other substantially similar
10 group that, in the discretion of the Commissioner and after the prior approval
11 by the Commissioner of the group, may be subject to the issuance of a blanket
12 health policy or contract.
13 (b)(1) No blanket health insurance policy shall contain any provision
14 relating to notice of claim, proofs of loss, time of payment of claims, or time
15 within which legal action must be brought upon the policy that, in the opinion
16 of the Commissioner, is less favorable to the persons insured than would be
17 permitted by the provisions set forth in section 4029 of this title.
18 (2) An individual application shall not be required from a person
19 covered under a blanket health policy or contract, nor shall it be necessary for
20 the insurer to furnish each person a certificate.

1 (3) All benefits under any blanket health policy shall, unless for hospital
2 and physician service or surgical benefits, be payable to the person insured, or
3 to the person’s designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to the person’s
4 estate, except that if the person insured is a minor, the benefits may be made
5 payable to the minor’s parent, guardian, or other person actually supporting the
6 minor.
7 (4) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the legal liability of
8 policyholders for the death of, or injury to, any members of the group.
9 (c) No blanket health insurance policy that provides coverage for the
10 payment of all or a portion of the cost of health care services or products shall
11 contain any provision that does not comply with a requirement of this title, or a
12 rule adopted pursuant to this title applicable to health insurance, other than
13 those requirements applicable to nongroup health insurance or small group
14 health insurance. The Commissioner may waive the application to a blanket
15 insurance policy of one or more of the health insurance requirements of this
16 title, or a rule adopted pursuant to this title, if the requirement is not relevant to
17 the types of risks and duration of risks insured against in the blanket insurance

9 be nonrenewable, and a health insurer shall not issue a short-term, limited-
10 duration health insurance policy or contract to any person if the issuance would
11 result in the person being covered by short-term, limited-duration health
12 insurance coverage for more than three months in any 12-month period.

14 coverage shall display prominently in the policy or contract and in any

8 the following characteristics:

7 covered individual warrant a waiver or reduction. The application fee shall be
8 paid by the health insurer, not the covered individual, if the independent
9 review organization reverses the health insurer’s decision to deny payment for
10 a health care service.
11 (D) Be protected from retaliation for exercising the covered
12 individual’s right to an independent external review under this section.

10 exemption shall not apply where an action is brought to recover for necessaries
11 contracted for during the period of disability and the writ or bill of complaint
12 contains a statement to that effect. When a policy provides for a lump sum
13 payment because of a dismemberment or other loss insured, the payment shall
14 be exempt from execution of the covered individual’s creditors.
15 § 4018. THIRD-PARTY OWNERSHIP
16 Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as preventing a person other than

10 not be effective, and if that date falls within a period for which the health
11 insurer has accepted a premium or if the health insurer accepts a premium after

16 contrary, if the age of the covered individual has been misstated and if,
17 according to the correct age of the covered individual, the coverage provided
18 by the policy would not have become effective or would have ceased prior to
19 the health insurer’s acceptance of the premium or premiums, then the health

8 the policy.
9 (2) The policy sets forth the time at which the insurance takes effect and
10 terminates.
11 (3) The policy purports to insure only one person, except that a policy
12 may insure, originally or by subsequent amendment, upon the application of an
13 adult member of a family who shall be deemed the policyholder, any two or
14 more eligible members of that family, including a spouse or civil union
15 partner, dependent children or any children under a specified age that shall not
16 exceed 26 years of age, and any other person dependent upon the policyholder.
17 (4) The style, arrangement, and overall appearance of the policy give no
18 undue prominence to any portion of the text, and every printed portion of the
19 text of the policy and of any endorsements or attached papers is plainly printed

8 “EXCEPTIONS AND REDUCTIONS”; provided, however, that if an
9 exception or reduction specifically applies only to a particular benefit of the
10 policy, the statement of the exception or reduction shall be included with the

17 case of the incorporation of, or reference to, a statement of rates or
18 classification of risks or a short-rate table filed with the Commissioner.

1 and 10 days following the date of delivery to all other persons, the policy may
2 be surrendered to the insurer together with a written request for cancellation of
3 the policy, and that in such event, the insurer will refund any premium paid,
4 including any policy fees or other charges; provided, however, that this
5 subdivision shall not apply to single premium nonrenewable policies insuring
6 against accident only or medical costs or accidental bodily injury only.
7 § 4029. REQUIRED STANDARD POLICY PROVISIONS
8 Except as provided in section 4031 of this title, each health insurance policy
9 delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State shall contain the
10 provisions specified in this section using the language set forth in this section;
11 provided, however, that a health insurer may, at its option, substitute different
12 language approved by the Commissioner for one or more provisions, provided
13 the substituted language is not less favorable in any respect to the insured or
14 covered individual than the language used in this section. The provisions
15 specified in this section shall be preceded individually by the caption appearing
16 in this section or, at the option of the health insurer, by such appropriate
17 captions or subcaptions as the Commissioner may approve:
18 (1) ENTIRE CONTRACT; CHANGES: This policy, including the
19 endorsements and the attached papers, if any, constitutes the entire contract of
20 insurance. No change in this policy shall be valid until approved by an
21 executive officer of the insurer and unless such approval be endorsed hereon or

1 attached hereto. No agent has authority to change this policy or to waive any
2 of its provisions.
3 (2) TIME LIMIT ON CERTAIN DEFENSES: (a) After three years
4 from the date of issue of this policy no misstatements, except fraudulent
5 misstatements, made by the applicant in the application for such policy, shall
6 be used to void the policy or to deny a claim for loss incurred or disability (as
7 defined in the policy) commencing after the expiration of such three-year
8 period.
9 (The foregoing policy provision shall not be so construed as to affect any
10 legal requirement for avoidance of a policy or denial of a claim during such
11 initial three-year period, nor to limit the application of subdivisions 4030(1)–
12 (5) of this title in the event of misstatement with respect to age or occupation
13 or other insurance.) (A policy which the insured has the right to continue in
14 force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premium (1) until at least
15 age 50, or (2) in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years
16 from its date of issue, may contain in lieu of the foregoing the following
17 provision (from which the clause in parentheses may be omitted at the
18 insurer’s option) under the caption “INCONTESTABLE”:
19 After this policy has been in force for a period of three years during the
20 lifetime of the insured (excluding any period during which the insured is
VT LEG #382889 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 28 of 181
1 disabled), it shall become incontestable as to the statements contained in the
2 application.)
3 (b) No claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy)
4 commencing after three years from the date of issue of this policy shall be
5 reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition not
6 excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective on the date
7 of loss had existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this policy.
8 (3) GRACE PERIOD: A grace period of . . . . (insert a number not less
9 than “7” for weekly premium policies, “10” for monthly premium policies and
10 “31” for all other policies) days will be granted for the payment of each
11 premium falling due after the first premium, during which grace period the
12 policy shall continue in force.
13 (A policy which contains a cancellation provision may add, at the end of
14 the above provision,
15 subject to the right of the insurer to cancel in accordance with the
16 cancellation provision hereof,
17 A policy in which the insurer reserves the right to refuse any renewal
18 shall have, at the beginning of the above provision,
19 Unless not less than five days prior to the premium due date the insurer has
20 delivered to the insured or has mailed to his or her last address as shown by the

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 29 of 181
1 records of the insurer written notice of its intention not to renew this policy
2 beyond the period for which the premium has been accepted.)
3 (4) REINSTATEMENT: If any renewal premium be not paid within the
4 time granted the insured for payment, a subsequent acceptance of premium by
5 the insurer or by any agent duly authorized by the insurer to accept such
6 premium, without requiring in connection therewith an application for
7 reinstatement, shall reinstate the policy; provided, however, that if the insurer
8 or such agent requires an application for reinstatement and issues a conditional
9 receipt for the premium tendered, the policy will be reinstated upon approval
10 of such application by the insurer or, lacking such approval, upon the 45th day
11 following the date of such conditional receipt unless the insurer has previously
12 notified the insured in writing of its disapproval of such application. The
13 reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from such accidental injury as
14 may be sustained after the date of reinstatement and loss due to such sickness
15 as may begin more than ten days after such date. In all other respects the
16 insured and insurer shall have the same rights thereunder as they had under the
17 policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to
18 any provisions endorsed hereon or attached hereto in connection with the
19 reinstatement. Any premium accepted in connection with a reinstatement shall
20 be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not
21 to any period more than sixty days prior to the date of reinstatement.

1 (The last sentence of the above provision may be omitted from any
2 policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms
3 by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50, or (2) in the case
4 of a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue.)
5 (5) NOTICE OF CLAIM: Written notice of claim must be given to the
6 insurer within 20 days after the occurrence or commencement of any loss
7 covered by the policy, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible. Notice
8 given by or on behalf of the insured or the beneficiary to the insurer at . . . .
9 (insert the location of such office as the insurer may designate for the purpose),
10 or to any authorized agent of the insurer, with information sufficient to identify
11 the insured, shall be deemed notice to the insurer.
12 (In a policy providing a loss-of-time benefit which may be payable for at
13 least two years, an insurer may at its option insert the following between the
14 first and second sentences of the above provision:
15 Subject to the qualifications set forth below, if the insured suffers loss of
16 time on account of disability for which indemnity may be payable for at least
17 two years, he or she shall, at least once in every six months after having given
18 notice of claim, give to the insurer notice of continuance of said disability,
19 except in the event of legal incapacity. The period of six months following any
20 filing of proof by the insured or any payment by the insurer on account of such
21 claim or any denial of liability in whole or in part by the insurer shall be

1 excluded in applying this provision. Delay in the giving of such notice shall
2 not impair the insured’s right to any indemnity which would otherwise have
3 accrued during the period of six months preceding the date on which such
4 notice is actually given.)
5 (6) CLAIM FORMS: The insurer, upon receipt of a notice of claim, will
6 furnish to the claimant such forms as are usually furnished by it for filing
7 proofs of loss. If such forms are not furnished within 15 days after the giving
8 of such notice the claimant shall be deemed to have complied with the
9 requirements of this policy as to proof of loss upon submitting, within the time
10 fixed in the policy for filing proofs of loss, written proof covering the
11 occurrence, the character and the extent of the loss for which claim is made.
12 (7) PROOFS OF LOSS: Written proof of loss must be furnished to the
13 insurer at its said office in case of claim for loss for which this policy provides
14 any periodic payment contingent upon continuing loss within 90 days after the
15 termination of the period for which the insurer is liable and in case of claim for
16 any other loss within 90 days after the date of such loss. Failure to furnish
17 such proof within the time required shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if
18 it was not reasonably possible to give proof within such time, provided such
19 proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the
20 absence of legal capacity, later than one year from the time proof is otherwise
21 required.

1 (8) TIME OF PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Indemnities payable under this
2 policy for any loss other than loss for which this policy provides any periodic
3 payment will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof of such
4 loss. Subject to due written proof of loss, all accrued indemnities for loss for
5 which this policy provides periodic payment will be paid . . . . (insert period for
6 payment which must not be less frequently than monthly) and any balance
7 remaining unpaid upon the termination of liability will be paid immediately
8 upon receipt of due written proof.
9 (9) PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Indemnity for loss of life will be payable in
10 accordance with the beneficiary designation and the provisions respecting such
11 payment which may be prescribed herein and effective at the time of payment.
12 If no such designation or provision is then effective, such indemnity shall be
13 payable to the estate of the insured. Any other accrued indemnities unpaid at
14 the insured’s death may, at the option of the insurer, be paid either to such
15 beneficiary or to such estate. All other indemnities will be payable to the
16 insured.
17 (The following provisions, or either of them, may be included with the
18 foregoing provision at the option of the insurer:
19 If any indemnity of this policy shall be payable to the estate of the insured,
20 or to an insured or beneficiary who is a minor or otherwise not competent to
21 give a valid release, the insurer may pay such indemnity, up to an amount not

1 exceeding $. . . . . . (insert an amount which shall not exceed $1,000.00), to any
2 relative by blood or connection by civil marriage of the insured or beneficiary
3 who is deemed by the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto. Any payment
4 made by the insurer in good faith pursuant to this provision shall fully
5 discharge the insurer to the extent of such payment.
6 Subject to any written direction of the insured in the application or
7 otherwise all or a portion of any indemnities provided by this policy on
8 account of hospital, nursing, medical, or surgical services may, at the insurer’s
9 option and unless the insured requests otherwise in writing not later than the
10 time of filing proofs of such loss, be paid directly to the hospital or person
11 rendering such services; but it is not required that the service be rendered by a
12 particular hospital or person.)
13 (10) PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS AND AUTOPSY: The insurer at its
14 own expense shall have the right and the opportunity to examine the person of
15 the insured when and as often as it may reasonably require during the
16 pendency of a claim hereunder and to make an autopsy in case of death where
17 it is not forbidden by law.
18 (11) LEGAL ACTIONS: No action at law or in equity shall be brought to
19 recover on this policy prior to the expiration of 60 days after written proof of
20 loss has been furnished in accordance with the requirements of this policy. No

1 such action shall be brought after the expiration of three years after the time
2 written proof of loss is required to be furnished.
3 (12) CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY: Unless the insured makes an
4 irrevocable designation of beneficiary, the right to change of beneficiary is
5 reserved to the insured and the consent of the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall
6 not be requisite to surrender or assignment of this policy or to any change of
7 beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to any other changes in this policy.

9 of beneficiary, may be omitted at the insurer’s option.)
10 § 4030. OPTIONAL STANDARD POLICY PROVISIONS
11 Except as provided in section 4031 of this title, no health insurance policy
12 delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State shall contain
13 provisions respecting the matters set forth in this section unless the provisions
14 use the language set forth in this section; provided, however, that a health
15 insurer may, at its option, substitute different language approved by the
16 Commissioner for one or more provisions, provided the substituted language is
17 not less favorable in any respect to the insured or covered individual than the
18 language used in this section. Any provision set forth in this section that is
19 contained in the policy shall be preceded individually by the appropriate
20 caption appearing in this section or, at the option of the health insurer, by such
21 appropriate captions or subcaptions as the Commissioner may approve:
VT LEG #382889 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 35 of 181
1 (1) CHANGE OF OCCUPATION: If the insured be injured or contract
2 sickness after having changed his or her occupation to one classified by the
3 insurer as more hazardous than that stated in this policy or while doing for
4 compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so classified, the insurer
5 will pay only such portion of the indemnities provided in this policy as the
6 premium paid would have purchased at the rates and within the limits fixed by
7 the insurer for such more hazardous occupation. If the insured changes his or
8 her occupation to one classified by the insurer as less hazardous than that
9 stated in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of such change of
10 occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly, and will return the
11 excess pro rata unearned premium from the date of change of occupation or
12 from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of such proof,
13 whichever is the more recent. In applying this provision, the classification of
14 occupational risk and the premium rates shall be such as have been last filed by
15 the insurer prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable or
16 prior to date of proof of change in occupation with the state official having
17 supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided at the time this
18 policy was issued; but if such filing was not required, then the classification of
19 occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by
20 the insurer in such state prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the date
21 of proof of change in occupation.

1 (2) MISSTATEMENT OF AGE: If the age of the insured has been
2 misstated, all amounts payable under this policy shall be such as the premium
3 paid would have purchased at the correct age.
4 (3) OTHER INSURANCE IN THIS INSURER: If an accident or
5 sickness or accident and sickness policy or policies previously issued by the
6 insurer to the insured be in force concurrently herewith, making the aggregate
7 indemnity for .... (insert type of coverage or coverages) in excess of $
8 .................... (insert maximum limit of indemnity or indemnities) the excess
9 insurance shall be void and all premiums paid for such excess shall be returned
10 to the insured or to his or her estate.
11 or, in lieu thereof:
12 Insurance effective at any one time on the insured under a like policy or
13 policies in this insurer is limited to the one such policy elected by the insured,
14 his or her beneficiary or his or her estate, as the case may be, and the insurer
15 will return all premiums paid for all other such policies.
16 (4) INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS: If there be other valid
17 coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a
18 provision of service basis or on an expense incurred basis and of which this
19 insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or
20 commencement of loss, the only liability under any expense incurred coverage
21 of this policy shall be for such proportion of the loss as the amount which
VT LEG #382889 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 37 of 181
1 would otherwise have been payable hereunder plus the total of the like
2 amounts under all such other valid coverages for the same loss of which this
3 insurer had notice bears to the total like amounts under all valid coverages for
4 such loss, and for the return of such portion of the premiums paid as shall
5 exceed the pro rata portion for the amount so determined. For the purpose of
6 applying this provision when other coverage is on a provision of service basis,
7 the “like amount” of such other coverage shall be taken as the amount which
8 the services rendered would have cost in the absence of such coverage.
9 (If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also
10 contains the next following policy provision there shall be added to the caption
11 of the foregoing provision the phrase “—EXPENSE INCURRED
12 BENEFITS.” The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a
13 definition of “other valid coverage,” approved as to form by the
14 Commissioner, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage
15 provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by
16 insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any
17 province of Canada, and by hospital or medical service organizations, and to
18 any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the
19 Commissioner. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include
20 group insurance, automobile medical payments insurance, or coverage
21 provided by hospital or medical service organizations or by union welfare

1 plans or employer or employee benefit organizations. For the purpose of
2 applying the foregoing policy provision with respect to any insured, any
3 amount of benefit provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory
4 benefit statute (including any workers’ compensation or employer’s liability
5 statute) whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise shall in all
6 cases be deemed to be “other valid coverage” of which the insurer has had
7 notice. In applying the foregoing policy provision no third party liability
8 coverage shall be included as “other valid coverage.”)
9 (5) INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS: If there be other valid
10 coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on other
11 than an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given
12 written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only
13 liability for such benefits under this policy shall be for such proportion of the
14 indemnities otherwise provided hereunder for such loss as the like indemnities
15 of which the insurer had notice (including the indemnities under this policy)
16 bear to the total amount of all like indemnities for such loss, and for the return
17 of such portion of the premium paid as shall exceed the pro rata portion for the
18 indemnities thus determined.
19 (If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also
20 contains the next preceding policy provision there shall be added to the caption
21 of the foregoing provision the phrase “—OTHER BENEFITS.” The insurer

1 may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “other valid
2 coverage,” approved as to form by the Commissioner, which definition shall be
3 limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to
4 regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other
5 state of the United States or any province of Canada, and to any other coverage
6 the inclusion of which may be approved by the Commissioner. In the absence
7 of such definition such term shall not include group insurance, or benefits
8 provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit
9 organizations. For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy provision with
10 respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such insured
11 pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers’
12 compensation or employer’s liability statute) whether provided by a
13 governmental agency or otherwise shall in all cases be deemed to be “other
14 valid coverage” of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing
15 policy provision no third party liability coverage shall be included as “other
16 valid coverage.”)
17 (6) RELATION OF EARNINGS TO INSURANCE: If the total monthly
18 amount of loss of time benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss
19 of time coverage upon the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly
20 basis, shall exceed the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability
21 commenced or his or her average monthly earnings for the period of two years

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 40 of 181
1 immediately preceding a disability for which claim is made, whichever is the
2 greater, the insurer will be liable only for such proportionate amount of such
3 benefits under this policy as the amount of such monthly earnings or such
4 average monthly earnings of the insured bears to the total amount of monthly
5 benefits for the same loss under all such coverage upon the insured at the time
6 such disability commences and for the return of such part of the premiums paid
7 during such two years as shall exceed the pro rata amount of the premiums for
8 the benefits actually paid hereunder; but this shall not operate to reduce the
9 total monthly amount of benefits payable under all such coverage upon the
10 insured below the sum of $200.00 or the sum of the monthly benefits specified
11 in such coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to reduce
12 benefits other than those payable for loss of time.
13 (The foregoing policy provision may be inserted only in a policy which
14 the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely
15 payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50; or (2) in the case of a policy
16 issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue. The insurer
17 may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “valid loss of time
18 coverage,” approved as to form by the Commissioner, which definition shall be
19 limited in subject matter to coverage provided by governmental agencies or by
20 organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities
21 of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, or to

1 any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the
2 Commissioner or any combination of such coverages. In the absence of such
3 definition such term shall not include any coverage provided for such insured
4 pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers’
5 compensation or employer’s liability statute), or benefits provided by union
6 welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations.)
7 (7) UNPAID PREMIUM: Upon the payment of a claim under this policy,
8 any premium then due and unpaid or covered by any note or written order may
9 be deducted therefrom.
10 (8) CANCELLATION: The insurer may cancel this policy at any time by
11 written notice delivered to the insured, or mailed to his or her last address as
12 shown by the records of the insurer, stating when, not less than five days
13 thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective; and after the policy has been
14 continued beyond its original term the insured may cancel this policy at any
15 time by written notice delivered or mailed to the insurer, effective upon receipt
16 or on such later date as may be specified in such notice. In the event of
17 cancellation, the insurer will return promptly the unearned portion of any
18 premium paid. If the insured cancels, the earned premium shall be computed
19 by the use of the short-rate table last filed with the state official having
20 supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided when the policy
21 was issued. If the insurer cancels, the earned premium shall be computed pro
VT LEG #382889 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 42 of 181
1 rata. Cancellation shall be without prejudice to any claim originating prior to
2 the effective date of cancellation.
3 (9) CONFORMITY WITH STATE STATUTES: Any provision of this
4 policy which, on its effective date, is in conflict with the statutes of the state in
5 which the insured resides on such date is hereby amended to conform to the
6 minimum requirements of such statutes.
7 (10) ILLEGAL OCCUPATION: The insurer shall not be liable for any
8 loss to which a contributing cause was the insured’s commission of or attempt
9 to commit a felony or to which a contributing cause was the insured’s being
10 engaged in an illegal occupation.
11 § 4031. OMISSION OF INAPPLICABLE OR INCONSISTENT
12 STANDARD PROVISIONS
13 If any provision of sections 4029 and 4030 of this title is in whole or in part
14 inapplicable to or inconsistent with the coverage provided by a particular form
15 of policy, the health insurer, with the approval of the Commissioner, shall omit
16 from such policy any inapplicable provision or part of a provision, and shall
17 modify any inconsistent provision or part of the provision in such manner as to
18 make the provision as contained in the policy consistent with the coverage

1 § 4032. ORDER OF STANDARD POLICY PROVISIONS
2 The provisions specified in sections 4029 and 4030 of this title, or any
3 corresponding provisions used in lieu of those provisions as permitted by those
4 sections, shall either be printed in the same order as the provisions are set forth
5 in those sections or, at the option of the health insurer, any such provision may
6 appear as a unit in any part of the policy, with other provisions to which it may
7 be logically related, provided the resulting policy shall not be in whole or in
8 part unintelligible, uncertain, ambiguous, abstruse, or likely to mislead a
9 person to whom the policy is offered, delivered, or issued.
10 § 4033. DISCRETIONARY CLAUSES PROHIBITED
11 (a) The purpose of this section is to ensure that health insurance benefits,
12 disability income protection coverage, and life insurance benefits are
13 contractually guaranteed and to avoid the conflict of interest that may occur
14 when the carrier responsible for providing benefits has discretionary authority
15 to decide what benefits are due. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
16 impose any requirement or duty on any person other than a health insurer or a
17 health insurer offering disability income protection coverage or life insurance.
18 (b) As used in this section:

1 payments for a specified period during the continuance of disability resulting
2 from illness, injury, or a combination of illness and injury.
3 (2) “Health insurer” has the same meaning as in section 4021 of this
4 chapter and, as used in this section, also includes entities offering policies for
5 specific disease, accident, injury, hospital indemnity, dental care, disability
6 income, long-term care, and other limited benefit coverage.
7 (3) “Life insurance” means a policy, contract, certificate, or agreement
8 that provides life insurance as defined in subdivision 3301(a)(1) of this title.
9 (c) No policy, contract, certificate, or agreement offered or issued in this
10 State by a health insurer to provide, deliver, arrange for, pay for, or reimburse
11 any of the costs of health care services may contain a provision purporting to
12 reserve discretion to the health insurer to interpret the terms of the contract or
13 to provide standards of interpretation or review that are inconsistent with the
14 laws of this State, and any such provision in a policy, contract, certificate, or
15 agreement shall be null and void.
16 (d) No policy, contract, certificate, or agreement offered or issued in this
17 State providing for disability income protection coverage may contain a
18 provision purporting to reserve discretion to the insurer to interpret the terms
19 of the contract or to provide standards of interpretation or review that are
20 inconsistent with the laws of this State, and any such provision in a policy,
21 contract, certificate, or agreement shall be null and void.

6 and void.

8 (a) Any policy of a foreign or alien insurer, when delivered or issued for
9 delivery to any person in this State, may contain any provision that is not less
10 favorable to the covered individual than the provisions of this chapter and that
11 is prescribed or required by the law of the state under which the insurer is
12 organized.
13 (b) Any policy of a domestic health insurer, when issued for delivery in any
14 other state or country, may contain any provision permitted or required by the
15 laws of such other state or country.
16 § 4035. POLICIES NOT AFFECTED
17 Nothing in sections 4018–4020, 4023, 4028–4032, 4034, 4036, and 4037 of
18 this title shall apply to or affect:
19 (1) any policy of workers’ compensation insurance or any policy of

6 supplemental to those contracts, that contain only such provisions relating to
7 accident and sickness insurance as:
8 (A) provide additional benefits in case of death or dismemberment or
9 loss of sight by accident; or
10 (B) operate to safeguard the contracts against lapse or to give a
11 special surrender value or special benefit or an annuity in the event that the
12 insured or annuitant becomes totally and permanently disabled, as defined by
13 the contract or supplemental contract.
14 § 4036. NONCONFORMING POLICIES
15 (a) A health insurance policy shall not contain any provision that makes the
16 policy or any portion of the policy less favorable in any respect to the covered
17 individual than the provisions of the policy that are regulated by sections 4029
18 and 4030 of this title.
19 (b) A policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State in
20 violation of sections 4029 and 4030 of this title shall be held valid but shall be
21 construed as provided in this chapter. When any provision in a policy
VT LEG #382889 v.1

2025 Page 47 of 181
1 regulated by sections 4029 and 4030 is in conflict with any provision of those
2 sections, the rights, duties, and obligations of the health insurer and the
3 covered individual shall be governed by the provisions of those sections.
4 § 4037. APPLICATIONS FOR INSURANCE
5 (a)(1) A covered individual shall not be bound by any statement made in an
6 application for a policy unless a copy of the application is attached to or
7 endorsed on the policy as a part of the policy when issued.

9 is reinstated or renewed and the covered individual or assignee of the policy
10 makes a written request to the health insurer for a copy of the application, if
11 any, for such reinstatement or renewal, the health insurer shall deliver or mail a
12 copy of the application to the individual making the request within 15 days
13 after the receipt of the request. If the health insurer does not deliver or mail the
14 copy within 15 days, the health insurer shall be precluded from introducing the
15 application as evidence in any action or proceeding based on or involving the
16 policy or its reinstatement or renewal.
17 (b) No alteration of a written application for a policy shall be made by any
18 person other than the applicant without the applicant’s written consent, except
19 that insertions may be made by the health insurer, for administrative purposes
20 only, in a manner that indicates clearly that the insertions are not to be ascribed
21 to the applicant.

1 (c) The falsity of any statement in an application for a policy shall not bar
2 the right to recovery under the policy unless the false statement materially
3 affected either the acceptance of the risk or the hazard assumed by the health
4 insurer.
5 § 4038. RULEMAKING ON POLICY FILINGS
6 The Commissioner may adopt such reasonable rules concerning the
7 procedure for the filing or submission of policies subject to sections 4023 and
8 4028–4030 of this title as are necessary, proper, or advisable for the
9 administration of these sections. This provision shall not abridge any other

2 (b) Premium increases.
3 (1) Within five days after receiving a request for approval of any
4 composite average rate increase in excess of three percent, or any other
5 coverage changes that the Commissioner determines will have a comparable
6 impact on cost or availability of coverage for a Medicare supplement insurance
7 policy issued by any health insurer with 5,000 or more total lives in the
8 Vermont Medicare supplement insurance market, the Commissioner shall

15 33 V.S.A. § 505 of the proposed premium increase.
16 (3)(A) The Commissioner shall not approve any request to increase
17 Medicare supplement insurance premium rates unless the amount of the rate
18 increase complies with the statutory standards for approval under sections
19 4026, 4513, 4584, and 5104 of this title. Any approved rate increase shall not
20 be based on an unreasonable change in loss ratio from the previous year, unless

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.30
2025 Page 70 of 181
1 prevent a substantial adverse impact on the financial condition of the health
2 insurer. In acting on such rate increase requests, the Commissioner may deny
3 the request, approve the rate increase as requested, or approve a rate increase in
4 an amount different from the increase requested. A decision by the
5 Commissioner other than an approval of the rate requested may be appealed by
6 the health insurer, provided that the burden of proof shall be on the health
7 insurer to show that the approved rate does not meet the statutory standards
8 established under this subsection.
9 (B) Before acting on the rate increase requested, the Commissioner
10 may make such examination or investigation as the Commissioner deems
11 necessary, including where applicable the review process set forth in
12 subdivision (C) of this subdivision (3).

16 the independent expert’s recommended composite average rate increase, or the
17 Department actuary’s recommended composite average rate increase differ by
18 two percentage points or more, the Commissioner shall hold a public hearing at
19 which the health insurer, the Department’s actuary, the independent expert, any
20 intervenor, and the public will have the opportunity to present written and oral
VT LEG #382889 v.1

2 those present.
3 (ii) The hearing shall be noticed and held at a time and place so as
4 to facilitate public participation, and shall be recorded and become part of the
5 record before the Commissioner. At the Commissioner’s discretion, the
6 hearing may be conducted remotely.
7 (iii) If the carrier’s requested composite average increase, the
8 independent expert’s recommended composite average increase, or the
9 Department actuary’s recommended composite average increase differs by less
10 than two percentage points, the Department and the parties shall confer by
11 conference call, or by any other available media, to review the rate requests
12 and recommendations. However, a public hearing may be held at the
13 Commissioner’s discretion for good cause shown.
14 (D)(i) In any review held in accordance with this subdivision (3), the
15 Commissioner shall permit intervention by any person whom the
16 Commissioner determines will materially advance the interests of the covered
17 individuals. The intervenor shall have access to and may use the information
18 of the independent expert appointed under 33 V.S.A. § 6706.
19 (ii) The reasonable and necessary cost of intervention as
20 determined by the Commissioner shall be paid by the affected policyholders or
21 certificate holders. The maximum payment shall be $2,500.00 except when

2 amount may be adjusted to reflect, at the Commissioner’s discretion,
3 appropriate inflation factors.
4 (E) Nonproprietary, relevant information in any Medicare
5 supplement insurance rate filing, including any analysis by the Department’s
6 actuary and the independent expert, shall be made available to the public upon
7 request.
8 (c) Disability.
9 (1) A health insurer that issues Medicare supplement insurance policies
10 or certificates to a person eligible for Medicare by reason of age shall make
11 available, to persons eligible for Medicare by reason of disability, the same
12 policies or certificates that are offered and sold to persons eligible for
13 Medicare by reason of age. The initial enrollment period for any such policies
14 or certificates shall be at least six months following the date the individual
15 becomes eligible for Medicare by reason of disability. Any additional
16 enrollment periods as required by law and offered to individuals eligible by
17 reason of age shall be offered to individuals eligible by reason of disability.

10 health care services or products, and that covers special groups of persons as
11 follows:

13 be deemed the policyholder, covering a group defined as all persons who may
14 become passengers on such common carrier;

16 deemed the policyholder, covering any group of employees defined by
17 reference to exceptional hazards incident to such employment;

19 school, or approved education program, as those terms are defined in
20 16 V.S.A. § 11; to a postsecondary school, as defined in 16 V.S.A.

2 provider, who or which shall be deemed the policyholder, covering students or
3 teachers, or both;
4 (4) under a policy or contract issued in the name of any volunteer fire
5 department, emergency medical services provider, or other such volunteer
6 group, which shall be deemed the policyholder, covering all of the members of
7 the department or group in connection with their department or group
8 activities; or
9 (5) under a policy or contract issued to any other substantially similar
10 group that, in the discretion of the Commissioner and after the prior approval
11 by the Commissioner of the group, may be subject to the issuance of a blanket
12 health policy or contract.
13 (b)(1) No blanket health insurance policy shall contain any provision
14 relating to notice of claim, proofs of loss, time of payment of claims, or time
15 within which legal action must be brought upon the policy that, in the opinion
16 of the Commissioner, is less favorable to the persons insured than would be
17 permitted by the provisions set forth in section 4029 of this title.
18 (2) An individual application shall not be required from a person
19 covered under a blanket health policy or contract, nor shall it be necessary for
20 the insurer to furnish each person a certificate.

1 (3) All benefits under any blanket health policy shall, unless for hospital
2 and physician service or surgical benefits, be payable to the person insured, or
3 to the person’s designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to the person’s
4 estate, except that if the person insured is a minor, the benefits may be made
5 payable to the minor’s parent, guardian, or other person actually supporting the
6 minor.
7 (4) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the legal liability of
8 policyholders for the death of, or injury to, any members of the group.
9 (c) No blanket health insurance policy that provides coverage for the
10 payment of all or a portion of the cost of health care services or products shall
11 contain any provision that does not comply with a requirement of this title, or a
12 rule adopted pursuant to this title applicable to health insurance, other than
13 those requirements applicable to nongroup health insurance or small group
14 health insurance. The Commissioner may waive the application to a blanket
15 insurance policy of one or more of the health insurance requirements of this
16 title, or a rule adopted pursuant to this title, if the requirement is not relevant to

18 policy.

5 coverage without a certificate of authority from the Commissioner to offer
6 health insurance in this State unless the person is exempted by subdivision
7 3368(a)(4) of this title.
8 (c) A short-term, limited-duration health insurance policy or contract shall
9 be nonrenewable, and a health insurer shall not issue a short-term, limited-
10 duration health insurance policy or contract to any person if the issuance would
11 result in the person being covered by short-term, limited-duration health
12 insurance coverage for more than three months in any 12-month period.
13 (d) A policy or contract for short-term, limited-duration health insurance
14 coverage shall display prominently in the policy or contract and in any

9 dependent children of covered individuals, the plan shall provide benefits to
10 dependent children placed with covered individuals for adoption under the
11 same terms and conditions as apply to the natural, dependent children of the
12 covered individuals, irrespective of whether the adoption has become final.
13 (3) A health insurance plan shall not restrict coverage under the plan of
14 any dependent child adopted by a covered individual, or placed with a covered
15 individual for adoption, solely on the basis of a preexisting condition of the

14 (B) became so incapable prior to attainment of the limiting age; and
15 (C) is chiefly dependent upon the employee, member, subscriber, or
16 policyholder for support and maintenance.
17 (2) Coverage under subdivision (1) of this subsection shall not be denied
18 any person based upon the existence of such a condition; provided, however,
19 that a health insurance plan may require reasonable periodic proof of a
20 continuing condition not more frequently than once every year.

17 or services provided by other primary care physicians, but may allow for the
18 management of the benefit consistent with variations in practice patterns and
19 treatment modalities among different types of health care professionals.

2 rules adopted by the Department of Financial Regulation, provided that the
3 amounts, limits, and review shall not function to direct treatment in a manner
4 unfairly discriminative against athletic trainer care, and collectively shall be
5 not more restrictive than those applicable under the same policy for care or
6 services provided by other health care professionals but allowing for the
7 management of the benefit consistent with variations in practice patterns and
8 treatment modalities among different types of health care professionals.
9 (c) A health insurer may require that the athletic trainer services be
