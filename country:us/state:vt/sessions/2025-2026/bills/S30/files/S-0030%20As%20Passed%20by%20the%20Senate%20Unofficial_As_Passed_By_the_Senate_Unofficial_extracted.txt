9 advertising copy or advertising practice or plan of solicitation shall be
10 considered to be materially misleading or deceptive if by implication or
11 otherwise it transmits information in such manner or of such substance that a
12 prospective applicant for health insurance may be misled by it to the
13 applicant’s material damage.
14 (b)(1) If the Commissioner finds that any such advertising copy or
15 advertising practice or plan of solicitation is materially misleading or
16 deceptive, the Commissioner shall order the company or the agent or broker
17 using such copy or practice or plan to cease and desist from such use.
18 (2) Before making any such finding and order, the Commissioner shall

3 § 4017. EXEMPTION FROM ATTACHMENT AND TRUSTEE PROCESS
4 So much of any benefits under all policies of health insurance as does not
5 exceed $200.00 for each month during any period of disability covered by the
6 policy shall not be liable to attachment, trustee process, or other process, or to
7 be seized, taken, appropriated, or applied by any legal or equitable process or
8 by operation of law, either before or after payment of such benefits, to pay any
9 debt or liabilities of the person insured under the policy. However, this
10 exemption shall not apply where an action is brought to recover for necessaries
11 contracted for during the period of disability and the writ or bill of complaint
12 contains a statement to that effect. When a policy provides for a lump sum
13 payment because of a dismemberment or other loss insured, the payment shall
14 be exempt from execution of the covered individual’s creditors.
15 § 4018. THIRD-PARTY OWNERSHIP
16 Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as preventing a person other than

20 policy.

4 acknowledgement of receipt of notice under the plan, furnishing or accepting
5 forms for filing proof of loss under the plan, or investigating any claim of loss
6 under the plan.
7 § 4020. AGE LIMITS
8 (a) If a health insurance plan contains a provision establishing, as an age
9 limit or otherwise, a date after which the coverage provided by the plan will
10 not be effective, and if that date falls within a period for which the health
11 insurer has accepted a premium or if the health insurer accepts a premium after
12 that date, the coverage provided by the plan shall continue in force subject to
13 any right of cancellation until the end of the period for which a premium has
14 been accepted.
15 (b) Notwithstanding any provision of subsection (a) of this section to the
16 contrary, if the age of the covered individual has been misstated and if,
17 according to the correct age of the covered individual, the coverage provided
18 by the policy would not have become effective or would have ceased prior to
19 the health insurer’s acceptance of the premium or premiums, then the health
20 insurer’s liability shall be limited to the refund, upon request, of all premiums
21 paid for the period not covered by the plan.

4 (A) call as witnesses the Commissioner of Financial Regulation or
5 designee and the Board’s contracting actuary, if any, unless all parties agree to
6 waive such testimony; and
7 (B) provide an opportunity for testimony from the insurer, the Office
8 of the Health Care Advocate, and members of the public;
9 (2) at a public hearing, announce the Board’s decision of whether to

14 (2) Rates shall take effect on the date specified in the insurer’s rate
15 filing.

1 appeal a decision of the Board approving, modifying, or disapproving the
2 insurer’s proposed rate to the Vermont Supreme Court.
3 (h)(1) The authority of the Board under this section shall apply only to the
4 rate review process for policies for major medical insurance coverage and shall
5 not apply to the policy forms for major medical insurance coverage or to the
6 rate and policy form review process for policies for specific disease, accident,
7 injury, hospital indemnity, dental care, vision care, disability income, long-
8 term care, student health insurance coverage, Medicare supplement insurance
9 coverage, or other limited benefit coverage; to short-term, limited-duration
10 health insurance coverage; or to benefit plans that are paid directly to an
11 individual insured or to the individual’s assigns and for which the amount of
12 the benefit is not based on potential medical costs or actual costs incurred.
13 Premium rates and rules for the classification of risk for Medicare supplement

15 (2) The policy forms for major medical insurance coverage, as well as
16 the policy forms, premium rates, and rules for the classification of risk for the
17 other lines of insurance described in subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be

2025 Page 23 of 180
1 major medical insurance coverage, whether it ensures equal access to
2 appropriate mental health care in a manner equivalent to other aspects of health
3 care as part of an integrated, holistic system of care. The Commissioner shall
4 make a determination within 30 days after the date the insurer filed the policy
5 form, premium rate, or rule with the Department. At the expiration of the 30-
6 day period, the form, premium rate, or rule shall be deemed approved unless
7 prior to then it has been affirmatively approved or disapproved by the
8 Commissioner or found to be incomplete. The Commissioner shall notify a
9 health insurer in writing if the insurer files any form, premium rate, or rule
10 containing a provision that does not meet the standards expressed in this
11 subsection. In such notice, the Commissioner shall state that a hearing will be
12 granted within 20 days upon the insurer’s written request.
13 (i) Notwithstanding the procedures and timelines set forth in subsections
14 (a) through (e) of this section, the Board may establish, by rule, a streamlined
15 rate review process for certain rate decisions, including proposed rates
16 affecting fewer than a minimum number of covered lives and proposed rates
17 for which a de minimis increase, as defined by the Board by rule, is sought.

7 (1) The policy sets forth all of the monetary and other considerations for
8 the policy.
9 (2) The policy sets forth the time at which the insurance takes effect and
10 terminates.
11 (3) The policy purports to insure only one person, except that a policy
12 may insure, originally or by subsequent amendment, upon the application of an
13 adult member of a family who shall be deemed the policyholder, any two or
14 more eligible members of that family, including a spouse or civil union
15 partner, dependent children or any children under a specified age that shall not
16 exceed 26 years of age, and any other person dependent upon the policyholder.
17 (4) The style, arrangement, and overall appearance of the policy give no
18 undue prominence to any portion of the text, and every printed portion of the

8 “EXCEPTIONS AND REDUCTIONS”; provided, however, that if an
9 exception or reduction specifically applies only to a particular benefit of the
10 policy, the statement of the exception or reduction shall be included with the
11 benefit provision to which it applies.
12 (6) Each policy form, including riders and endorsements, is identified by
13 a form number in the lower left-hand corner of the first page of the form.
14 (7) The policy does not contain any provision purporting to make any
15 portion of the charter, rules, constitution, or bylaws of the health insurer a part
16 of the policy unless that portion is set forth in full in the policy, except in the
17 case of the incorporation of, or reference to, a statement of rates or
18 classification of risks or a short-rate table filed with the Commissioner.
19 (8) Either prominently printed on or attached to the first page of the
20 policy is a notice to the effect that during a period of 30 days following the
21 date the policy is delivered to persons eligible for Medicare by reason of age,

1 and 10 days following the date of delivery to all other persons, the policy may
2 be surrendered to the insurer together with a written request for cancellation of
3 the policy, and that in such event, the insurer will refund any premium paid,

5 subdivision shall not apply to single premium nonrenewable policies insuring
6 against accident only or medical costs or accidental bodily injury only.

10 provisions specified in this section using the language set forth in this section;
11 provided, however, that a health insurer may, at its option, substitute different
12 language approved by the Commissioner for one or more provisions, provided
13 the substituted language is not less favorable in any respect to the insured or
14 covered individual than the language used in this section. The provisions
15 specified in this section shall be preceded individually by the caption appearing
16 in this section or, at the option of the health insurer, by such appropriate
17 captions or subcaptions as the Commissioner may approve:
18 (1) ENTIRE CONTRACT; CHANGES: This policy, including the
19 endorsements and the attached papers, if any, constitutes the entire contract of
20 insurance. No change in this policy shall be valid until approved by an
21 executive officer of the insurer and unless such approval be endorsed hereon or
VT LEG #380954 v.1
AS PASSED BY SENATE S.30
2025 Page 27 of 180
1 attached hereto. No agent has authority to change this policy or to waive any
2 of its provisions.
3 (2) TIME LIMIT ON CERTAIN DEFENSES: (a) After three years
4 from the date of issue of this policy no misstatements, except fraudulent
5 misstatements, made by the applicant in the application for such policy, shall
6 be used to void the policy or to deny a claim for loss incurred or disability (as
7 defined in the policy) commencing after the expiration of such three year
8 period.
9 After this policy has been in force for a period of three years during the
10 lifetime of the insured (excluding any period during which the insured is
11 disabled), it shall become incontestable as to the statements contained in the
12 application.)
13 (b) No claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy)
14 commencing after three years from the date of issue of this policy shall be
15 reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition not
16 excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective on the date
17 of loss had existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this policy.
18 (3) GRACE PERIOD: A grace period of . . . . (insert a number not less
19 than “7” for weekly premium policies, “10” for monthly premium policies and
20 “31” for all other policies) days will be granted for the payment of each
VT LEG #380954 v.1
AS PASSED BY SENATE S.30
2025 Page 28 of 180
1 premium falling due after the first premium, during which grace period the
2 policy shall continue in force.
3 (A policy which contains a cancellation provision may add, at the end of
4 the above provision,
5 subject to the right of the insurer to cancel in accordance with the
6 cancellation provision hereof,
7 A policy in which the insurer reserves the right to refuse any renewal
8 shall have, at the beginning of the above provision,
9 Unless not less than five days prior to the premium due date the insurer has
10 delivered to the insured or has mailed to his or her last address as shown by the
11 records of the insurer written notice of its intention not to renew this policy
12 beyond the period for which the premium has been accepted.)
13 (4) REINSTATEMENT: If any renewal premium be not paid within the
14 time granted the insured for payment, a subsequent acceptance of premium by
15 the insurer or by any agent duly authorized by the insurer to accept such
16 premium, without requiring in connection therewith an application for
17 reinstatement, shall reinstate the policy; provided, however, that if the insurer
18 or such agent requires an application for reinstatement and issues a conditional
19 receipt for the premium tendered, the policy will be reinstated upon approval
20 of such application by the insurer or, lacking such approval, upon the 45th day
21 following the date of such conditional receipt unless the insurer has previously
VT LEG #380954 v.1
AS PASSED BY SENATE S.30
2025 Page 29 of 180
1 notified the insured in writing of its disapproval of such application. The
2 reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from such accidental injury as
3 may be sustained after the date of reinstatement and loss due to such sickness
4 as may begin more than ten days after such date. In all other respects the
5 insured and insurer shall have the same rights thereunder as they had under the
6 policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to
7 any provisions endorsed hereon or attached hereto in connection with the
8 reinstatement. Any premium accepted in connection with a reinstatement shall
9 be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not
10 to any period more than sixty days prior to the date of reinstatement.
11 (The last sentence of the above provision may be omitted from any
12 policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms
13 by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50, or (2) in the case
14 of a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue.)
15 (5) NOTICE OF CLAIM: Written notice of claim must be given to the
16 insurer within 20 days after the occurrence or commencement of any loss
17 covered by the policy, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible. Notice
18 given by or on behalf of the insured or the beneficiary to the insurer at . . . .
19 (insert the location of such office as the insurer may designate for the purpose),
20 or to any authorized agent of the insurer, with information sufficient to identify
21 the insured, shall be deemed notice to the insurer.

AS PASSED BY SENATE S.30

1 (In a policy providing a loss-of-time benefit which may be payable for at
2 least two years, an insurer may at its option insert the following between the
3 first and second sentences of the above provision:
4 Subject to the qualifications set forth below, if the insured suffers loss of
5 time on account of disability for which indemnity may be payable for at least
6 two years, he or she shall, at least once in every six months after having given
7 notice of claim, give to the insurer notice of continuance of said disability,
8 except in the event of legal incapacity. The period of six months following any
9 filing of proof by the insured or any payment by the insurer on account of such
10 claim or any denial of liability in whole or in part by the insurer shall be
11 excluded in applying this provision. Delay in the giving of such notice shall
12 not impair the insured’s right to any indemnity which would otherwise have
13 accrued during the period of six months preceding the date on which such
14 notice is actually given.)
15 (6) CLAIM FORMS: The insurer, upon receipt of a notice of claim, will
16 furnish to the claimant such forms as are usually furnished by it for filing
17 proofs of loss. If such forms are not furnished within 15 days after the giving
18 of such notice the claimant shall be deemed to have complied with the
19 requirements of this policy as to proof of loss upon submitting, within the time
20 fixed in the policy for filing proofs of loss, written proof covering the
21 occurrence, the character and the extent of the loss for which claim is made.

1 (7) PROOFS OF LOSS: Written proof of loss must be furnished to the
2 insurer at its said office in case of claim for loss for which this policy provides
3 any periodic payment contingent upon continuing loss within 90 days after the
4 termination of the period for which the insurer is liable and in case of claim for
5 any other loss within 90 days after the date of such loss. Failure to furnish
6 such proof within the time required shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if
7 it was not reasonably possible to give proof within such time, provided such
8 proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the
9 absence of legal capacity, later than one year from the time proof is otherwise
10 required.
11 (8) TIME OF PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Indemnities payable under this
12 policy for any loss other than loss for which this policy provides any periodic
13 payment will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof of such
14 loss. Subject to due written proof of loss, all accrued indemnities for loss for
15 which this policy provides periodic payment will be paid . . . . (insert period for
16 payment which must not be less frequently than monthly) and any balance
17 remaining unpaid upon the termination of liability will be paid immediately
18 upon receipt of due written proof.
19 (9) PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Indemnity for loss of life will be payable in
20 accordance with the beneficiary designation and the provisions respecting such
21 payment which may be prescribed herein and effective at the time of payment.

1 If no such designation or provision is then effective, such indemnity shall be
2 payable to the estate of the insured. Any other accrued indemnities unpaid at
3 the insured’s death may, at the option of the insurer, be paid either to such
4 beneficiary or to such estate. All other indemnities will be payable to the
5 insured.
6 (The following provisions, or either of them, may be included with the
7 foregoing provision at the option of the insurer:
8 If any indemnity of this policy shall be payable to the estate of the insured,
9 or to an insured or beneficiary who is a minor or otherwise not competent to
10 give a valid release, the insurer may pay such indemnity, up to an amount not
11 exceeding $. . . . . . (insert an amount which shall not exceed $1,000.00), to any
12 relative by blood or connection by civil marriage of the insured or beneficiary
13 who is deemed by the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto. Any payment
14 made by the insurer in good faith pursuant to this provision shall fully
15 discharge the insurer to the extent of such payment.
16 Subject to any written direction of the insured in the application or
17 otherwise all or a portion of any indemnities provided by this policy on
18 account of hospital, nursing, medical, or surgical services may, at the insurer’s
19 option and unless the insured requests otherwise in writing not later than the
20 time of filing proofs of such loss, be paid directly to the hospital or person

1 rendering such services; but it is not required that the service be rendered by a
2 particular hospital or person.)
3 (10) PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS AND AUTOPSY: The insurer at its
4 own expense shall have the right and the opportunity to examine the person of
5 the insured when and as often as it may reasonably require during the
6 pendency of a claim hereunder and to make an autopsy in case of death where
7 it is not forbidden by law.
8 (11) LEGAL ACTIONS: No action at law or in equity shall be brought to
9 recover on this policy prior to the expiration of 60 days after written proof of
10 loss has been furnished in accordance with the requirements of this policy. No
11 such action shall be brought after the expiration of three years after the time
12 written proof of loss is required to be furnished.
13 (12) CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY: Unless the insured makes an
14 irrevocable designation of beneficiary, the right to change of beneficiary is
15 reserved to the insured and the consent of the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall
16 not be requisite to surrender or assignment of this policy or to any change of
17 beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to any other changes in this policy.

19 of beneficiary, may be omitted at the insurer’s option.)

1 § 4030. OPTIONAL STANDARD POLICY PROVISIONS
2 Except as provided in section 4031 of this title, no health insurance policy
3 delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State shall contain
4 provisions respecting the matters set forth in this section unless the provisions
5 use the language set forth in this section; provided, however, that a health
6 insurer may, at its option, substitute different language approved by the
7 Commissioner for one or more provisions, provided the substituted language is
8 not less favorable in any respect to the insured or covered individual than the
9 language used in this section. Any provision set forth in this section that is
10 contained in the policy shall be preceded individually by the appropriate
11 caption appearing in this section or, at the option of the health insurer, by such
12 appropriate captions or subcaptions as the Commissioner may approve:
13 (1) CHANGE OF OCCUPATION: If the insured be injured or contract
14 sickness after having changed his or her occupation to one classified by the
15 insurer as more hazardous than that stated in this policy or while doing for
16 compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so classified, the insurer
17 will pay only such portion of the indemnities provided in this policy as the
18 premium paid would have purchased at the rates and within the limits fixed by
19 the insurer for such more hazardous occupation. If the insured changes his or
20 her occupation to one classified by the insurer as less hazardous than that
21 stated in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of such change of
VT LEG #380954 v.1
AS PASSED BY SENATE S.30
2025 Page 35 of 180
1 occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly, and will return the
2 excess pro rata unearned premium from the date of change of occupation or
3 from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of such proof,
4 whichever is the more recent. In applying this provision, the classification of
5 occupational risk and the premium rates shall be such as have been last filed by
6 the insurer prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable or
7 prior to date of proof of change in occupation with the state official having
8 supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided at the time this
9 policy was issued; but if such filing was not required, then the classification of
10 occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by
11 the insurer in such state prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the date
12 of proof of change in occupation.
13 (2) MISSTATEMENT OF AGE: If the age of the insured has been
14 misstated, all amounts payable under this policy shall be such as the premium
15 paid would have purchased at the correct age.
16 (3) OTHER INSURANCE IN THIS INSURER: If an accident or
17 sickness or accident and sickness policy or policies previously issued by the
18 insurer to the insured be in force concurrently herewith, making the aggregate
19 indemnity for .... (insert type of coverage or coverages) in excess of
20 $ .................... (insert maximum limit of indemnity or indemnities) the excess

AS PASSED BY SENATE S.30

1 insurance shall be void and all premiums paid for such excess shall be returned
2 to the insured or to his or her estate.
3 Insurance effective at any one time on the insured under a like policy or
4 policies in this insurer is limited to the one such policy elected by the insured,
5 his or her beneficiary or his or her estate, as the case may be, and the insurer
6 will return all premiums paid for all other such policies.
7 (4) INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS: If there be other valid
8 coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a
9 provision of service basis or on an expense incurred basis and of which this
10 insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or
11 commencement of loss, the only liability under any expense incurred coverage
12 of this policy shall be for such proportion of the loss as the amount which
13 would otherwise have been payable hereunder plus the total of the like
14 amounts under all such other valid coverages for the same loss of which this
15 insurer had notice bears to the total like amounts under all valid coverages for
16 such loss, and for the return of such portion of the premiums paid as shall
17 exceed the pro rata portion for the amount so determined. For the purpose of
18 applying this provision when other coverage is on a provision of service basis,
19 the “like amount” of such other coverage shall be taken as the amount which
20 the services rendered would have cost in the absence of such coverage.

5 definition of “other valid coverage,” approved as to form by the
6 Commissioner, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage
7 provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by
8 insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any

17 benefit statute (including any workers’ compensation or employer’s liability
18 statute) whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise shall in all
19 cases be deemed to be “other valid coverage” of which the insurer has had

3 than an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given
4 written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only
5 liability for such benefits under this policy shall be for such proportion of the
6 indemnities otherwise provided hereunder for such loss as the like indemnities
7 of which the insurer had notice (including the indemnities under this policy)
8 bear to the total amount of all like indemnities for such loss, and for the return
9 of such portion of the premium paid as shall exceed the pro rata portion for the
10 indemnities thus determined.

18 state of the United States or any province of Canada, and to any other coverage
19 the inclusion of which may be approved by the Commissioner. In the absence

4 compensation or employer’s liability statute) whether provided by a
5 governmental agency or otherwise shall in all cases be deemed to be “other
6 valid coverage” of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing
7 policy provision no third party liability coverage shall be included as “other
8 valid coverage.”)
9 (6) RELATION OF EARNINGS TO INSURANCE: If the total monthly
10 amount of loss of time benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss
11 of time coverage upon the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly
12 basis, shall exceed the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability
13 commenced or his or her average monthly earnings for the period of two years
14 immediately preceding a disability for which claim is made, whichever is the
15 greater, the insurer will be liable only for such proportionate amount of such
16 benefits under this policy as the amount of such monthly earnings or such
17 average monthly earnings of the insured bears to the total amount of monthly
18 benefits for the same loss under all such coverage upon the insured at the time
19 such disability commences and for the return of such part of the premiums paid
20 during such two years as shall exceed the pro rata amount of the premiums for
21 the benefits actually paid hereunder; but this shall not operate to reduce the

AS PASSED BY SENATE S.30

1 total monthly amount of benefits payable under all such coverage upon the
2 insured below the sum of $200.00 or the sum of the monthly benefits specified
3 in such coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to reduce
4 benefits other than those payable for loss of time.
5 (The foregoing policy provision may be inserted only in a policy which
6 the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely
7 payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50; or (2) in the case of a policy
8 issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue. The insurer
9 may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “valid loss of time
10 coverage,” approved as to form by the Commissioner, which definition shall be
11 limited in subject matter to coverage provided by governmental agencies or by
12 organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities
13 of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, or to
14 any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the
15 Commissioner or any combination of such coverages. In the absence of such
16 definition such term shall not include any coverage provided for such insured
17 pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers’
18 compensation or employer’s liability statute), or benefits provided by union
19 welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations.)

3 be deducted therefrom.
4 (8) CANCELLATION: The insurer may cancel this policy at any time by
5 written notice delivered to the insured, or mailed to his or her last address as
6 shown by the records of the insurer, stating when, not less than five days
7 thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective; and after the policy has been
8 continued beyond its original term the insured may cancel this policy at any
9 time by written notice delivered or mailed to the insurer, effective upon receipt
10 or on such later date as may be specified in such notice. In the event of
11 cancellation, the insurer will return promptly the unearned portion of any
12 premium paid. If the insured cancels, the earned premium shall be computed
13 by the use of the short-rate table last filed with the state official having
14 supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided when the policy
15 was issued. If the insurer cancels, the earned premium shall be computed pro
16 rata. Cancellation shall be without prejudice to any claim originating prior to
17 the effective date of cancellation.
18 (9) CONFORMITY WITH STATE STATUTES: Any provision of this
19 policy which, on its effective date, is in conflict with the statutes of the state in
20 which the insured resides on such date is hereby amended to conform to the

6 STANDARD PROVISIONS
7 If any provision of sections 4029 and 4030 of this title is in whole or in part
8 inapplicable to or inconsistent with the coverage provided by a particular form
9 of policy, the health insurer, with the approval of the Commissioner, shall omit
10 from such policy any inapplicable provision or part of a provision, and shall
11 modify any inconsistent provision or part of the provision in such manner as to

13 certificate, or agreement that provides for weekly, monthly, or other periodic
14 payments for a specified period during the continuance of disability resulting

16 (2) “Health insurer” has the same meaning as in section 4021 of this
17 chapter and, as used in this section, also includes entities offering policies for
18 specific disease, accident, injury, hospital indemnity, dental care, disability
19 income, long-term care, and other limited benefit coverage.
20 (3) “Life insurance” means a policy, contract, certificate, or agreement
21 that provides life insurance as defined in subdivision 3301(a)(1) of this title.

2 State by a health insurer to provide, deliver, arrange for, pay for, or reimburse
3 any of the costs of health care services may contain a provision purporting to
4 reserve discretion to the health insurer to interpret the terms of the contract or
5 to provide standards of interpretation or review that are inconsistent with the
6 laws of this State, and any such provision in a policy, contract, certificate, or
7 agreement shall be null and void.
8 (d) No policy, contract, certificate, or agreement offered or issued in this
9 State providing for disability income protection coverage may contain a
10 provision purporting to reserve discretion to the insurer to interpret the terms
11 of the contract or to provide standards of interpretation or review that are
12 inconsistent with the laws of this State, and any such provision in a policy,
13 contract, certificate, or agreement shall be null and void.
14 (e) No policy, contract, certificate, or agreement of life insurance offered or
15 issued in this State shall contain a provision purporting to reserve discretion to

5 is prescribed or required by the law of the state under which the insurer is
6 organized.
7 (b) Any policy of a domestic health insurer, when issued for delivery in any
8 other state or country, may contain any provision permitted or required by the
9 laws of such other state or country.

11 Nothing in sections 4018–4020, 4023, 4028–4032, 4034, 4036, and 4037 of
12 this title shall apply to or affect:
13 (1) any policy of workers’ compensation insurance or any policy of
14 liability insurance, with or without supplementary coverage;

4 special surrender value or special benefit or an annuity in the event that the
5 insured or annuitant becomes totally and permanently disabled, as defined by
6 the contract or supplemental contract.
7 § 4036. NONCONFORMING POLICIES
8 (a) A health insurance policy shall not contain any provision that makes the
9 policy or any portion of the policy less favorable in any respect to the covered
10 individual than the provisions of the policy that are regulated by sections 4029
11 and 4030 of this title.
12 (b) A policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State in
13 violation of sections 4029 and 4030 of this title shall be held valid but shall be

15 regulated by sections 4029 and 4030 is in conflict with any provision of those
16 sections, the rights, duties, and obligations of the health insurer and the
17 covered individual shall be governed by the provisions of those sections.
18 § 4037. APPLICATIONS FOR INSURANCE
19 (a)(1) A covered individual shall not be bound by any statement made in an
20 application for a policy unless a copy of the application is attached to or
21 endorsed on the policy as a part of the policy when issued.

4 any, for such reinstatement or renewal, the health insurer shall deliver or mail a
5 copy of the application to the individual making the request within 15 days
6 after the receipt of the request. If the health insurer does not deliver or mail the
7 copy within 15 days, the health insurer shall be precluded from introducing the
8 application as evidence in any action or proceeding based on or involving the
9 policy or its reinstatement or renewal.
10 (b) No alteration of a written application for a policy shall be made by any
11 person other than the applicant without the applicant’s written consent, except
12 that insertions may be made by the health insurer, for administrative purposes
13 only, in a manner that indicates clearly that the insertions are not to be ascribed
14 to the applicant.
15 (c) The falsity of any statement in an application for a policy shall not bar
16 the right to recovery under the policy unless the false statement materially
17 affected either the acceptance of the risk or the hazard assumed by the health
18 insurer.
19 § 4038. RULEMAKING ON POLICY FILINGS
20 The Commissioner may adopt such reasonable rules concerning the
21 procedure for the filing or submission of policies subject to sections 4023 and

7 provisions:
8 (1) A provision that the policy; the application of the policyholder, if an
9 application or copy is attached to the policy; and the individual applications, if

11 insurance policies.
12 (2) The Commissioner shall adopt rules for standards and procedure for

21 composite average rate increase in excess of three percent, or any other

AS PASSED BY SENATE S.30
2025 Page 69 of 180
1 coverage changes that the Commissioner determines will have a comparable
2 impact on cost or availability of coverage for a Medicare supplement insurance
3 policy issued by any health insurer with 5,000 or more total lives in the
4 Vermont Medicare supplement insurance market, the Commissioner shall
5 notify the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent Living of the

9 (1) of this subsection, the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent
10 Living shall inform the members of the Advisory Board established pursuant to
11 33 V.S.A. § 505 of the proposed premium increase.
12 (3)(A) The Commissioner shall not approve any request to increase
13 Medicare supplement insurance premium rates unless the amount of the rate
14 increase complies with the statutory standards for approval under sections
15 4026, 4513, 4584, and 5104 of this title. Any approved rate increase shall not
16 be based on an unreasonable change in loss ratio from the previous year, unless
17 the Commissioner makes written findings that such change is necessary to
18 prevent a substantial adverse impact on the financial condition of the health
19 insurer. In acting on such rate increase requests, the Commissioner may deny
20 the request, approve the rate increase as requested, or approve a rate increase in
21 an amount different from the increase requested. A decision by the
VT LEG #380954 v.1
AS PASSED BY SENATE S.30
2025 Page 70 of 180
1 Commissioner other than an approval of the rate requested may be appealed by
2 the health insurer, provided that the burden of proof shall be on the health
3 insurer to show that the approved rate does not meet the statutory standards
4 established under this subsection.
5 (B) Before acting on the rate increase requested, the Commissioner
6 may make such examination or investigation as the Commissioner deems
7 necessary, including where applicable the review process set forth in
8 subdivision (C) of this subdivision (3).

10 for which an independent analysis has been performed pursuant to 33 V.S.A.
11 § 6706 and in which the health insurer’s requested composite average increase,
12 the independent expert’s recommended composite average rate increase, or the
13 Department actuary’s recommended composite average rate increase differ by
14 two percentage points or more, the Commissioner shall hold a public hearing at
15 which the health insurer, the Department’s actuary, the independent expert, any
16 intervenor, and the public will have the opportunity to present written and oral
17 testimony and will be available to answer questions of the Commissioner and
18 those present.
19 (ii) The hearing shall be noticed and held at a time and place so as
20 to facilitate public participation, and shall be recorded and become part of the

1 record before the Commissioner. At the Commissioner’s discretion, the
2 hearing may be conducted remotely.
3 (iii) If the carrier’s requested composite average increase, the
4 independent expert’s recommended composite average increase, or the
5 Department actuary’s recommended composite average increase differs by less
6 than two percentage points, the Department and the parties shall confer by
7 conference call, or by any other available media, to review the rate requests
8 and recommendations. However, a public hearing may be held at the
9 Commissioner’s discretion for good cause shown.
10 (D)(i) In any review held in accordance with this subdivision (3), the
11 Commissioner shall permit intervention by any person whom the
12 Commissioner determines will materially advance the interests of the covered
13 individuals. The intervenor shall have access to and may use the information
14 of the independent expert appointed under 33 V.S.A. § 6706.
15 (ii) The reasonable and necessary cost of intervention as
16 determined by the Commissioner shall be paid by the affected policyholders or
17 certificate holders. The maximum payment shall be $2,500.00 except when
18 waived by the Commissioner for good cause shown. The $2,500.00 maximum
19 amount may be adjusted to reflect, at the Commissioner’s discretion,
20 appropriate inflation factors.

6 (1) A health insurer that issues Medicare supplement insurance policies
7 or certificates to a person eligible for Medicare by reason of age shall make
8 available, to persons eligible for Medicare by reason of disability, the same
9 policies or certificates that are offered and sold to persons eligible for
10 Medicare by reason of age. The initial enrollment period for any such policies
11 or certificates shall be at least six months following the date the individual

9 (1) under a policy or contract issued to any common carrier, which shall
10 be deemed the policyholder, covering a group defined as all persons who may
11 become passengers on such common carrier;
12 (2) under a policy or contract issued to an employer, who shall be

2025 Page 74 of 180
1 (4) under a policy or contract issued in the name of any volunteer fire
2 department, emergency medical services provider, or other such volunteer
3 group, which shall be deemed the policyholder, covering all of the members of
4 the department or group in connection with their department or group
5 activities; or
6 (5) under a policy or contract issued to any other substantially similar
7 group that, in the discretion of the Commissioner and after the prior approval
8 by the Commissioner of the group, may be subject to the issuance of a blanket
9 health policy or contract.
10 (b)(1) No blanket health insurance policy shall contain any provision
11 relating to notice of claim, proofs of loss, time of payment of claims, or time
12 within which legal action must be brought upon the policy that, in the opinion
13 of the Commissioner, is less favorable to the persons insured than would be
14 permitted by the provisions set forth in section 4029 of this title.
15 (2) An individual application shall not be required from a person
16 covered under a blanket health policy or contract, nor shall it be necessary for
17 the insurer to furnish each person a certificate.
18 (3) All benefits under any blanket health policy shall, unless for hospital
19 and physician service or surgical benefits, be payable to the person insured, or
20 to the person’s designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to the person’s
21 estate, except that if the person insured is a minor, the benefits may be made

4 policyholders for the death of, or injury to, any members of the group.
5 (c) No blanket health insurance policy that provides coverage for the
6 payment of all or a portion of the cost of health care services or products shall
7 contain any provision that does not comply with a requirement of this title, or a
8 rule adopted pursuant to this title applicable to health insurance, other than
9 those requirements applicable to nongroup health insurance or small group
10 health insurance. The Commissioner may waive the application to a blanket
11 insurance policy of one or more of the health insurance requirements of this
12 title, or a rule adopted pursuant to this title, if the requirement is not relevant to
13 the types of risks and duration of risks insured against in the blanket insurance
14 policy.

5 (c) A short-term, limited-duration health insurance policy or contract shall
6 be nonrenewable, and a health insurer shall not issue a short-term, limited-
7 duration health insurance policy or contract to any person if the issuance would
8 result in the person being covered by short-term, limited-duration health
9 insurance coverage for more than three months in any 12-month period.
10 (d) A policy or contract for short-term, limited-duration health insurance
11 coverage shall display prominently in the policy or contract and in any
12 application materials provided in connection with enrollment in that coverage,
13 in at least 14-point type, certain disclosures regarding the scope of short-term,
14 limited-duration health insurance coverage, including the types of benefits and
15 consumer protections that are and are not included. The Commissioner shall
16 determine the specific disclosure language that shall be used in all short-term,
17 limited-duration health insurance policies, contracts, and application materials
18 and shall provide the language to the health insurers offering that coverage.

6 coverage of injury, sickness, and necessary care and treatment of medically
7 diagnosed congenital defect or birth abnormality.
8 (2) Coverage for a newly born child shall be provided without notice or
9 additional premium for not less than 60 days after the date of birth. If payment
10 of a specific premium or subscription fee is required in order to have the
11 coverage continue beyond such 60-day period, the policy may require that
12 notification of the birth of the newly born child and payment of the required
13 premium or fees be furnished to the health insurer within a period of not less
14 than 60 days after the date of birth.
15 (c) Adopted child coverage.
16 (1) As used in this section:

1 anticipation of the adoption of the child. The child’s placement with a person
2 terminates upon the termination of such legal obligations.
3 (2) In any case in which a health insurance plan provides coverage for
4 dependent children of covered individuals, the plan shall provide benefits to
5 dependent children placed with covered individuals for adoption under the
6 same terms and conditions as apply to the natural, dependent children of the
7 covered individuals, irrespective of whether the adoption has become final.
8 (3) A health insurance plan shall not restrict coverage under the plan of
9 any dependent child adopted by a covered individual, or placed with a covered
10 individual for adoption, solely on the basis of a preexisting condition of the
11 child at the time that the child would otherwise become eligible for coverage
12 under the plan, if the adoption or placement for adoption occurs while the
13 covered individual is eligible for coverage under the plan.
14 (d) Coverage required until 26 years of age. A health insurance plan that
15 provides dependent coverage of children shall continue to make that coverage
16 available for an adult child until the child attains 26 years of age, provided that
17 this subsection shall not apply to a plan providing coverage for a specified
18 disease or other limited benefit coverage, and further provided that nothing in

2025 Page 89 of 180
1 determination by the Commissioner that the financial circumstances of the

1 instrumentality of the State to its employees. Unless otherwise specified,
2 “health insurance” does not include Vermont Medicaid.
3 (4) “Health insurer” means an insurance company that provides health
4 insurance as defined in subdivision 3301(a)(2) of this title, a nonprofit hospital
5 or medical service corporation, a managed care organization, a health
6 maintenance organization, and, to the extent permitted under federal law, any
7 administrator of an insured, self-insured, or publicly funded health care benefit
8 plan offered by a public or private entity.
9 (5) “Major medical insurance” means a comprehensive health insurance
10 plan that is not specific disease, accident, hospital indemnity, dental care,
11 vision care, disability income, long-term care, Medicare supplement insurance,
12 or other limited-benefit coverage. The term does not include short-term,
13 limited-duration health insurance coverage or a plan under which benefits are
14 paid directly to a covered individual or the individual’s assigns and for which
15 the amount of the benefit is not based on potential medical costs or on actual
16 costs incurred.
17 § 4012. COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL LAW
18 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this title, health insurers, hospital and
19 medical service corporations, and health maintenance organizations that issue,
20 sell, renew, or offer health insurance plans in Vermont shall comply with the
21 requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
VT LEG #380954 v.1

AS PASSED BY SENATE S.30
2025 Page 3 of 180
1 1996, as amended from time to time (42 U.S.C. Chapter 6A, Subchapter
2 XXV), and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, Pub. L.
3 No. 111-148, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act
4 of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-152. The Commissioner shall enforce such
5 requirements pursuant to the Commissioner’s authority under this title.
6 (b)(1) Health insurers, hospital and medical service corporations, health
7 maintenance organizations, and health care providers, as that term is defined in
8 18 V.S.A. § 9432, shall comply with the requirements of the No Surprises Act,
9 Pub. L. No. 116-260, Division BB, Title I, as amended from time to time.
10 (2) The Commissioner shall enforce the requirements of the No
11 Surprises Act as they apply to health insurers, hospital and medical service
12 corporations, health maintenance organizations, and health care providers, to
13 the extent permitted under federal law, pursuant to the Commissioner’s
14 authority under this title. The Commissioner may also refer cases of
15 noncompliance to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under
16 the terms of a collaborative enforcement agreement, or to the Office of the
17 Vermont Attorney General.
18 § 4013. DISCRIMINATION PROHIBITED
19 No health insurer shall make or permit any unfair discrimination between
20 individuals of substantially the same hazard in the amount of premium rates

VT LEG #380954 v.1

AS PASSED BY SENATE S.30

2 premium rates, different benefits, or different underwriting procedure for
3 individuals insured under group, family expense, or blanket plans of insurance.
4 § 4014. ADVERTISING PRACTICES
5 (a) No company doing business in this State, and no insurance agent or
6 broker, shall use in connection with the solicitation of health insurance or
7 pharmacy benefit management any advertising copy or advertising practice or
8 any plan of solicitation that is materially misleading or deceptive. An
9 advertising copy or advertising practice or plan of solicitation shall be
10 considered to be materially misleading or deceptive if by implication or
11 otherwise it transmits information in such manner or of such substance that a
12 prospective applicant for health insurance may be misled by it to the
13 applicant’s material damage.
14 (b)(1) If the Commissioner finds that any such advertising copy or
15 advertising practice or plan of solicitation is materially misleading or
16 deceptive, the Commissioner shall order the company or the agent or broker
17 using such copy or practice or plan to cease and desist from such use.
18 (2) Before making any such finding and order, the Commissioner shall
19 give notice, not less than 10 days in advance, and a hearing to the company,
20 agent, or broker affected.

4 cease and desist, the Commissioner may suspend or revoke the license of such
5 insurer, pharmacy benefit manager, agent, or broker.
6 § 4015. PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS
7 The Commissioner may impose an administrative penalty of up to $750.00
8 on any person who intentionally violates any provision of this chapter or any
9 order of the Commissioner made in accordance with this chapter. The
10 Commissioner may also suspend or revoke the license of a health insurer or
11 agent for any such intentional violation.
12 § 4016. APPEAL
13 (a) Any person aggrieved by any action of the Commissioner may obtain a
14 review by appeal to the Superior Court of Washington County. The appeal
15 shall be based on the record of the proceedings before the Commissioner and
16 shall not be limited to questions of law. If the appeal is from an order of the
17 Commissioner, the order shall not take effect during the pendency of the
18 appeal unless the court determines otherwise.
19 (b) The court may review all the facts and in disposing of any issue before
20 it may modify, affirm, or reverse any order of the Commissioner in whole or in
21 part.

14 (7) The policy does not contain any provision purporting to make any
15 portion of the charter, rules, constitution, or bylaws of the health insurer a part

10 provisions specified in this section using the language set forth in this section;
11 provided, however, that a health insurer may, at its option, substitute different
12 language approved by the Commissioner for one or more provisions, provided
13 the substituted language is not less favorable in any respect to the insured or
14 covered individual than the language used in this section. The provisions
15 specified in this section shall be preceded individually by the caption appearing
16 in this section or, at the option of the health insurer, by such appropriate
17 captions or subcaptions as the Commissioner may approve:
18 (1) ENTIRE CONTRACT; CHANGES: This policy, including the

21 executive officer of the insurer and unless such approval be endorsed hereon or

1 attached hereto. No agent has authority to change this policy or to waive any
2 of its provisions.
3 (2) TIME LIMIT ON CERTAIN DEFENSES: (a) After three years
4 from the date of issue of this policy no misstatements, except fraudulent
5 misstatements, made by the applicant in the application for such policy, shall
6 be used to void the policy or to deny a claim for loss incurred or disability (as
7 defined in the policy) commencing after the expiration of such three year
8 period.
9 After this policy has been in force for a period of three years during the
10 lifetime of the insured (excluding any period during which the insured is
11 disabled), it shall become incontestable as to the statements contained in the
12 application.)
13 (b) No claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy)
14 commencing after three years from the date of issue of this policy shall be
15 reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition not
16 excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective on the date
17 of loss had existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this policy.
18 (3) GRACE PERIOD: A grace period of . . . . (insert a number not less
19 than “7” for weekly premium policies, “10” for monthly premium policies and
20 “31” for all other policies) days will be granted for the payment of each

AS PASSED BY SENATE S.30
2025 Page 28 of 180
1 premium falling due after the first premium, during which grace period the
2 policy shall continue in force.
3 (A policy which contains a cancellation provision may add, at the end of
4 the above provision,
5 subject to the right of the insurer to cancel in accordance with the
6 cancellation provision hereof,
7 A policy in which the insurer reserves the right to refuse any renewal
8 shall have, at the beginning of the above provision,
9 Unless not less than five days prior to the premium due date the insurer has
10 delivered to the insured or has mailed to his or her last address as shown by the
11 records of the insurer written notice of its intention not to renew this policy
12 beyond the period for which the premium has been accepted.)
13 (4) REINSTATEMENT: If any renewal premium be not paid within the
14 time granted the insured for payment, a subsequent acceptance of premium by
15 the insurer or by any agent duly authorized by the insurer to accept such
16 premium, without requiring in connection therewith an application for
17 reinstatement, shall reinstate the policy; provided, however, that if the insurer
18 or such agent requires an application for reinstatement and issues a conditional
19 receipt for the premium tendered, the policy will be reinstated upon approval
20 of such application by the insurer or, lacking such approval, upon the 45th day
21 following the date of such conditional receipt unless the insurer has previously
VT LEG #380954 v.1

AS PASSED BY SENATE S.30
2025 Page 29 of 180
1 notified the insured in writing of its disapproval of such application. The
2 reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from such accidental injury as
3 may be sustained after the date of reinstatement and loss due to such sickness
4 as may begin more than ten days after such date. In all other respects the
5 insured and insurer shall have the same rights thereunder as they had under the
6 policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to
7 any provisions endorsed hereon or attached hereto in connection with the
8 reinstatement. Any premium accepted in connection with a reinstatement shall
9 be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not
10 to any period more than sixty days prior to the date of reinstatement.
11 (The last sentence of the above provision may be omitted from any
12 policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms
13 by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50, or (2) in the case
14 of a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue.)
15 (5) NOTICE OF CLAIM: Written notice of claim must be given to the
16 insurer within 20 days after the occurrence or commencement of any loss
17 covered by the policy, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible. Notice
18 given by or on behalf of the insured or the beneficiary to the insurer at . . . .
19 (insert the location of such office as the insurer may designate for the purpose),
20 or to any authorized agent of the insurer, with information sufficient to identify
21 the insured, shall be deemed notice to the insurer.

1 (In a policy providing a loss-of-time benefit which may be payable for at
2 least two years, an insurer may at its option insert the following between the
3 first and second sentences of the above provision:
4 Subject to the qualifications set forth below, if the insured suffers loss of
5 time on account of disability for which indemnity may be payable for at least
6 two years, he or she shall, at least once in every six months after having given
7 notice of claim, give to the insurer notice of continuance of said disability,
8 except in the event of legal incapacity. The period of six months following any
9 filing of proof by the insured or any payment by the insurer on account of such
10 claim or any denial of liability in whole or in part by the insurer shall be
11 excluded in applying this provision. Delay in the giving of such notice shall
12 not impair the insured’s right to any indemnity which would otherwise have
13 accrued during the period of six months preceding the date on which such
14 notice is actually given.)
15 (6) CLAIM FORMS: The insurer, upon receipt of a notice of claim, will
16 furnish to the claimant such forms as are usually furnished by it for filing
17 proofs of loss. If such forms are not furnished within 15 days after the giving
18 of such notice the claimant shall be deemed to have complied with the
19 requirements of this policy as to proof of loss upon submitting, within the time
20 fixed in the policy for filing proofs of loss, written proof covering the
21 occurrence, the character and the extent of the loss for which claim is made.

1 (7) PROOFS OF LOSS: Written proof of loss must be furnished to the
2 insurer at its said office in case of claim for loss for which this policy provides
3 any periodic payment contingent upon continuing loss within 90 days after the
4 termination of the period for which the insurer is liable and in case of claim for
5 any other loss within 90 days after the date of such loss. Failure to furnish
6 such proof within the time required shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if
7 it was not reasonably possible to give proof within such time, provided such
8 proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the
9 absence of legal capacity, later than one year from the time proof is otherwise
10 required.
11 (8) TIME OF PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Indemnities payable under this
12 policy for any loss other than loss for which this policy provides any periodic
13 payment will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof of such
14 loss. Subject to due written proof of loss, all accrued indemnities for loss for
15 which this policy provides periodic payment will be paid . . . . (insert period for
16 payment which must not be less frequently than monthly) and any balance
17 remaining unpaid upon the termination of liability will be paid immediately
18 upon receipt of due written proof.
19 (9) PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Indemnity for loss of life will be payable in
20 accordance with the beneficiary designation and the provisions respecting such
21 payment which may be prescribed herein and effective at the time of payment.

1 If no such designation or provision is then effective, such indemnity shall be
2 payable to the estate of the insured. Any other accrued indemnities unpaid at
3 the insured’s death may, at the option of the insurer, be paid either to such
4 beneficiary or to such estate. All other indemnities will be payable to the
5 insured.
6 (The following provisions, or either of them, may be included with the
7 foregoing provision at the option of the insurer:
8 If any indemnity of this policy shall be payable to the estate of the insured,
9 or to an insured or beneficiary who is a minor or otherwise not competent to
10 give a valid release, the insurer may pay such indemnity, up to an amount not
11 exceeding $. . . . . . (insert an amount which shall not exceed $1,000.00), to any
12 relative by blood or connection by civil marriage of the insured or beneficiary
13 who is deemed by the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto. Any payment
14 made by the insurer in good faith pursuant to this provision shall fully
15 discharge the insurer to the extent of such payment.
16 Subject to any written direction of the insured in the application or
17 otherwise all or a portion of any indemnities provided by this policy on
18 account of hospital, nursing, medical, or surgical services may, at the insurer’s
19 option and unless the insured requests otherwise in writing not later than the
20 time of filing proofs of such loss, be paid directly to the hospital or person

1 rendering such services; but it is not required that the service be rendered by a
2 particular hospital or person.)
3 (10) PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS AND AUTOPSY: The insurer at its
4 own expense shall have the right and the opportunity to examine the person of
5 the insured when and as often as it may reasonably require during the
6 pendency of a claim hereunder and to make an autopsy in case of death where
7 it is not forbidden by law.
8 (11) LEGAL ACTIONS: No action at law or in equity shall be brought to
9 recover on this policy prior to the expiration of 60 days after written proof of
10 loss has been furnished in accordance with the requirements of this policy. No
11 such action shall be brought after the expiration of three years after the time
12 written proof of loss is required to be furnished.
13 (12) CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY: Unless the insured makes an
14 irrevocable designation of beneficiary, the right to change of beneficiary is
15 reserved to the insured and the consent of the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall
16 not be requisite to surrender or assignment of this policy or to any change of
17 beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to any other changes in this policy.

1 § 4030. OPTIONAL STANDARD POLICY PROVISIONS
2 Except as provided in section 4031 of this title, no health insurance policy
3 delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State shall contain
4 provisions respecting the matters set forth in this section unless the provisions
5 use the language set forth in this section; provided, however, that a health
6 insurer may, at its option, substitute different language approved by the
7 Commissioner for one or more provisions, provided the substituted language is
8 not less favorable in any respect to the insured or covered individual than the
9 language used in this section. Any provision set forth in this section that is
10 contained in the policy shall be preceded individually by the appropriate
11 caption appearing in this section or, at the option of the health insurer, by such
12 appropriate captions or subcaptions as the Commissioner may approve:
13 (1) CHANGE OF OCCUPATION: If the insured be injured or contract
14 sickness after having changed his or her occupation to one classified by the
15 insurer as more hazardous than that stated in this policy or while doing for
16 compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so classified, the insurer
17 will pay only such portion of the indemnities provided in this policy as the
18 premium paid would have purchased at the rates and within the limits fixed by
19 the insurer for such more hazardous occupation. If the insured changes his or
20 her occupation to one classified by the insurer as less hazardous than that
21 stated in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of such change of
VT LEG #380954 v.1

AS PASSED BY SENATE S.30

1 occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly, and will return the
2 excess pro rata unearned premium from the date of change of occupation or
3 from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of such proof,
4 whichever is the more recent. In applying this provision, the classification of
5 occupational risk and the premium rates shall be such as have been last filed by
6 the insurer prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable or
7 prior to date of proof of change in occupation with the state official having
8 supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided at the time this
9 policy was issued; but if such filing was not required, then the classification of
10 occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by
11 the insurer in such state prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the date
12 of proof of change in occupation.
13 (2) MISSTATEMENT OF AGE: If the age of the insured has been
14 misstated, all amounts payable under this policy shall be such as the premium
15 paid would have purchased at the correct age.
16 (3) OTHER INSURANCE IN THIS INSURER: If an accident or
17 sickness or accident and sickness policy or policies previously issued by the
18 insurer to the insured be in force concurrently herewith, making the aggregate
19 indemnity for .... (insert type of coverage or coverages) in excess of
20 $ .................... (insert maximum limit of indemnity or indemnities) the excess

1 insurance shall be void and all premiums paid for such excess shall be returned
2 to the insured or to his or her estate.
3 Insurance effective at any one time on the insured under a like policy or
4 policies in this insurer is limited to the one such policy elected by the insured,
5 his or her beneficiary or his or her estate, as the case may be, and the insurer
6 will return all premiums paid for all other such policies.
7 (4) INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS: If there be other valid
8 coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a
9 provision of service basis or on an expense incurred basis and of which this
10 insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or
11 commencement of loss, the only liability under any expense incurred coverage
12 of this policy shall be for such proportion of the loss as the amount which
13 would otherwise have been payable hereunder plus the total of the like
14 amounts under all such other valid coverages for the same loss of which this
15 insurer had notice bears to the total like amounts under all valid coverages for
16 such loss, and for the return of such portion of the premiums paid as shall
17 exceed the pro rata portion for the amount so determined. For the purpose of
18 applying this provision when other coverage is on a provision of service basis,
19 the “like amount” of such other coverage shall be taken as the amount which
20 the services rendered would have cost in the absence of such coverage.

5 definition of “other valid coverage,” approved as to form by the

7 provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by
8 insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any

3 than an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given
4 written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only
5 liability for such benefits under this policy shall be for such proportion of the
6 indemnities otherwise provided hereunder for such loss as the like indemnities
7 of which the insurer had notice (including the indemnities under this policy)
8 bear to the total amount of all like indemnities for such loss, and for the return
9 of such portion of the premium paid as shall exceed the pro rata portion for the
10 indemnities thus determined.

18 state of the United States or any province of Canada, and to any other coverage
19 the inclusion of which may be approved by the Commissioner. In the absence

4 compensation or employer’s liability statute) whether provided by a
5 governmental agency or otherwise shall in all cases be deemed to be “other
6 valid coverage” of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing
7 policy provision no third party liability coverage shall be included as “other
8 valid coverage.”)
9 (6) RELATION OF EARNINGS TO INSURANCE: If the total monthly
10 amount of loss of time benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss
11 of time coverage upon the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly
12 basis, shall exceed the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability
13 commenced or his or her average monthly earnings for the period of two years
14 immediately preceding a disability for which claim is made, whichever is the
15 greater, the insurer will be liable only for such proportionate amount of such
16 benefits under this policy as the amount of such monthly earnings or such
17 average monthly earnings of the insured bears to the total amount of monthly
18 benefits for the same loss under all such coverage upon the insured at the time
19 such disability commences and for the return of such part of the premiums paid
20 during such two years as shall exceed the pro rata amount of the premiums for
21 the benefits actually paid hereunder; but this shall not operate to reduce the

1 total monthly amount of benefits payable under all such coverage upon the
2 insured below the sum of $200.00 or the sum of the monthly benefits specified
3 in such coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to reduce
4 benefits other than those payable for loss of time.
5 (The foregoing policy provision may be inserted only in a policy which
6 the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely
7 payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50; or (2) in the case of a policy

2 any premium then due and unpaid or covered by any note or written order may
3 be deducted therefrom.
4 (8) CANCELLATION: The insurer may cancel this policy at any time by
5 written notice delivered to the insured, or mailed to his or her last address as
6 shown by the records of the insurer, stating when, not less than five days
7 thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective; and after the policy has been
8 continued beyond its original term the insured may cancel this policy at any
9 time by written notice delivered or mailed to the insurer, effective upon receipt
10 or on such later date as may be specified in such notice. In the event of
11 cancellation, the insurer will return promptly the unearned portion of any
12 premium paid. If the insured cancels, the earned premium shall be computed

14 supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided when the policy
15 was issued. If the insurer cancels, the earned premium shall be computed pro

4 (a) The purpose of this section is to ensure that health insurance benefits,
5 disability income protection coverage, and life insurance benefits are
6 contractually guaranteed and to avoid the conflict of interest that may occur
7 when the carrier responsible for providing benefits has discretionary authority
8 to decide what benefits are due. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
9 impose any requirement or duty on any person other than a health insurer or a
10 health insurer offering disability income protection coverage or life insurance.
11 (b) As used in this section:
12 (1) “Disability income protection coverage” means a policy, contract,
13 certificate, or agreement that provides for weekly, monthly, or other periodic
14 payments for a specified period during the continuance of disability resulting
15 from illness, injury, or a combination of illness and injury.
16 (2) “Health insurer” has the same meaning as in section 4021 of this
17 chapter and, as used in this section, also includes entities offering policies for
18 specific disease, accident, injury, hospital indemnity, dental care, disability
19 income, long-term care, and other limited benefit coverage.
20 (3) “Life insurance” means a policy, contract, certificate, or agreement
21 that provides life insurance as defined in subdivision 3301(a)(1) of this title.

11 insurance policies.
12 (2) The Commissioner shall adopt rules for standards and procedure for

3 policy issued by any health insurer with 5,000 or more total lives in the
4 Vermont Medicare supplement insurance market, the Commissioner shall
5 notify the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent Living of the

11 33 V.S.A. § 505 of the proposed premium increase.
12 (3)(A) The Commissioner shall not approve any request to increase
13 Medicare supplement insurance premium rates unless the amount of the rate
14 increase complies with the statutory standards for approval under sections
15 4026, 4513, 4584, and 5104 of this title. Any approved rate increase shall not
16 be based on an unreasonable change in loss ratio from the previous year, unless
17 the Commissioner makes written findings that such change is necessary to
18 prevent a substantial adverse impact on the financial condition of the health
19 insurer. In acting on such rate increase requests, the Commissioner may deny
20 the request, approve the rate increase as requested, or approve a rate increase in
21 an amount different from the increase requested. A decision by the

3 insurer to show that the approved rate does not meet the statutory standards
4 established under this subsection.
5 (B) Before acting on the rate increase requested, the Commissioner
6 may make such examination or investigation as the Commissioner deems
7 necessary, including where applicable the review process set forth in

12 the independent expert’s recommended composite average rate increase, or the
13 Department actuary’s recommended composite average rate increase differ by
14 two percentage points or more, the Commissioner shall hold a public hearing at
15 which the health insurer, the Department’s actuary, the independent expert, any
16 intervenor, and the public will have the opportunity to present written and oral
17 testimony and will be available to answer questions of the Commissioner and
18 those present.
19 (ii) The hearing shall be noticed and held at a time and place so as
20 to facilitate public participation, and shall be recorded and become part of the

3 (iii) If the carrier’s requested composite average increase, the
4 independent expert’s recommended composite average increase, or the
5 Department actuary’s recommended composite average increase differs by less
6 than two percentage points, the Department and the parties shall confer by
7 conference call, or by any other available media, to review the rate requests
8 and recommendations. However, a public hearing may be held at the
9 Commissioner’s discretion for good cause shown.
10 (D)(i) In any review held in accordance with this subdivision (3), the
11 Commissioner shall permit intervention by any person whom the
12 Commissioner determines will materially advance the interests of the covered
13 individuals. The intervenor shall have access to and may use the information
14 of the independent expert appointed under 33 V.S.A. § 6706.
15 (ii) The reasonable and necessary cost of intervention as
16 determined by the Commissioner shall be paid by the affected policyholders or

18 waived by the Commissioner for good cause shown. The $2,500.00 maximum
19 amount may be adjusted to reflect, at the Commissioner’s discretion,
20 appropriate inflation factors.

7 health care services or products, and that covers special groups of persons as

9 (1) under a policy or contract issued to any common carrier, which shall
10 be deemed the policyholder, covering a group defined as all persons who may
11 become passengers on such common carrier;
12 (2) under a policy or contract issued to an employer, who shall be
13 deemed the policyholder, covering any group of employees defined by

16 school, or approved education program, as those terms are defined in
17 16 V.S.A. § 11; to a postsecondary school, as defined in 16 V.S.A.
18 § 176(b)(1); or to a prequalified private prekindergarten provider, as defined in

2025 Page 74 of 180
1 (4) under a policy or contract issued in the name of any volunteer fire
2 department, emergency medical services provider, or other such volunteer
3 group, which shall be deemed the policyholder, covering all of the members of
4 the department or group in connection with their department or group
5 activities; or
6 (5) under a policy or contract issued to any other substantially similar
7 group that, in the discretion of the Commissioner and after the prior approval
8 by the Commissioner of the group, may be subject to the issuance of a blanket
9 health policy or contract.
10 (b)(1) No blanket health insurance policy shall contain any provision
11 relating to notice of claim, proofs of loss, time of payment of claims, or time
12 within which legal action must be brought upon the policy that, in the opinion
13 of the Commissioner, is less favorable to the persons insured than would be
14 permitted by the provisions set forth in section 4029 of this title.
15 (2) An individual application shall not be required from a person
16 covered under a blanket health policy or contract, nor shall it be necessary for
17 the insurer to furnish each person a certificate.
18 (3) All benefits under any blanket health policy shall, unless for hospital
19 and physician service or surgical benefits, be payable to the person insured, or
20 to the person’s designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to the person’s

4 policyholders for the death of, or injury to, any members of the group.
5 (c) No blanket health insurance policy that provides coverage for the
6 payment of all or a portion of the cost of health care services or products shall
7 contain any provision that does not comply with a requirement of this title, or a
8 rule adopted pursuant to this title applicable to health insurance, other than
9 those requirements applicable to nongroup health insurance or small group
10 health insurance. The Commissioner may waive the application to a blanket
11 insurance policy of one or more of the health insurance requirements of this
12 title, or a rule adopted pursuant to this title, if the requirement is not relevant to
13 the types of risks and duration of risks insured against in the blanket insurance

5 (c) A short-term, limited-duration health insurance policy or contract shall
6 be nonrenewable, and a health insurer shall not issue a short-term, limited-
7 duration health insurance policy or contract to any person if the issuance would
8 result in the person being covered by short-term, limited-duration health
9 insurance coverage for more than three months in any 12-month period.
10 (d) A policy or contract for short-term, limited-duration health insurance
11 coverage shall display prominently in the policy or contract and in any

13 in at least 14-point type, certain disclosures regarding the scope of short-term,
14 limited-duration health insurance coverage, including the types of benefits and
15 consumer protections that are and are not included. The Commissioner shall

3 (2) In any case in which a health insurance plan provides coverage for
4 dependent children of covered individuals, the plan shall provide benefits to
5 dependent children placed with covered individuals for adoption under the
6 same terms and conditions as apply to the natural, dependent children of the
7 covered individuals, irrespective of whether the adoption has become final.
8 (3) A health insurance plan shall not restrict coverage under the plan of
9 any dependent child adopted by a covered individual, or placed with a covered
10 individual for adoption, solely on the basis of a preexisting condition of the

9 (B) became so incapable prior to attainment of the limiting age; and

13 any person based upon the existence of such a condition; provided, however,
14 that a health insurance plan may require reasonable periodic proof of a
15 continuing condition not more frequently than once every year.
16 (f) Coverage of leave of absence from college. A health insurance plan that

16 care service. The independent review shall be available when requested in

AS PASSED BY SENATE S.30
2025 Page 89 of 180
1 determination by the Commissioner that the financial circumstances of the
