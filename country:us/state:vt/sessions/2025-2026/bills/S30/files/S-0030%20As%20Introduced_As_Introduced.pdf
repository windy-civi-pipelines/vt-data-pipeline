14 major medical insurance coverage, whether it ensures equal access to
15 appropriate mental health care in a manner equivalent to other aspects of health
16 care as part of an integrated, holistic system of care. The Commissioner shall
17 make a determination within 30 days after the date the insurer filed the policy
18 form, premium rate, or rule with the Department. At the expiration of the 30-
19 day period, the form, premium rate, or rule shall be deemed approved unless
20 prior to then it has been affirmatively approved or disapproved by the
21 Commissioner or found to be incomplete. The Commissioner shall notify a

3 subsection. In such notice, the Commissioner shall state that a hearing will be
4 granted within 20 days upon the insurer’s written request.
5 (i) Notwithstanding the procedures and timelines set forth in subsections
6 (a) through (e) of this section, the Board may establish, by rule, a streamlined
7 rate review process for certain rate decisions, including proposed rates
8 affecting fewer than a minimum number of covered lives and proposed rates
9 for which a de minimis increase, as defined by the Board by rule, is sought.
10 § 4027. FILING FEES
11 Each filing of a policy, contract, or document form or premium rates or

13 payment to the Commissioner or the Green Mountain Care Board, as
14 appropriate, of a nonrefundable fee of $150.00.

VT LEG #380165 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.30
2025 Page 25 of 181
1 (2) The policy sets forth the time at which the insurance takes effect and
2 terminates.
3 (3) The policy purports to insure only one person, except that a policy
4 may insure, originally or by subsequent amendment, upon the application of an
5 adult member of a family who shall be deemed the policyholder, any two or

12 in light-faced type of a style in general use, the size of which shall be uniform
13 and not less than 10-point with a lowercase unspaced alphabet length not less

15 matter except the name and address of the insurer; the name or title of the

1 exception or reduction specifically applies only to a particular benefit of the
2 policy, the statement of the exception or reduction shall be included with the

8 of the policy unless that portion is set forth in full in the policy, except in the
9 case of the incorporation of, or reference to, a statement of rates or
10 classification of risks or a short-rate table filed with the Commissioner.
11 (8) Either prominently printed on or attached to the first page of the
12 policy is a notice to the effect that during a period of 30 days following the

14 and 10 days following the date of delivery to all other persons, the policy may
15 be surrendered to the insurer together with a written request for cancellation of
16 the policy, and that in such event, the insurer will refund any premium paid,
17 including any policy fees or other charges; provided, however, that this
18 subdivision shall not apply to single premium nonrenewable policies insuring
19 against accident only or medical costs or accidental bodily injury only.

4 provisions specified in this section using the language set forth in this section;
5 provided, however, that a health insurer may, at its option, substitute different
6 language approved by the Commissioner for one or more provisions, provided

8 covered individual than the language used in this section. The provisions
9 specified in this section shall be preceded individually by the caption appearing
10 in this section or, at the option of the health insurer, by such appropriate
11 captions or subcaptions as the Commissioner may approve:
12 (1) ENTIRE CONTRACT; CHANGES: This policy, including the
13 endorsements and the attached papers, if any, constitutes the entire contract of
14 insurance. No change in this policy shall be valid until approved by an
15 executive officer of the insurer and unless such approval be endorsed hereon or
16 attached hereto. No agent has authority to change this policy or to waive any
17 of its provisions.
18 (2) TIME LIMIT ON CERTAIN DEFENSES: (a) After three years
19 from the date of issue of this policy no misstatements, except fraudulent
20 misstatements, made by the applicant in the application for such policy, shall
21 be used to void the policy or to deny a claim for loss incurred or disability (as
VT LEG #380165 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.30
2025 Page 28 of 181
1 defined in the policy) commencing after the expiration of such three year
2 period.
3 After this policy has been in force for a period of three years during the
4 lifetime of the insured (excluding any period during which the insured is
5 disabled), it shall become incontestable as to the statements contained in the
6 application.)
7 (b) No claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy)
8 commencing after three years from the date of issue of this policy shall be
9 reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition not
10 excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective on the date
11 of loss had existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this policy.
12 (3) GRACE PERIOD: A grace period of . . . . (insert a number not less
13 than “7” for weekly premium policies, “10” for monthly premium policies and
14 “31” for all other policies) days will be granted for the payment of each
15 premium falling due after the first premium, during which grace period the
16 policy shall continue in force.
17 (A policy which contains a cancellation provision may add, at the end of
18 the above provision,
19 subject to the right of the insurer to cancel in accordance with the
20 cancellation provision hereof,

1 A policy in which the insurer reserves the right to refuse any renewal
2 shall have, at the beginning of the above provision,
3 Unless not less than five days prior to the premium due date the insurer has
4 delivered to the insured or has mailed to his or her last address as shown by the
5 records of the insurer written notice of its intention not to renew this policy
6 beyond the period for which the premium has been accepted.)
7 (4) REINSTATEMENT: If any renewal premium be not paid within the
8 time granted the insured for payment, a subsequent acceptance of premium by
9 the insurer or by any agent duly authorized by the insurer to accept such
10 premium, without requiring in connection therewith an application for
11 reinstatement, shall reinstate the policy; provided, however, that if the insurer
12 or such agent requires an application for reinstatement and issues a conditional
13 receipt for the premium tendered, the policy will be reinstated upon approval
14 of such application by the insurer or, lacking such approval, upon the 45th day
15 following the date of such conditional receipt unless the insurer has previously
16 notified the insured in writing of its disapproval of such application. The
17 reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from such accidental injury as
18 may be sustained after the date of reinstatement and loss due to such sickness
19 as may begin more than ten days after such date. In all other respects the
20 insured and insurer shall have the same rights thereunder as they had under the
21 policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to
VT LEG #380165 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.30
2025 Page 30 of 181
1 any provisions endorsed hereon or attached hereto in connection with the
2 reinstatement. Any premium accepted in connection with a reinstatement shall
3 be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not
4 to any period more than sixty days prior to the date of reinstatement.
5 (The last sentence of the above provision may be omitted from any
6 policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms
7 by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50, or (2) in the case
8 of a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue.)
9 (5) NOTICE OF CLAIM: Written notice of claim must be given to the
10 insurer within 20 days after the occurrence or commencement of any loss
11 covered by the policy, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible. Notice
12 given by or on behalf of the insured or the beneficiary to the insurer at . . . .
13 (insert the location of such office as the insurer may designate for the purpose),
14 or to any authorized agent of the insurer, with information sufficient to identify
15 the insured, shall be deemed notice to the insurer.
16 (In a policy providing a loss-of-time benefit which may be payable for at
17 least two years, an insurer may at its option insert the following between the
18 first and second sentences of the above provision:
19 Subject to the qualifications set forth below, if the insured suffers loss of
20 time on account of disability for which indemnity may be payable for at least
21 two years, he or she shall, at least once in every six months after having given
VT LEG #380165 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.30
2025 Page 31 of 181
1 notice of claim, give to the insurer notice of continuance of said disability,
2 except in the event of legal incapacity. The period of six months following any
3 filing of proof by the insured or any payment by the insurer on account of such
4 claim or any denial of liability in whole or in part by the insurer shall be
5 excluded in applying this provision. Delay in the giving of such notice shall
6 not impair the insured’s right to any indemnity which would otherwise have
7 accrued during the period of six months preceding the date on which such
8 notice is actually given.)
9 (6) CLAIM FORMS: The insurer, upon receipt of a notice of claim, will
10 furnish to the claimant such forms as are usually furnished by it for filing
11 proofs of loss. If such forms are not furnished within 15 days after the giving
12 of such notice the claimant shall be deemed to have complied with the
13 requirements of this policy as to proof of loss upon submitting, within the time
14 fixed in the policy for filing proofs of loss, written proof covering the
15 occurrence, the character and the extent of the loss for which claim is made.
16 (7) PROOFS OF LOSS: Written proof of loss must be furnished to the
17 insurer at its said office in case of claim for loss for which this policy provides
18 any periodic payment contingent upon continuing loss within 90 days after the
19 termination of the period for which the insurer is liable and in case of claim for
20 any other loss within 90 days after the date of such loss. Failure to furnish
21 such proof within the time required shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.30

1 it was not reasonably possible to give proof within such time, provided such
2 proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the
3 absence of legal capacity, later than one year from the time proof is otherwise
4 required.
5 (8) TIME OF PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Indemnities payable under this
6 policy for any loss other than loss for which this policy provides any periodic
7 payment will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof of such
8 loss. Subject to due written proof of loss, all accrued indemnities for loss for
9 which this policy provides periodic payment will be paid . . . . (insert period for
10 payment which must not be less frequently than monthly) and any balance
11 remaining unpaid upon the termination of liability will be paid immediately
12 upon receipt of due written proof.
13 (9) PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Indemnity for loss of life will be payable in
14 accordance with the beneficiary designation and the provisions respecting such
15 payment which may be prescribed herein and effective at the time of payment.
16 If no such designation or provision is then effective, such indemnity shall be
17 payable to the estate of the insured. Any other accrued indemnities unpaid at
18 the insured’s death may, at the option of the insurer, be paid either to such
19 beneficiary or to such estate. All other indemnities will be payable to the
20 insured.

1 (The following provisions, or either of them, may be included with the
2 foregoing provision at the option of the insurer:
3 If any indemnity of this policy shall be payable to the estate of the insured,
4 or to an insured or beneficiary who is a minor or otherwise not competent to
5 give a valid release, the insurer may pay such indemnity, up to an amount not
6 exceeding $. . . . . . (insert an amount which shall not exceed $1,000.00), to any
7 relative by blood or connection by civil marriage of the insured or beneficiary
8 who is deemed by the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto. Any payment
9 made by the insurer in good faith pursuant to this provision shall fully
10 discharge the insurer to the extent of such payment.
11 Subject to any written direction of the insured in the application or
12 otherwise all or a portion of any indemnities provided by this policy on
13 account of hospital, nursing, medical, or surgical services may, at the insurer’s
14 option and unless the insured requests otherwise in writing not later than the
15 time of filing proofs of such loss, be paid directly to the hospital or person
16 rendering such services; but it is not required that the service be rendered by a
17 particular hospital or person.)
18 (10) PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS AND AUTOPSY: The insurer at its
19 own expense shall have the right and the opportunity to examine the person of
20 the insured when and as often as it may reasonably require during the

3 (11) LEGAL ACTIONS: No action at law or in equity shall be brought to
4 recover on this policy prior to the expiration of 60 days after written proof of
5 loss has been furnished in accordance with the requirements of this policy. No
6 such action shall be brought after the expiration of three years after the time
7 written proof of loss is required to be furnished.
8 (12) CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY: Unless the insured makes an
9 irrevocable designation of beneficiary, the right to change of beneficiary is
10 reserved to the insured and the consent of the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall
11 not be requisite to surrender or assignment of this policy or to any change of
12 beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to any other changes in this policy.
13 (The first clause of this provision, relative to the irrevocable designation
14 of beneficiary, may be omitted at the insurer’s option.)
15 § 4030. OPTIONAL STANDARD POLICY PROVISIONS
16 Except as provided in section 4031 of this title, no health insurance policy
17 delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State shall contain
18 provisions respecting the matters set forth in this section unless the provisions
19 use the language set forth in this section; provided, however, that a health
20 insurer may, at its option, substitute different language approved by the
21 Commissioner for one or more provisions, provided the substituted language is
VT LEG #380165 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.30
2025 Page 35 of 181
1 not less favorable in any respect to the insured or covered individual than the
2 language used in this section. Any provision set forth in this section that is
3 contained in the policy shall be preceded individually by the appropriate
4 caption appearing in this section or, at the option of the health insurer, by such
5 appropriate captions or subcaptions as the Commissioner may approve:
6 (1) CHANGE OF OCCUPATION: If the insured be injured or contract
7 sickness after having changed his or her occupation to one classified by the
8 insurer as more hazardous than that stated in this policy or while doing for
9 compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so classified, the insurer
10 will pay only such portion of the indemnities provided in this policy as the
11 premium paid would have purchased at the rates and within the limits fixed by
12 the insurer for such more hazardous occupation. If the insured changes his or
13 her occupation to one classified by the insurer as less hazardous than that
14 stated in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of such change of
15 occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly, and will return the
16 excess pro rata unearned premium from the date of change of occupation or
17 from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of such proof,
18 whichever is the more recent. In applying this provision, the classification of
19 occupational risk and the premium rates shall be such as have been last filed by
20 the insurer prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable or
21 prior to date of proof of change in occupation with the state official having
VT LEG #380165 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.30
2025 Page 36 of 181
1 supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided at the time this
2 policy was issued; but if such filing was not required, then the classification of
3 occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by
4 the insurer in such state prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the date
5 of proof of change in occupation.
6 (2) MISSTATEMENT OF AGE: If the age of the insured has been
7 misstated, all amounts payable under this policy shall be such as the premium
8 paid would have purchased at the correct age.
9 (3) OTHER INSURANCE IN THIS INSURER: If an accident or
10 sickness or accident and sickness policy or policies previously issued by the
11 insurer to the insured be in force concurrently herewith, making the aggregate
12 indemnity for .... (insert type of coverage or coverages) in excess of $
13 .................... (insert maximum limit of indemnity or indemnities) the excess
14 insurance shall be void and all premiums paid for such excess shall be returned
15 to the insured or to his or her estate.
16 Insurance effective at any one time on the insured under a like policy or
17 policies in this insurer is limited to the one such policy elected by the insured,
18 his or her beneficiary or his or her estate, as the case may be, and the insurer
19 will return all premiums paid for all other such policies.
20 (4) INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS: If there be other valid
21 coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a
VT LEG #380165 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.30
2025 Page 37 of 181
1 provision of service basis or on an expense incurred basis and of which this
2 insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or
3 commencement of loss, the only liability under any expense incurred coverage
4 of this policy shall be for such proportion of the loss as the amount which
5 would otherwise have been payable hereunder plus the total of the like
6 amounts under all such other valid coverages for the same loss of which this
7 insurer had notice bears to the total like amounts under all valid coverages for
8 such loss, and for the return of such portion of the premiums paid as shall
9 exceed the pro rata portion for the amount so determined. For the purpose of
10 applying this provision when other coverage is on a provision of service basis,
11 the “like amount” of such other coverage shall be taken as the amount which
12 the services rendered would have cost in the absence of such coverage.
13 (If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also
14 contains the next following policy provision there shall be added to the caption
15 of the foregoing provision the phrase “—EXPENSE INCURRED

17 definition of “other valid coverage,” approved as to form by the
18 Commissioner, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage

3 group insurance, automobile medical payments insurance, or coverage
4 provided by hospital or medical service organizations or by union welfare

6 applying the foregoing policy provision with respect to any insured, any
7 amount of benefit provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory
8 benefit statute (including any workers’ compensation or employer’s liability
9 statute) whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise shall in all
10 cases be deemed to be “other valid coverage” of which the insurer has had
11 notice. In applying the foregoing policy provision no third party liability
12 coverage shall be included as “other valid coverage.”)
13 (5) INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS: If there be other valid
14 coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on other
15 than an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given
16 written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only
17 liability for such benefits under this policy shall be for such proportion of the
18 indemnities otherwise provided hereunder for such loss as the like indemnities
19 of which the insurer had notice (including the indemnities under this policy)
20 bear to the total amount of all like indemnities for such loss, and for the return

5 of the foregoing provision the phrase “—OTHER BENEFITS.” The insurer
6 may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “other valid
7 coverage,” approved as to form by the Commissioner, which definition shall be
8 limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to
9 regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other
10 state of the United States or any province of Canada, and to any other coverage
11 the inclusion of which may be approved by the Commissioner. In the absence
12 of such definition such term shall not include group insurance, or benefits
13 provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit
14 organizations. For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy provision with
15 respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such insured
16 pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers’
17 compensation or employer’s liability statute) whether provided by a
18 governmental agency or otherwise shall in all cases be deemed to be “other
19 valid coverage” of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing
20 policy provision no third party liability coverage shall be included as “other

3 of time coverage upon the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly
4 basis, shall exceed the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability
5 commenced or his or her average monthly earnings for the period of two years
6 immediately preceding a disability for which claim is made, whichever is the
7 greater, the insurer will be liable only for such proportionate amount of such
8 benefits under this policy as the amount of such monthly earnings or such
9 average monthly earnings of the insured bears to the total amount of monthly
10 benefits for the same loss under all such coverage upon the insured at the time
11 such disability commences and for the return of such part of the premiums paid
12 during such two years as shall exceed the pro rata amount of the premiums for
13 the benefits actually paid hereunder; but this shall not operate to reduce the
14 total monthly amount of benefits payable under all such coverage upon the
15 insured below the sum of $200.00 or the sum of the monthly benefits specified
16 in such coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to reduce
17 benefits other than those payable for loss of time.
18 (The foregoing policy provision may be inserted only in a policy which
19 the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely
20 payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50; or (2) in the case of a policy
21 issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue. The insurer

1 may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “valid loss of time
2 coverage,” approved as to form by the Commissioner, which definition shall be
3 limited in subject matter to coverage provided by governmental agencies or by
4 organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities
5 of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, or to
6 any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the
7 Commissioner or any combination of such coverages. In the absence of such
8 definition such term shall not include any coverage provided for such insured
9 pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers’
10 compensation or employer’s liability statute), or benefits provided by union
11 welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations.)
12 (7) UNPAID PREMIUM: Upon the payment of a claim under this policy,
13 any premium then due and unpaid or covered by any note or written order may
14 be deducted therefrom.
15 (8) CANCELLATION: The insurer may cancel this policy at any time by
16 written notice delivered to the insured, or mailed to his or her last address as
17 shown by the records of the insurer, stating when, not less than five days
18 thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective; and after the policy has been
19 continued beyond its original term the insured may cancel this policy at any
20 time by written notice delivered or mailed to the insurer, effective upon receipt
21 or on such later date as may be specified in such notice. In the event of
VT LEG #380165 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.30
2025 Page 42 of 181
1 cancellation, the insurer will return promptly the unearned portion of any
2 premium paid. If the insured cancels, the earned premium shall be computed
3 by the use of the short-rate table last filed with the state official having
4 supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided when the policy
5 was issued. If the insurer cancels, the earned premium shall be computed pro
6 rata. Cancellation shall be without prejudice to any claim originating prior to
7 the effective date of cancellation.
8 (9) CONFORMITY WITH STATE STATUTES: Any provision of this
9 policy which, on its effective date, is in conflict with the statutes of the state in
10 which the insured resides on such date is hereby amended to conform to the
11 minimum requirements of such statutes.
12 (10) ILLEGAL OCCUPATION: The insurer shall not be liable for any
13 loss to which a contributing cause was the insured’s commission of or attempt
14 to commit a felony or to which a contributing cause was the insured’s being
15 engaged in an illegal occupation.
16 § 4031. OMISSION OF INAPPLICABLE OR INCONSISTENT
17 STANDARD PROVISIONS
18 If any provision of sections 4029 and 4030 of this title is in whole or in part
19 inapplicable to or inconsistent with the coverage provided by a particular form
20 of policy, the health insurer, with the approval of the Commissioner, shall omit
21 from such policy any inapplicable provision or part of a provision, and shall

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.30

5 The provisions specified in sections 4029 and 4030 of this title, or any
6 corresponding provisions used in lieu of those provisions as permitted by those
7 sections, shall either be printed in the same order as the provisions are set forth
8 in those sections or, at the option of the health insurer, any such provision may
9 appear as a unit in any part of the policy, with other provisions to which it may
10 be logically related, provided the resulting policy shall not be in whole or in
11 part unintelligible, uncertain, ambiguous, abstruse, or likely to mislead a
12 person to whom the policy is offered, delivered, or issued.
13 § 4033. DISCRETIONARY CLAUSES PROHIBITED
14 (a) The purpose of this section is to ensure that health insurance benefits,
15 disability income protection coverage, and life insurance benefits are
16 contractually guaranteed and to avoid the conflict of interest that may occur

14 reserve discretion to the health insurer to interpret the terms of the contract or
15 to provide standards of interpretation or review that are inconsistent with the
16 laws of this State, and any such provision in a policy, contract, certificate, or
17 agreement shall be null and void.
18 (d) No policy, contract, certificate, or agreement offered or issued in this
19 State providing for disability income protection coverage may contain a

14 organized.
15 (b) Any policy of a domestic health insurer, when issued for delivery in any
16 other state or country, may contain any provision permitted or required by the
17 laws of such other state or country.

VT LEG #380165 v.1

2025 Page 47 of 181
1 (b) A policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State in

5 sections, the rights, duties, and obligations of the health insurer and the
6 covered individual shall be governed by the provisions of those sections.

15 copy of the application to the individual making the request within 15 days
16 after the receipt of the request. If the health insurer does not deliver or mail the

2 only, in a manner that indicates clearly that the insertions are not to be ascribed
3 to the applicant.
4 (c) The falsity of any statement in an application for a policy shall not bar
5 the right to recovery under the policy unless the false statement materially
6 affected either the acceptance of the risk or the hazard assumed by the health
7 insurer.
8 § 4038. RULEMAKING ON POLICY FILINGS
9 The Commissioner may adopt such reasonable rules concerning the
10 procedure for the filing or submission of policies subject to sections 4023 and
11 4028–4030 of this title as are necessary, proper, or advisable for the

10 Subchapter 6. Other Forms of Health Coverage
11 § 4051. MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE POLICIES
12 (a) Community rating.
13 (1) A health insurer shall use a community rating method acceptable to
14 the Commissioner for determining premiums for Medicare supplement
15 insurance policies.
16 (2) The Commissioner shall adopt rules for standards and procedure for
17 permitting health insurers that issue Medicare supplement insurance policies to
18 use one or more risk classifications in their community rating method. The
19 premium charged shall not deviate from the community rate and the rules shall
20 not permit medical underwriting and screening, except that a health insurer
VT LEG #380165 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.30
2025 Page 69 of 181
1 may set different community rates for persons eligible for Medicare by reason
2 of age and persons eligible for Medicare by reason of disability.
3 (b) Premium increases.
4 (1) Within five days after receiving a request for approval of any
5 composite average rate increase in excess of three percent, or any other
6 coverage changes that the Commissioner determines will have a comparable
7 impact on cost or availability of coverage for a Medicare supplement insurance
8 policy issued by any health insurer with 5,000 or more total lives in the
9 Vermont Medicare supplement insurance market, the Commissioner shall
10 notify the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent Living of the
11 proposed premium increase. A composite average rate is the enrollment-
12 weighted average rate increase of all plans offered by a health insurer.
13 (2) Within five days after receiving notification pursuant to subdivision
14 (1) of this subsection, the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent
15 Living shall inform the members of the Advisory Board established pursuant to
16 33 V.S.A. § 505 of the proposed premium increase.
17 (3)(A) The Commissioner shall not approve any request to increase
18 Medicare supplement insurance premium rates unless the amount of the rate
19 increase complies with the statutory standards for approval under sections
20 4026, 4513, 4584, and 5104 of this title. Any approved rate increase shall not
21 be based on an unreasonable change in loss ratio from the previous year, unless
VT LEG #380165 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.30
2025 Page 70 of 181
1 the Commissioner makes written findings that such change is necessary to
2 prevent a substantial adverse impact on the financial condition of the health
3 insurer. In acting on such rate increase requests, the Commissioner may deny
4 the request, approve the rate increase as requested, or approve a rate increase in
5 an amount different from the increase requested. A decision by the
6 Commissioner other than an approval of the rate requested may be appealed by
7 the health insurer, provided that the burden of proof shall be on the health
8 insurer to show that the approved rate does not meet the statutory standards
9 established under this subsection.
10 (B) Before acting on the rate increase requested, the Commissioner
11 may make such examination or investigation as the Commissioner deems
12 necessary, including where applicable the review process set forth in
13 subdivision (C) of this subdivision (3).
14 (C)(i) In reviewing any Medicare supplement insurance rate increase
15 for which an independent analysis has been performed pursuant to 33 V.S.A.
16 § 6706 and in which the health insurer’s requested composite average increase,
17 the independent expert’s recommended composite average rate increase, or the
18 Department actuary’s recommended composite average rate increase differ by
19 two percentage points or more, the Commissioner shall hold a public hearing at
20 which the health insurer, the Department’s actuary, the independent expert, any
21 intervenor, and the public will have the opportunity to present written and oral
VT LEG #380165 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.30
2025 Page 71 of 181
1 testimony and will be available to answer questions of the Commissioner and
2 those present.
3 (ii) The hearing shall be noticed and held at a time and place so as
4 to facilitate public participation, and shall be recorded and become part of the
5 record before the Commissioner. At the Commissioner’s discretion, the
6 hearing may be conducted remotely.
7 (iii) If the carrier’s requested composite average increase, the
8 independent expert’s recommended composite average increase, or the
9 Department actuary’s recommended composite average increase differs by less
10 than two percentage points, the Department and the parties shall confer by
11 conference call, or by any other available media, to review the rate requests
12 and recommendations. However, a public hearing may be held at the
13 Commissioner’s discretion for good cause shown.
14 (D)(i) In any review held in accordance with this subdivision (3), the
15 Commissioner shall permit intervention by any person whom the
16 Commissioner determines will materially advance the interests of the covered
17 individuals. The intervenor shall have access to and may use the information
18 of the independent expert appointed under 33 V.S.A. § 6706.
19 (ii) The reasonable and necessary cost of intervention as
20 determined by the Commissioner shall be paid by the affected policyholders or
21 certificate holders. The maximum payment shall be $2,500.00 except when
VT LEG #380165 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.30
2025 Page 72 of 181
1 waived by the Commissioner for good cause shown. The $2,500.00 maximum
2 amount may be adjusted to reflect, at the Commissioner’s discretion,
3 appropriate inflation factors.
4 (E) Nonproprietary, relevant information in any Medicare
5 supplement insurance rate filing, including any analysis by the Department’s
6 actuary and the independent expert, shall be made available to the public upon
7 request.
8 (c) Disability.
9 (1) A health insurer that issues Medicare supplement insurance policies
10 or certificates to a person eligible for Medicare by reason of age shall make
11 available, to persons eligible for Medicare by reason of disability, the same
12 policies or certificates that are offered and sold to persons eligible for
13 Medicare by reason of age. The initial enrollment period for any such policies
14 or certificates shall be at least six months following the date the individual
15 becomes eligible for Medicare by reason of disability. Any additional
16 enrollment periods as required by law and offered to individuals eligible by
17 reason of age shall be offered to individuals eligible by reason of disability.
18 (2) This subsection does not apply to persons eligible for Medicare by
19 reason of end stage renal disease.
20 (d) Outreach and education. The Department of Financial Regulation shall
21 collaborate with health insurers, advocates for older Vermonters and for other

5 networks.
6 § 4052. BLANKET HEALTH INSURANCE
7 (a) Blanket health insurance is a form of health insurance that, to the extent
8 permitted under federal law, is supplemental to major medical health insurance

13 be deemed the policyholder, covering a group defined as all persons who may
14 become passengers on such common carrier;

3 teachers, or both;
4 (4) under a policy or contract issued in the name of any volunteer fire
5 department, emergency medical services provider, or other such volunteer
6 group, which shall be deemed the policyholder, covering all of the members of
7 the department or group in connection with their department or group
8 activities; or
9 (5) under a policy or contract issued to any other substantially similar
10 group that, in the discretion of the Commissioner and after the prior approval
11 by the Commissioner of the group, may be subject to the issuance of a blanket
12 health policy or contract.
13 (b)(1) No blanket health insurance policy shall contain any provision
14 relating to notice of claim, proofs of loss, time of payment of claims, or time
15 within which legal action must be brought upon the policy that, in the opinion
16 of the Commissioner, is less favorable to the persons insured than would be
17 permitted by the provisions set forth in section 4029 of this title.
18 (2) An individual application shall not be required from a person
19 covered under a blanket health policy or contract, nor shall it be necessary for
20 the insurer to furnish each person a certificate.
VT LEG #380165 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.30
2025 Page 75 of 181
1 (3) All benefits under any blanket health policy shall, unless for hospital
2 and physician service or surgical benefits, be payable to the person insured, or
3 to the person’s designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to the person’s
4 estate, except that if the person insured is a minor, the benefits may be made
5 payable to the minor’s parent, guardian, or other person actually supporting the
6 minor.
7 (4) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the legal liability of
8 policyholders for the death of, or injury to, any members of the group.
9 (c) No blanket health insurance policy that provides coverage for the
10 payment of all or a portion of the cost of health care services or products shall
11 contain any provision that does not comply with a requirement of this title, or a
12 rule adopted pursuant to this title applicable to health insurance, other than
13 those requirements applicable to nongroup health insurance or small group
14 health insurance. The Commissioner may waive the application to a blanket
15 insurance policy of one or more of the health insurance requirements of this
16 title, or a rule adopted pursuant to this title, if the requirement is not relevant to
17 the types of risks and duration of risks insured against in the blanket insurance
18 policy.

3 months or less after the original effective date of the policy or contract.
4 (b) No person shall provide short-term, limited-duration health insurance
5 coverage without a certificate of authority from the Commissioner to offer
6 health insurance in this State unless the person is exempted by subdivision
7 3368(a)(4) of this title.
8 (c) A short-term, limited-duration health insurance policy or contract shall
9 be nonrenewable, and a health insurer shall not issue a short-term, limited-
10 duration health insurance policy or contract to any person if the issuance would
11 result in the person being covered by short-term, limited-duration health
12 insurance coverage for more than three months in any 12-month period.
13 (d) A policy or contract for short-term, limited-duration health insurance
14 coverage shall display prominently in the policy or contract and in any

16 in at least 14-point type, certain disclosures regarding the scope of short-term,
17 limited-duration health insurance coverage, including the types of benefits and
18 consumer protections that are and are not included. The Commissioner shall
19 determine the specific disclosure language that shall be used in all short-term,

10 diagnosed congenital defect or birth abnormality.
11 (2) Coverage for a newly born child shall be provided without notice or

15 notification of the birth of the newly born child and payment of the required
16 premium or fees be furnished to the health insurer within a period of not less
17 than 60 days after the date of birth.

8 (2) In any case in which a health insurance plan provides coverage for
9 dependent children of covered individuals, the plan shall provide benefits to
10 dependent children placed with covered individuals for adoption under the
11 same terms and conditions as apply to the natural, dependent children of the
12 covered individuals, irrespective of whether the adoption has become final.
13 (3) A health insurance plan shall not restrict coverage under the plan of
14 any dependent child adopted by a covered individual, or placed with a covered
15 individual for adoption, solely on the basis of a preexisting condition of the
16 child at the time that the child would otherwise become eligible for coverage
17 under the plan, if the adoption or placement for adoption occurs while the
18 covered individual is eligible for coverage under the plan.
19 (d) Coverage required until 26 years of age. A health insurance plan that
20 provides dependent coverage of children shall continue to make that coverage

6 services of the originating site health care provider or of the distant site health
7 care provider, but not both.
