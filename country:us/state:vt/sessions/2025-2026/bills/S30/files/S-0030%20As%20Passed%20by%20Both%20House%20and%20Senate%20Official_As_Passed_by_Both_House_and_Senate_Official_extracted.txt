15 the Board shall:
16 (1) conduct a public hearing, at which the Board shall:

7 (2) The policy forms for major medical insurance coverage, as well as
8 the policy forms, premium rates, and rules for the classification of risk for the
9 other lines of insurance described in subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be
10 reviewed and approved or disapproved by the Commissioner. In making a
11 determination, the Commissioner shall consider whether a policy form,

20 unless prior to then it has been affirmatively approved or disapproved by the
21 Commissioner or found to be incomplete. The Commissioner shall notify a
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 24 of 182
1 health insurer in writing if the insurer files any form, premium rate, or rule
2 containing a provision that does not meet the standards expressed in this

4 granted within 20 days upon the insurer’s written request.
5 (i) Notwithstanding the procedures and timelines set forth in subsections
6 (a) through (e) of this section, the Board may establish, by rule, a streamlined
7 rate review process for certain rate decisions, including proposed rates
8 affecting fewer than a minimum number of covered lives and proposed rates
9 for which a de minimis increase, as defined by the Board by rule, is sought.
10 § 4027. FILING FEES
11 Each filing of a policy, contract, or document form or premium rates or
12 rules, submitted pursuant to section 4026 of this title, shall be accompanied by
13 payment to the Commissioner or the Green Mountain Care Board, as
14 appropriate, of a nonrefundable fee of $150.00.

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 25 of 182
1 (2) The policy sets forth the time at which the insurance takes effect and
2 terminates.
3 (3) The policy purports to insure only one person, except that a policy

13 and not less than 10-point with a lowercase unspaced alphabet length not less
14 than 120-point. As used in this subdivision, the “text” includes all printed
15 matter except the name and address of the insurer; the name or title of the

8 of the policy unless that portion is set forth in full in the policy, except in the
9 case of the incorporation of, or reference to, a statement of rates or
10 classification of risks or a short-rate table filed with the Commissioner.
11 (8) Either prominently printed on or attached to the first page of the
12 policy is a notice to the effect that during a period of 30 days following the

15 be surrendered to the insurer together with a written request for cancellation of
16 the policy, and that in such event, the insurer will refund any premium paid,
17 including any policy fees or other charges; provided, however, that this
18 subdivision shall not apply to single premium nonrenewable policies insuring
19 against accident only or medical costs or accidental bodily injury only.

2 Except as provided in section 4031 of this title, each health insurance policy
3 delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State shall contain the
4 provisions specified in this section using the language set forth in this section;
5 provided, however, that a health insurer may, at its option, substitute different
6 language approved by the Commissioner for one or more provisions, provided
7 the substituted language is not less favorable in any respect to the insured or
8 covered individual than the language used in this section. The provisions
9 specified in this section shall be preceded individually by the caption
10 appearing in this section or, at the option of the health insurer, by such
11 appropriate captions or subcaptions as the Commissioner may approve:
12 (1) ENTIRE CONTRACT; CHANGES: This policy, including the
13 endorsements and the attached papers, if any, constitutes the entire contract of
14 insurance. No change in this policy shall be valid until approved by an
15 executive officer of the insurer and unless such approval be endorsed hereon or
16 attached hereto. No agent has authority to change this policy or to waive any
17 of its provisions.
18 (2) TIME LIMIT ON CERTAIN DEFENSES: (a) After three years
19 from the date of issue of this policy no misstatements, except fraudulent
20 misstatements, made by the applicant in the application for such policy, shall
21 be used to void the policy or to deny a claim for loss incurred or disability (as
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 28 of 182
1 defined in the policy) commencing after the expiration of such three year
2 period.
3 After this policy has been in force for a period of three years during the
4 lifetime of the insured (excluding any period during which the insured is
5 disabled), it shall become incontestable as to the statements contained in the
6 application.)
7 (b) No claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy)
8 commencing after three years from the date of issue of this policy shall be
9 reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition not
10 excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective on the date
11 of loss had existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this policy.
(2) TIME LIMIT ON CERTAIN DEFENSES: (a) After three years from
the date of issue of this policy no misstatements, except fraudulent
misstatements, made by the applicant in the application for such policy, shall
be used to void the policy or to deny a claim for loss incurred or disability (as
defined in the policy) commencing after the expiration of such three-year
period.
(The foregoing policy provision shall not be so construed as to affect any
legal requirement for avoidance of a policy or denial of a claim during such
initial three-year period, nor to limit the application of subdivisions 4030(1)–
(5) of this title in the event of misstatement with respect to age or occupation
or other insurance.) (A policy which the insured has the right to continue in
force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premium (1) until at least
age 50, or (2) in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years
from its date of issue, may contain in lieu of the foregoing the following
provision (from which the clause in parentheses may be omitted at the insurer’s
option) under the caption “INCONTESTABLE”:
After this policy has been in force for a period of three years during the
lifetime of the insured (excluding any period during which the insured is
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 29 of 182
disabled), it shall become incontestable as to the statements contained in the
application.)
(b) No claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy)
commencing after three years from the date of issue of this policy shall be
reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition not
excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective on the date of
loss had existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this policy.
1 (3) GRACE PERIOD: A grace period of . . . . (insert a number not less
2 than “7” for weekly premium policies, “10” for monthly premium policies and
3 “31” for all other policies) days will be granted for the payment of each
4 premium falling due after the first premium, during which grace period the
5 policy shall continue in force.
6 (A policy which contains a cancellation provision may add, at the end of
7 the above provision,
8 subject to the right of the insurer to cancel in accordance with the
9 cancellation provision hereof,
10 A policy in which the insurer reserves the right to refuse any renewal
11 shall have, at the beginning of the above provision,
12 Unless not less than five days prior to the premium due date the insurer has
13 delivered to the insured or has mailed to his or her last address as shown by the
14 records of the insurer written notice of its intention not to renew this policy
15 beyond the period for which the premium has been accepted.)
16 (4) REINSTATEMENT: If any renewal premium be not paid within the
17 time granted the insured for payment, a subsequent acceptance of premium by
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 30 of 182
1 the insurer or by any agent duly authorized by the insurer to accept such
2 premium, without requiring in connection therewith an application for
3 reinstatement, shall reinstate the policy; provided, however, that if the insurer
4 or such agent requires an application for reinstatement and issues a conditional
5 receipt for the premium tendered, the policy will be reinstated upon approval
6 of such application by the insurer or, lacking such approval, upon the 45th day
7 following the date of such conditional receipt unless the insurer has previously
8 notified the insured in writing of its disapproval of such application. The
9 reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from such accidental injury as
10 may be sustained after the date of reinstatement and loss due to such sickness
11 as may begin more than ten days after such date. In all other respects the
12 insured and insurer shall have the same rights thereunder as they had under the
13 policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to
14 any provisions endorsed hereon or attached hereto in connection with the
15 reinstatement. Any premium accepted in connection with a reinstatement shall
16 be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not
17 to any period more than sixty days prior to the date of reinstatement.
18 (The last sentence of the above provision may be omitted from any
19 policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms
20 by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50, or (2) in the case
21 of a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue.)
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 31 of 182
1 (5) NOTICE OF CLAIM: Written notice of claim must be given to the
2 insurer within 20 days after the occurrence or commencement of any loss
3 covered by the policy, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible. Notice
4 given by or on behalf of the insured or the beneficiary to the insurer at . . . .
5 (insert the location of such office as the insurer may designate for the
6 purpose), or to any authorized agent of the insurer, with information sufficient
7 to identify the insured, shall be deemed notice to the insurer.
8 (In a policy providing a loss-of-time benefit which may be payable for at
9 least two years, an insurer may at its option insert the following between the
10 first and second sentences of the above provision:
11 Subject to the qualifications set forth below, if the insured suffers loss of
12 time on account of disability for which indemnity may be payable for at least
13 two years, he or she shall, at least once in every sixmonths after having given
14 notice of claim, give to the insurer notice of continuance of said disability,
15 except in the event of legal incapacity. The period of sixmonths following
16 any filing of proof by the insured or any payment by the insurer on account of
17 such claim or any denial of liability in whole or in part by the insurer shall be
18 excluded in applying this provision. Delay in the giving of such notice shall
19 not impair the insured’s right to any indemnity which would otherwise have
20 accrued during the period of sixmonths preceding the date on which such
21 notice is actually given.)
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 32 of 182
1 (6) CLAIM FORMS: The insurer, upon receipt of a notice of claim, will
2 furnish to the claimant such forms as are usually furnished by it for filing
3 proofs of loss. If such forms are not furnished within 15 days after the giving
4 of such notice the claimant shall be deemed to have complied with the
5 requirements of this policy as to proof of loss upon submitting, within the time
6 fixed in the policy for filing proofs of loss, written proof covering the
7 occurrence, the character and the extent of the loss for which claim is made.
8 (7) PROOFS OF LOSS: Written proof of loss must be furnished to the
9 insurer at its said office in case of claim for loss for which this policy provides
10 any periodic payment contingent upon continuing loss within 90 days after the
11 termination of the period for which the insurer is liable and in case of claim for
12 any other loss within 90 days after the date of such loss. Failure to furnish
13 such proof within the time required shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if
14 it was not reasonably possible to give proof within such time, provided such
15 proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the
16 absence of legal capacity, later than one year from the time proof is otherwise
17 required.
18 (8) TIME OF PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Indemnities payable under this
19 policy for any loss other than loss for which this policy provides any periodic
20 payment will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof of such
21 loss. Subject to due written proof of loss, all accrued indemnities for loss for
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 33 of 182
1 which this policy provides periodic payment will be paid . . . . (insert period
2 for payment which must not be less frequently than monthly) and any balance
3 remaining unpaid upon the termination of liability will be paid immediately
4 upon receipt of due written proof.
5 (9) PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Indemnity for loss of life will be payable in
6 accordance with the beneficiary designation and the provisions respecting such
7 payment which may be prescribed herein and effective at the time of payment.
8 If no such designation or provision is then effective, such indemnity shall be
9 payable to the estate of the insured. Any other accrued indemnities unpaid at
10 the insured’s death may, at the option of the insurer, be paid either to such
11 beneficiary or to such estate. All other indemnities will be payable to the
12 insured.
13 (The following provisions, or either of them, may be included with the
14 foregoing provision at the option of the insurer:
15 If any indemnity of this policy shall be payable to the estate of the insured,
16 or to an insured or beneficiary who is a minor or otherwise not competent to
17 give a valid release, the insurer may pay such indemnity, up to an amount not
18 exceeding $. . . . . . (insert an amount which shall not exceed $1,000.00), to
19 any relative by blood or connection by civil marriage of the insured or
20 beneficiary who is deemed by the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto. Any
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 34 of 182
1 payment made by the insurer in good faith pursuant to this provision shall
2 fully discharge the insurer to the extent of such payment.
3 Subject to any written direction of the insured in the application or
4 otherwise all or a portion of any indemnities provided by this policy on
5 account of hospital, nursing, medical, or surgical services may, at the insurer’s
6 option and unless the insured requests otherwise in writing not later than the
7 time of filing proofs of such loss, be paid directly to the hospital or person
8 rendering such services; but it is not required that the service be rendered by a
9 particular hospital or person.)
10 (10) PHYSICALEXAMINATIONS AND AUTOPSY: The insurer at its
11 own expense shall have the right and the opportunity to examine the person of
12 the insured when and as often as it may reasonably require during the
13 pendency of a claim hereunder and to make an autopsy in case of death where
14 it is not forbidden by law.
15 (11) LEGALACTIONS: No action at law or in equity shall be brought to
16 recover on this policy prior to the expiration of 60 days after written proof of
17 loss has been furnished in accordance with the requirements of this policy. No
18 such action shall be brought after the expiration of three years after the time
19 written proof of loss is required to be furnished.
20 (12) CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY: Unless the insured makes an
21 irrevocable designation of beneficiary, the right to change of beneficiary is
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 35 of 182
1 reserved to the insured and the consent of the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall
2 not be requisite to surrender or assignment of this policy or to any change of
3 beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to any other changes in this policy.
4 (The first clause of this provision, relative to the irrevocable designation
5 of beneficiary, may be omitted at the insurer’s option.)
6 § 4030. OPTIONALSTANDARD POLICY PROVISIONS
7 Except as provided in section 4031 of this title, no health insurance policy
8 delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State shall contain
9 provisions respecting the matters set forth in this section unless the provisions
10 use the language set forth in this section; provided, however, that a health
11 insurer may, at its option, substitute different language approved by the
12 Commissioner for one or more provisions, provided the substituted language is
13 not less favorable in any respect to the insured or covered individual than the
14 language used in this section. Any provision set forth in this section that is
15 contained in the policy shall be preceded individually by the appropriate
16 caption appearing in this section or, at the option of the health insurer, by such
17 appropriate captions or subcaptions as the Commissioner may approve:
18 (1) CHANGE OF OCCUPATION: If the insured be injured or contract
19 sickness after having changed his or her occupation to one classified by the
20 insurer as more hazardous than that stated in this policy or while doing for
21 compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so classified, the insurer
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 36 of 182
1 will pay only such portion of the indemnities provided in this policy as the
2 premium paid would have purchased at the rates and within the limits fixed by
3 the insurer for such more hazardous occupation. If the insured changes his or
4 her occupation to one classified by the insurer as less hazardous than that
5 stated in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of such change of
6 occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly, and will return the
7 excess pro rata unearned premium from the date of change of occupation or
8 from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of such proof,
9 whichever is the more recent. In applying this provision, the classification of
10 occupational risk and the premium rates shall be such as have been last filed
11 by the insurer prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable
12 or prior to date of proof of change in occupation with the state official having
13 supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided at the time this
14 policy was issued; but if such filing was not required, then the classification of
15 occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by
16 the insurer in such state prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the date
17 of proof of change in occupation.
18 (2) MISSTATEMENT OF AGE: If the age of the insured has been
19 misstated, all amounts payable under this policy shall be such as the premium
20 paid would have purchased at the correct age.
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 37 of 182
1 (3) OTHER INSURANCE IN THIS INSURER: If an accident or
2 sickness or accident and sickness policy or policies previously issued by the
3 insurer to the insured be in force concurrently herewith, making the aggregate
4 indemnity for .... (insert type of coverage or coverages) in excess of $
5 .................... (insert maximum limit of indemnity or indemnities) the excess
6 insurance shall be void and all premiums paid for such excess shall be returned
7 to the insured or to his or her estate.
or, in lieu thereof:
8 Insurance effective at any one time on the insured under a like policy or
9 policies in this insurer is limited to the one such policy elected by the insured,
10 his or her beneficiary or his or her estate, as the case may be, and the insurer
11 will return all premiums paid for all other such policies.
12 (4) INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS: If there be other valid
13 coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a
14 provision of service basis or on an expense incurred basis and of which this
15 insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or
16 commencement of loss, the only liability under any expense incurred coverage
17 of this policy shall be for such proportion of the loss as the amount which
18 would otherwise have been payable hereunder plus the total of the like
19 amounts under all such other valid coverages for the same loss of which this
20 insurer had notice bears to the total like amounts under all valid coverages for
21 such loss, and for the return of such portion of the premiums paid as shall
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 38 of 182
1 exceed the pro rata portion for the amount so determined. For the purpose of
2 applying this provision when other coverage is on a provision of service basis,
3 the “like amount” of such other coverage shall be taken as the amount which
4 the services rendered would have cost in the absence of such coverage.
5 (If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also
6 contains the next following policy provision there shall be added to the caption
7 of the foregoing provision the phrase “—EXPENSE INCURRED
8 BENEFITS.” The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a
9 definition of “other valid coverage,” approved as to form by the
10 Commissioner, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage
11 provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by
12 insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any
13 province of Canada, and by hospital or medical service organizations, and to
14 any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the
15 Commissioner. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include
16 group insurance, automobile medical payments insurance, or coverage
17 provided by hospital or medical service organizations or by union welfare
18 plans or employer or employee benefit organizations. For the purpose of
19 applying the foregoing policy provision with respect to any insured, any
20 amount of benefit provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory
21 benefit statute (including any workers’ compensation or employer’s liability
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 39 of 182
1 statute) whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise shall in all
2 cases be deemed to be “other valid coverage” of which the insurer has had
3 notice. In applying the foregoing policy provision no third party liability
4 coverage shall be included as “other valid coverage.”)
5 (5) INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS: If there be other valid
6 coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on other
7 than an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given
8 written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only
9 liability for such benefits under this policy shall be for such proportion of the
10 indemnities otherwise provided hereunder for such loss as the like indemnities
11 of which the insurer had notice (including the indemnities under this policy)
12 bear to the total amount of all like indemnities for such loss, and for the return
13 of such portion of the premium paid as shall exceed the pro rata portion for the
14 indemnities thus determined.
15 (If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also
16 contains the next preceding policy provision there shall be added to the caption
17 of the foregoing provision the phrase “—OTHER BENEFITS.” The insurer
18 may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “other valid
19 coverage,” approved as to form by the Commissioner, which definition shall
20 be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to
21 regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other

1 state of the United States or any province of Canada, and to any other coverage
2 the inclusion of which may be approved by the Commissioner. In the absence
3 of such definition such term shall not include group insurance, or benefits
4 provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit
5 organizations. For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy provision with
6 respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such insured
7 pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers’
8 compensation or employer’s liability statute) whether provided by a
9 governmental agency or otherwise shall in all cases be deemed to be “other
10 valid coverage” of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing
11 policy provision no third party liability coverage shall be included as “other
12 valid coverage.”)
13 (6) RELATION OF EARNINGS TO INSURANCE: If the total monthly
14 amount of loss of time benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss
15 of time coverage upon the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly
16 basis, shall exceed the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability
17 commenced or his or her average monthly earnings for the period of two years
18 immediately preceding a disability for which claim is made, whichever is the
19 greater, the insurer will be liable only for such proportionate amount of such
20 benefits under this policy as the amount of such monthly earnings or such
21 average monthly earnings of the insured bears to the total amount of monthly
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 41 of 182
1 benefits for the same loss under all such coverage upon the insured at the time
2 such disability commences and for the return of such part of the premiums
3 paid during such two years as shall exceed the pro rata amount of the
4 premiums for the benefits actually paid hereunder; but this shall not operate to
5 reduce the total monthly amount of benefits payable under all such coverage
6 upon the insured below the sum of $200.00 or the sum of the monthly benefits
7 specified in such coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to
8 reduce benefits other than those payable for loss of time.
9 (The foregoing policy provision may be inserted only in a policy which
10 the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely
11 payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50; or (2) in the case of a policy
12 issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue. The insurer
13 may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “valid loss of time
14 coverage,” approved as to form by the Commissioner, which definition shall
15 be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by governmental agencies or
16 by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance
17 authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of
18 Canada, or to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by
19 the Commissioner or any combination of such coverages. In the absence of
20 such definition such term shall not include any coverage provided for such
21 insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers’
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 42 of 182
1 compensation or employer’s liability statute), or benefits provided by union
2 welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations.)
3 (7) UNPAID PREMIUM: Upon the payment of a claim under this policy,
4 any premium then due and unpaid or covered by any note or written order may
5 be deducted therefrom.
6 (8) CANCELLATION: The insurer may cancel this policy at any time by
7 written notice delivered to the insured, or mailed to his or her last address as
8 shown by the records of the insurer, stating when, not less than five days
9 thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective; and after the policy has been
10 continued beyond its original term the insured may cancel this policy at any
11 time by written notice delivered or mailed to the insurer, effective upon receipt
12 or on such later date as may be specified in such notice. In the event of
13 cancellation, the insurer will return promptly the unearned portion of any
14 premium paid. If the insured cancels, the earned premium shall be computed
15 by the use of the short-rate table last filed with the state official having
16 supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided when the policy
17 was issued. If the insurer cancels, the earned premium shall be computed pro
18 rata. Cancellation shall be without prejudice to any claim originating prior to
19 the effective date of cancellation.
20 (9) CONFORMITY WITH STATE STATUTES: Any provision of this
21 policy which, on its effective date, is in conflict with the statutes of the state in
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 43 of 182
1 which the insured resides on such date is hereby amended to conform to the
2 minimum requirements of such statutes.
3 (10) ILLEGALOCCUPATION: The insurer shall not be liable for any loss
4 to which a contributing cause was the insured’s commission of or attempt to
5 commit a felony or to which a contributing cause was the insured’s being
6 engaged in an illegal occupation.
7 § 4031. OMISSION OF INAPPLICABLE OR INCONSISTENT
8 STANDARD PROVISIONS
9 If any provision of sections 4029 and 4030 of this title is in whole or in part
10 inapplicable to or inconsistent with the coverage provided by a particular form
11 of policy, the health insurer, with the approval of the Commissioner, shall omit
12 from such policy any inapplicable provision or part of a provision, and shall
13 modify any inconsistent provision or part of the provision in such manner as to
14 make the provision as contained in the policy consistent with the coverage
15 provided by the policy.
16 § 4032. ORDER OF STANDARD POLICY PROVISIONS
17 The provisions specified in sections 4029 and 4030 of this title, or any
18 corresponding provisions used in lieu of those provisions as permitted by those
19 sections, shall either be printed in the same order as the provisions are set forth
20 in those sections or, at the option of the health insurer, any such provision may
21 appear as a unit in any part of the policy, with other provisions to which it may
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 44 of 182
1 be logically related, provided the resulting policy shall not be in whole or in
2 part unintelligible, uncertain, ambiguous, abstruse, or likely to mislead a
3 person to whom the policy is offered, delivered, or issued.
4 § 4033. DISCRETIONARY CLAUSES PROHIBITED
5 (a) The purpose of this section is to ensure that health insurance benefits,
6 disability income protection coverage, and life insurance benefits are
7 contractually guaranteed and to avoid the conflict of interest that may occur
8 when the carrier responsible for providing benefits has discretionary authority
9 to decide what benefits are due. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
10 impose any requirement or duty on any person other than a health insurer or a
11 health insurer offering disability income protection coverage or life insurance.
12 (b) As used in this section:
13 (1) “Disability income protection coverage” means a policy, contract,
14 certificate, or agreement that provides for weekly, monthly, or other periodic
15 payments for a specified period during the continuance of disability resulting
16 from illness, injury, or a combination of illness and injury.
17 (2) “Health insurer” has the same meaning as in section 4021 of this
18 chapter and, as used in this section, also includes entities offering policies for
19 specific disease, accident, injury, hospital indemnity, dental care, disability
20 income, long-term care, and other limited benefit coverage.

3 (c) No policy, contract, certificate, or agreement offered or issued in this
4 State by a health insurer to provide, deliver, arrange for, pay for, or reimburse
5 any of the costs of health care services may contain a provision purporting to
6 reserve discretion to the health insurer to interpret the terms of the contract or
7 to provide standards of interpretation or review that are inconsistent with the
8 laws of this State, and any such provision in a policy, contract, certificate, or
9 agreement shall be null and void.
10 (d) No policy, contract, certificate, or agreement offered or issued in this
11 State providing for disability income protection coverage may contain a
12 provision purporting to reserve discretion to the insurer to interpret the terms
13 of the contract or to provide standards of interpretation or review that are
14 inconsistent with the laws of this State, and any such provision in a policy,
15 contract, certificate, or agreement shall be null and void.
16 (e) No policy, contract, certificate, or agreement of life insurance offered
17 or issued in this State shall contain a provision purporting to reserve discretion
18 to the insurer to interpret the terms of the contract or to provide standards of
19 interpretation or review that are inconsistent with the laws of this State, and
20 any such provision in a policy, contract, certificate, or agreement shall be null
21 and void.

3 delivery to any person in this State, may contain any provision that is not less
4 favorable to the covered individual than the provisions of this chapter and that
5 is prescribed or required by the law of the state under which the insurer is
6 organized.
7 (b) Any policy of a domestic health insurer, when issued for delivery in
8 any other state or country, may contain any provision permitted or required by
9 the laws of such other state or country.
10 § 4035. POLICIES NOT AFFECTED
11 Nothing in sections 4018–4020, 4023, 4028–4032, 4034, 4036, and 4037 of
12 this title shall apply to or affect:
13 (1) any policy of workers’ compensation insurance or any policy of
14 liability insurance, with or without supplementary coverage;
15 (2) any policy or contract of reinsurance;

1 (A) provide additional benefits in case of death or dismemberment or
2 loss of sight by accident; or
3 (B) operate to safeguard the contracts against lapse or to give a
4 special surrender value or special benefit or an annuity in the event that the

8 (a) A health insurance policy shall not contain any provision that makes the
9 policy or any portion of the policy less favorable in any respect to the covered
10 individual than the provisions of the policy that are regulated by sections 4029
11 and 4030 of this title.
12 (b) A policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State in
13 violation of sections 4029 and 4030 of this title shall be held valid but shall be
14 construed as provided in this chapter. When any provision in a policy
15 regulated by sections 4029 and 4030 is in conflict with any provision of those
16 sections, the rights, duties, and obligations of the health insurer and the
17 covered individual shall be governed by the provisions of those sections.
18 § 4037. APPLICATIONS FOR INSURANCE
19 (a)(1) A covered individual shall not be bound by any statement made in
20 an application for a policy unless a copy of the application is attached to or
21 endorsed on the policy as a part of the policy when issued.
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 48 of 182

4 any, for such reinstatement or renewal, the health insurer shall deliver or mail
5 a copy of the application to the individual making the request within 15 days
6 after the receipt of the request. If the health insurer does not deliver or mail
7 the copy within 15 days, the health insurer shall be precluded from introducing
8 the application as evidence in any action or proceeding based on or involving
9 the policy or its reinstatement or renewal.
10 (b) No alteration of a written application for a policy shall be made by any
11 person other than the applicant without the applicant’s written consent, except
12 that insertions may be made by the health insurer, for administrative purposes
13 only, in a manner that indicates clearly that the insertions are not to be ascribed
14 to the applicant.
15 (c) The falsity of any statement in an application for a policy shall not bar
16 the right to recovery under the policy unless the false statement materially
17 affected either the acceptance of the risk or the hazard assumed by the health
18 insurer.
19 § 4038. RULEMAKING ON POLICY FILINGS
20 The Commissioner may adopt such reasonable rules concerning the
21 procedure for the filing or submission of policies subject to sections 4023 and

2025 Page 49 of 182
1 4028–4030 of this title as are necessary, proper, or advisable for the

1 (a) Terms and conditions. No group health insurance policy shall contain
2 any provision relating to notice of claim, proofs of loss, time of payment of

6 In addition, each such policy shall contain in substance the following
7 provisions:
8 (1) A provision that the policy; the application of the policyholder, if an
9 application or copy is attached to the policy; and the individual applications, if
10 any, submitted by the employees or members in connection with the policy
11 shall constitute the entire contract between the parties, and that all statements,
12 in the absence of fraud, made by any applicant or applicants shall be deemed

8 insurer shall offer to include the part-time employees as part of the employer’s
9 employee group, at the full rate to be paid by the employer and the employee,

4 (B)(i) In the event that the federal government does not establish an
5 annual limitation on cost sharing for any plan year, the annual limitation on
6 cost sharing for self-only coverage for that year shall be the dollar limit for

8 by which the average per capita premium for health insurance coverage in
9 Vermont for the preceding calendar year exceeds the average per capita
10 premium for the year before that.

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 69 of 182
1 (1) A health insurer shall use a community rating method acceptable to
2 the Commissioner for determining premiums for Medicare supplement
3 insurance policies.
4 (2) The Commissioner shall adopt rules for standards and procedure for
5 permitting health insurers that issue Medicare supplement insurance policies to
6 use one or more risk classifications in their community rating method. The
7 premium charged shall not deviate from the community rate and the rules shall
8 not permit medical underwriting and screening, except that a health insurer
9 may set different community rates for persons eligible for Medicare by reason
10 of age and persons eligible for Medicare by reason of disability.
11 (b) Premium increases.
12 (1) Within five days after receiving a request for approval of any
13 composite average rate increase in excess of three percent, or any other
14 coverage changes that the Commissioner determines will have a comparable
15 impact on cost or availability of coverage for a Medicare supplement insurance
16 policy issued by any health insurer with 5,000 or more total lives in the
17 Vermont Medicare supplement insurance market, the Commissioner shall
18 notify the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent Living of the
19 proposed premium increase. A composite average rate is the enrollment-

2 (1) of this subsection, the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent
3 Living shall inform the members of the Advisory Board established pursuant
4 to 33 V.S.A. § 505 of the proposed premium increase.
5 (3)(A) The Commissioner shall not approve any request to increase
6 Medicare supplement insurance premium rates unless the amount of the rate
7 increase complies with the statutory standards for approval under sections
8 4026, 4513, 4584, and 5104 of this title. Any approved rate increase shall not
9 be based on an unreasonable change in loss ratio from the previous year, unless
10 the Commissioner makes written findings that such change is necessary to
11 prevent a substantial adverse impact on the financial condition of the health
12 insurer. In acting on such rate increase requests, the Commissioner may deny
13 the request, approve the rate increase as requested, or approve a rate increase
14 in an amount different from the increase requested. A decision by the
15 Commissioner other than an approval of the rate requested may be appealed by
16 the health insurer, provided that the burden of proof shall be on the health
17 insurer to show that the approved rate does not meet the statutory standards
18 established under this subsection.
19 (B) Before acting on the rate increase requested, the Commissioner
20 may make such examination or investigation as the Commissioner deems
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 71 of 182
1 necessary, including where applicable the review process set forth in
2 subdivision (C) of this subdivision (3).
3 (C)(i) In reviewing any Medicare supplement insurance rate increase
4 for which an independent analysis has been performed pursuant to 33 V.S.A.
5 § 6706 and in which the health insurer’s requested composite average increase,
6 the independent expert’s recommended composite average rate increase, or the
7 Department actuary’s recommended composite average rate increase differ by
8 two percentage points or more, the Commissioner shall hold a public hearing
9 at which the health insurer, the Department’s actuary, the independent expert,
10 any intervenor, and the public will have the opportunity to present written and
11 oral testimony and will be available to answer questions of the Commissioner
12 and those present.
13 (ii) The hearing shall be noticed and held at a time and place so as
14 to facilitate public participation, and shall be recorded and become part of the
15 record before the Commissioner. At the Commissioner’s discretion, the
16 hearing may be conducted remotely.
17 (iii) If the carrier’s requested composite average increase, the
18 independent expert’s recommended composite average increase, or the
19 Department actuary’s recommended composite average increase differs by less
20 than two percentage points, the Department and the parties shall confer by
21 conference call, or by any other available media, to review the rate requests
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 72 of 182
1 and recommendations. However, a public hearing may be held at the
2 Commissioner’s discretion for good cause shown.
3 (D)(i) In any review held in accordance with this subdivision (3), the
4 Commissioner shall permit intervention by any person whom the
5 Commissioner determines will materially advance the interests of the covered
6 individuals. The intervenor shall have access to and may use the information
7 of the independent expert appointed under 33 V.S.A. § 6706.
8 (ii) The reasonable and necessary cost of intervention as
9 determined by the Commissioner shall be paid by the affected policyholders or
10 certificate holders. The maximum payment shall be $2,500.00 except when
11 waived by the Commissioner for good cause shown. The $2,500.00 maximum
12 amount may be adjusted to reflect, at the Commissioner’s discretion,
13 appropriate inflation factors.
14 (E) Nonproprietary, relevant information in any Medicare
15 supplement insurance rate filing, including any analysis by the Department’s
16 actuary and the independent expert, shall be made available to the public upon
17 request.
18 (c) Disability.
19 (1) A health insurer that issues Medicare supplement insurance policies
20 or certificates to a person eligible for Medicare by reason of age shall make
21 available, to persons eligible for Medicare by reason of disability, the same
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 73 of 182
1 policies or certificates that are offered and sold to persons eligible for
2 Medicare by reason of age. The initial enrollment period for any such policies
3 or certificates shall be at least sixmonths following the date the individual
4 becomes eligible for Medicare by reason of disability. Any additional
5 enrollment periods as required by law and offered to individuals eligible by
6 reason of age shall be offered to individuals eligible by reason of disability.
7 (2) This subsection does not apply to persons eligible for Medicare by
8 reason of end stage renal disease.
9 (d) Outreach and education. The Department of Financial Regulation shall
10 collaborate with health insurers, advocates for older Vermonters and for other
11 Medicare-eligible adults, and the Office of the Health Care Advocate to
12 educate the public about the benefits and limitations of Medicare supplement
13 insurance policies and Medicare Advantage plans, including information to
14 help the public understand issues relating to coverage, costs, and provider
15 networks.

18 activities; or
19 (5) under a policy or contract issued to any other substantially similar
20 group that, in the discretion of the Commissioner and after the prior approval
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 75 of 182
1 by the Commissioner of the group, may be subject to the issuance of a blanket
2 health policy or contract.
3 (b)(1) No blanket health insurance policy shall contain any provision
4 relating to notice of claim, proofs of loss, time of payment of claims, or time
5 within which legal action must be brought upon the policy that, in the opinion
6 of the Commissioner, is less favorable to the persons insured than would be
7 permitted by the provisions set forth in section 4029 of this title.
8 (2) An individual application shall not be required from a person
9 covered under a blanket health policy or contract, nor shall it be necessary for
10 the insurer to furnish each person a certificate.
11 (3) All benefits under any blanket health policy shall, unless for hospital
12 and physician service or surgical benefits, be payable to the person insured, or
13 to the person’s designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to the person’s
14 estate, except that if the person insured is a minor, the benefits may be made
15 payable to the minor’s parent, guardian, or other person actually supporting
16 the minor.
17 (4) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the legal liability of
18 policyholders for the death of, or injury to, any members of the group.
19 (c) No blanket health insurance policy that provides coverage for the

2025 Page 76 of 182
1 a rule adopted pursuant to this title applicable to health insurance, other than
2 those requirements applicable to nongroup health insurance or small group
3 health insurance. The Commissioner may waive the application to a blanket
4 insurance policy of one or more of the health insurance requirements of this

1 would result in the person being covered by short-term, limited-duration health
2 insurance coverage for more than three months in any 12-month period.
3 (d) A policy or contract for short-term, limited-duration health insurance
4 coverage shall display prominently in the policy or contract and in any

6 in at least 14-point type, certain disclosures regarding the scope of short-term,
7 limited-duration health insurance coverage, including the types of benefits and
8 consumer protections that are and are not included. The Commissioner shall

18 dependent children of covered individuals, the plan shall provide benefits to
19 dependent children placed with covered individuals for adoption under the
20 same terms and conditions as apply to the natural, dependent children of the
21 covered individuals, irrespective of whether the adoption has become final.

2025 Page 80 of 182
1 (3) A health insurance plan shall not restrict coverage under the plan of
2 any dependent child adopted by a covered individual, or placed with a covered
3 individual for adoption, solely on the basis of a preexisting condition of the

7 services be provided by a licensed naturopathic physician under contract with

7 reasonable deductibles, co-payment and co-insurance amounts, fee or benefit
8 limits, practice parameters, and utilization review consistent with applicable

15 treatment modalities among different types of health care professionals.
16 (c) A health insurer may require that the athletic trainer services be
17 provided by a licensed athletic trainer under contract with the insurer.

17 be seized, taken, appropriated, or applied by any legal or equitable process or
18 by operation of law, either before or after payment of such benefits, to pay any
19 debt or liabilities of the person insured under the policy. However, this

2025 Page 7 of 182
1 contains a statement to that effect. When a policy provides for a lump sum
2 payment because of a dismemberment or other loss insured, the payment shall
3 be exempt from execution of the covered individual’s creditors.
4 § 4018. THIRD-PARTY OWNERSHIP
5 Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as preventing a person other than

8 under such a policy to any indemnities, benefits, and rights provided in the
9 policy.

14 forms for filing proof of loss under the plan, or investigating any claim of loss
15 under the plan.
16 § 4020. AGE LIMITS
17 (a) If a health insurance plan contains a provision establishing, as an age
18 limit or otherwise, a date after which the coverage provided by the plan will
19 not be effective, and if that date falls within a period for which the health
20 insurer has accepted a premium or if the health insurer accepts a premium after
21 that date, the coverage provided by the plan shall continue in force subject to

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30

1 any right of cancellation until the end of the period for which a premium has

7 the health insurer’s acceptance of the premium or premiums, then the health
8 insurer’s liability shall be limited to the refund, upon request, of all premiums
9 paid for the period not covered by the plan.
10 § 4021. TERMINATION OF COVERAGE
11 (a)(1) A major medical insurance policy issued by a health insurer that
12 insures employees, members, or subscribers for hospital and medical insurance

11 notice to the policyholder notifying the policyholder that the health insurer
12 will terminate the policy effective on the due date if payment is not received
13 within 14 days from the date of mailing of the termination notice. If a health
14 insurer does not receive payment within 14 days from the date of mailing of

5 Premium rates and rules for the classification of risk for Medicare supplement
6 insurance policies shall be governed by section 4051 of this title.
7 (2) The policy forms for major medical insurance coverage, as well as
8 the policy forms, premium rates, and rules for the classification of risk for the
9 other lines of insurance described in subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be
10 reviewed and approved or disapproved by the Commissioner. In making a
11 determination, the Commissioner shall consider whether a policy form,
12 premium rate, or rule is affordable and is not unjust, unfair, inequitable,
13 misleading, or contrary to the laws of this State; and, for a policy form for
14 major medical insurance coverage, whether it ensures equal access to
15 appropriate mental health care in a manner equivalent to other aspects of
16 health care as part of an integrated, holistic system of care. The Commissioner
17 shall make a determination within 30 days after the date the insurer filed the
18 policy form, premium rate, or rule with the Department. At the expiration of
19 the 30-day period, the form, premium rate, or rule shall be deemed approved
20 unless prior to then it has been affirmatively approved or disapproved by the
21 Commissioner or found to be incomplete. The Commissioner shall notify a

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 24 of 182
1 health insurer in writing if the insurer files any form, premium rate, or rule
2 containing a provision that does not meet the standards expressed in this
3 subsection. In such notice, the Commissioner shall state that a hearing will be
4 granted within 20 days upon the insurer’s written request.
5 (i) Notwithstanding the procedures and timelines set forth in subsections
6 (a) through (e) of this section, the Board may establish, by rule, a streamlined
7 rate review process for certain rate decisions, including proposed rates
8 affecting fewer than a minimum number of covered lives and proposed rates
9 for which a de minimis increase, as defined by the Board by rule, is sought.
10 § 4027. FILING FEES
11 Each filing of a policy, contract, or document form or premium rates or
12 rules, submitted pursuant to section 4026 of this title, shall be accompanied by
13 payment to the Commissioner or the Green Mountain Care Board, as
14 appropriate, of a nonrefundable fee of $150.00.
15 § 4028. FORM AND CONTENTS OF POLICY
16 No policy of individual health insurance shall be delivered or issued for

20 the policy.

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 25 of 182
1 (2) The policy sets forth the time at which the insurance takes effect and
2 terminates.
3 (3) The policy purports to insure only one person, except that a policy
4 may insure, originally or by subsequent amendment, upon the application of an
5 adult member of a family who shall be deemed the policyholder, any two or

12 in light-faced type of a style in general use, the size of which shall be uniform
13 and not less than 10-point with a lowercase unspaced alphabet length not less
14 than 120-point. As used in this subdivision, the “text” includes all printed
15 matter except the name and address of the insurer; the name or title of the
16 policy; the brief description, if any; and the captions and subcaptions.
17 (5) The exceptions and reductions of indemnity are set forth in the

1 exception or reduction specifically applies only to a particular benefit of the
2 policy, the statement of the exception or reduction shall be included with the

8 of the policy unless that portion is set forth in full in the policy, except in the
9 case of the incorporation of, or reference to, a statement of rates or
10 classification of risks or a short-rate table filed with the Commissioner.
11 (8) Either prominently printed on or attached to the first page of the
12 policy is a notice to the effect that during a period of 30 days following the

14 and 10 days following the date of delivery to all other persons, the policy may
15 be surrendered to the insurer together with a written request for cancellation of
16 the policy, and that in such event, the insurer will refund any premium paid,
17 including any policy fees or other charges; provided, however, that this
18 subdivision shall not apply to single premium nonrenewable policies insuring
19 against accident only or medical costs or accidental bodily injury only.

2 Except as provided in section 4031 of this title, each health insurance policy
3 delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State shall contain the
4 provisions specified in this section using the language set forth in this section;
5 provided, however, that a health insurer may, at its option, substitute different
6 language approved by the Commissioner for one or more provisions, provided
7 the substituted language is not less favorable in any respect to the insured or
8 covered individual than the language used in this section. The provisions
9 specified in this section shall be preceded individually by the caption
10 appearing in this section or, at the option of the health insurer, by such
11 appropriate captions or subcaptions as the Commissioner may approve:
12 (1) ENTIRE CONTRACT; CHANGES: This policy, including the
13 endorsements and the attached papers, if any, constitutes the entire contract of
14 insurance. No change in this policy shall be valid until approved by an
15 executive officer of the insurer and unless such approval be endorsed hereon or
16 attached hereto. No agent has authority to change this policy or to waive any
17 of its provisions.
18 (2) TIME LIMIT ON CERTAIN DEFENSES: (a) After three years
19 from the date of issue of this policy no misstatements, except fraudulent
20 misstatements, made by the applicant in the application for such policy, shall
21 be used to void the policy or to deny a claim for loss incurred or disability (as

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 28 of 182
1 defined in the policy) commencing after the expiration of such three year
2 period.
3 After this policy has been in force for a period of three years during the
4 lifetime of the insured (excluding any period during which the insured is
5 disabled), it shall become incontestable as to the statements contained in the
6 application.)
7 (b) No claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy)
8 commencing after three years from the date of issue of this policy shall be
9 reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition not
10 excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective on the date
11 of loss had existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this policy.
(2) TIME LIMIT ON CERTAIN DEFENSES: (a) After three years from
the date of issue of this policy no misstatements, except fraudulent
misstatements, made by the applicant in the application for such policy, shall
be used to void the policy or to deny a claim for loss incurred or disability (as
defined in the policy) commencing after the expiration of such three-year
period.
(The foregoing policy provision shall not be so construed as to affect any
legal requirement for avoidance of a policy or denial of a claim during such
initial three-year period, nor to limit the application of subdivisions 4030(1)–
(5) of this title in the event of misstatement with respect to age or occupation
or other insurance.) (A policy which the insured has the right to continue in
force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premium (1) until at least
age 50, or (2) in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years
from its date of issue, may contain in lieu of the foregoing the following
provision (from which the clause in parentheses may be omitted at the insurer’s
option) under the caption “INCONTESTABLE”:
After this policy has been in force for a period of three years during the
lifetime of the insured (excluding any period during which the insured is

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 29 of 182
disabled), it shall become incontestable as to the statements contained in the
application.)
(b) No claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy)
commencing after three years from the date of issue of this policy shall be
reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition not
excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective on the date of
loss had existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this policy.
1 (3) GRACE PERIOD: A grace period of . . . . (insert a number not less
2 than “7” for weekly premium policies, “10” for monthly premium policies and
3 “31” for all other policies) days will be granted for the payment of each
4 premium falling due after the first premium, during which grace period the
5 policy shall continue in force.
6 (A policy which contains a cancellation provision may add, at the end of
7 the above provision,
8 subject to the right of the insurer to cancel in accordance with the
9 cancellation provision hereof,
10 A policy in which the insurer reserves the right to refuse any renewal
11 shall have, at the beginning of the above provision,
12 Unless not less than five days prior to the premium due date the insurer has
13 delivered to the insured or has mailed to his or her last address as shown by the
14 records of the insurer written notice of its intention not to renew this policy
15 beyond the period for which the premium has been accepted.)
16 (4) REINSTATEMENT: If any renewal premium be not paid within the
17 time granted the insured for payment, a subsequent acceptance of premium by

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 30 of 182
1 the insurer or by any agent duly authorized by the insurer to accept such
2 premium, without requiring in connection therewith an application for
3 reinstatement, shall reinstate the policy; provided, however, that if the insurer
4 or such agent requires an application for reinstatement and issues a conditional
5 receipt for the premium tendered, the policy will be reinstated upon approval
6 of such application by the insurer or, lacking such approval, upon the 45th day
7 following the date of such conditional receipt unless the insurer has previously
8 notified the insured in writing of its disapproval of such application. The
9 reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from such accidental injury as
10 may be sustained after the date of reinstatement and loss due to such sickness
11 as may begin more than ten days after such date. In all other respects the
12 insured and insurer shall have the same rights thereunder as they had under the
13 policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to
14 any provisions endorsed hereon or attached hereto in connection with the
15 reinstatement. Any premium accepted in connection with a reinstatement shall
16 be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not
17 to any period more than sixty days prior to the date of reinstatement.
18 (The last sentence of the above provision may be omitted from any
19 policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms
20 by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50, or (2) in the case
21 of a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue.)

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 31 of 182
1 (5) NOTICE OF CLAIM: Written notice of claim must be given to the
2 insurer within 20 days after the occurrence or commencement of any loss
3 covered by the policy, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible. Notice
4 given by or on behalf of the insured or the beneficiary to the insurer at . . . .
5 (insert the location of such office as the insurer may designate for the
6 purpose), or to any authorized agent of the insurer, with information sufficient
7 to identify the insured, shall be deemed notice to the insurer.
8 (In a policy providing a loss-of-time benefit which may be payable for at
9 least two years, an insurer may at its option insert the following between the
10 first and second sentences of the above provision:
11 Subject to the qualifications set forth below, if the insured suffers loss of
12 time on account of disability for which indemnity may be payable for at least
13 two years, he or she shall, at least once in every sixmonths after having given
14 notice of claim, give to the insurer notice of continuance of said disability,
15 except in the event of legal incapacity. The period of sixmonths following
16 any filing of proof by the insured or any payment by the insurer on account of
17 such claim or any denial of liability in whole or in part by the insurer shall be
18 excluded in applying this provision. Delay in the giving of such notice shall
19 not impair the insured’s right to any indemnity which would otherwise have
20 accrued during the period of sixmonths preceding the date on which such
21 notice is actually given.)

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 32 of 182
1 (6) CLAIM FORMS: The insurer, upon receipt of a notice of claim, will
2 furnish to the claimant such forms as are usually furnished by it for filing
3 proofs of loss. If such forms are not furnished within 15 days after the giving
4 of such notice the claimant shall be deemed to have complied with the
5 requirements of this policy as to proof of loss upon submitting, within the time
6 fixed in the policy for filing proofs of loss, written proof covering the
7 occurrence, the character and the extent of the loss for which claim is made.
8 (7) PROOFS OF LOSS: Written proof of loss must be furnished to the
9 insurer at its said office in case of claim for loss for which this policy provides
10 any periodic payment contingent upon continuing loss within 90 days after the
11 termination of the period for which the insurer is liable and in case of claim for
12 any other loss within 90 days after the date of such loss. Failure to furnish
13 such proof within the time required shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if
14 it was not reasonably possible to give proof within such time, provided such
15 proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the
16 absence of legal capacity, later than one year from the time proof is otherwise
17 required.
18 (8) TIME OF PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Indemnities payable under this
19 policy for any loss other than loss for which this policy provides any periodic
20 payment will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof of such
21 loss. Subject to due written proof of loss, all accrued indemnities for loss for

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 33 of 182
1 which this policy provides periodic payment will be paid . . . . (insert period
2 for payment which must not be less frequently than monthly) and any balance
3 remaining unpaid upon the termination of liability will be paid immediately
4 upon receipt of due written proof.
5 (9) PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Indemnity for loss of life will be payable in
6 accordance with the beneficiary designation and the provisions respecting such
7 payment which may be prescribed herein and effective at the time of payment.
8 If no such designation or provision is then effective, such indemnity shall be
9 payable to the estate of the insured. Any other accrued indemnities unpaid at
10 the insured’s death may, at the option of the insurer, be paid either to such
11 beneficiary or to such estate. All other indemnities will be payable to the
12 insured.
13 (The following provisions, or either of them, may be included with the
14 foregoing provision at the option of the insurer:
15 If any indemnity of this policy shall be payable to the estate of the insured,
16 or to an insured or beneficiary who is a minor or otherwise not competent to
17 give a valid release, the insurer may pay such indemnity, up to an amount not
18 exceeding $. . . . . . (insert an amount which shall not exceed $1,000.00), to
19 any relative by blood or connection by civil marriage of the insured or
20 beneficiary who is deemed by the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto. Any

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 34 of 182
1 payment made by the insurer in good faith pursuant to this provision shall
2 fully discharge the insurer to the extent of such payment.
3 Subject to any written direction of the insured in the application or
4 otherwise all or a portion of any indemnities provided by this policy on
5 account of hospital, nursing, medical, or surgical services may, at the insurer’s
6 option and unless the insured requests otherwise in writing not later than the
7 time of filing proofs of such loss, be paid directly to the hospital or person
8 rendering such services; but it is not required that the service be rendered by a
9 particular hospital or person.)
10 (10) PHYSICALEXAMINATIONS AND AUTOPSY: The insurer at its
11 own expense shall have the right and the opportunity to examine the person of
12 the insured when and as often as it may reasonably require during the
13 pendency of a claim hereunder and to make an autopsy in case of death where
14 it is not forbidden by law.
15 (11) LEGALACTIONS: No action at law or in equity shall be brought to
16 recover on this policy prior to the expiration of 60 days after written proof of
17 loss has been furnished in accordance with the requirements of this policy. No
18 such action shall be brought after the expiration of three years after the time
19 written proof of loss is required to be furnished.
20 (12) CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY: Unless the insured makes an
21 irrevocable designation of beneficiary, the right to change of beneficiary is

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 35 of 182
1 reserved to the insured and the consent of the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall
2 not be requisite to surrender or assignment of this policy or to any change of
3 beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to any other changes in this policy.
4 (The first clause of this provision, relative to the irrevocable designation
5 of beneficiary, may be omitted at the insurer’s option.)
6 § 4030. OPTIONALSTANDARD POLICY PROVISIONS
7 Except as provided in section 4031 of this title, no health insurance policy
8 delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State shall contain
9 provisions respecting the matters set forth in this section unless the provisions
10 use the language set forth in this section; provided, however, that a health
11 insurer may, at its option, substitute different language approved by the
12 Commissioner for one or more provisions, provided the substituted language is
13 not less favorable in any respect to the insured or covered individual than the
14 language used in this section. Any provision set forth in this section that is
15 contained in the policy shall be preceded individually by the appropriate
16 caption appearing in this section or, at the option of the health insurer, by such
17 appropriate captions or subcaptions as the Commissioner may approve:
18 (1) CHANGE OF OCCUPATION: If the insured be injured or contract
19 sickness after having changed his or her occupation to one classified by the
20 insurer as more hazardous than that stated in this policy or while doing for
21 compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so classified, the insurer

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 36 of 182
1 will pay only such portion of the indemnities provided in this policy as the
2 premium paid would have purchased at the rates and within the limits fixed by
3 the insurer for such more hazardous occupation. If the insured changes his or
4 her occupation to one classified by the insurer as less hazardous than that
5 stated in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of such change of
6 occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly, and will return the
7 excess pro rata unearned premium from the date of change of occupation or
8 from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of such proof,
9 whichever is the more recent. In applying this provision, the classification of
10 occupational risk and the premium rates shall be such as have been last filed
11 by the insurer prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable
12 or prior to date of proof of change in occupation with the state official having
13 supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided at the time this
14 policy was issued; but if such filing was not required, then the classification of
15 occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by
16 the insurer in such state prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the date
17 of proof of change in occupation.
18 (2) MISSTATEMENT OF AGE: If the age of the insured has been
19 misstated, all amounts payable under this policy shall be such as the premium
20 paid would have purchased at the correct age.

1 (3) OTHER INSURANCE IN THIS INSURER: If an accident or
2 sickness or accident and sickness policy or policies previously issued by the
3 insurer to the insured be in force concurrently herewith, making the aggregate
4 indemnity for .... (insert type of coverage or coverages) in excess of $
5 .................... (insert maximum limit of indemnity or indemnities) the excess
6 insurance shall be void and all premiums paid for such excess shall be returned
7 to the insured or to his or her estate.
or, in lieu thereof:
8 Insurance effective at any one time on the insured under a like policy or
9 policies in this insurer is limited to the one such policy elected by the insured,
10 his or her beneficiary or his or her estate, as the case may be, and the insurer
11 will return all premiums paid for all other such policies.
12 (4) INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS: If there be other valid
13 coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a
14 provision of service basis or on an expense incurred basis and of which this
15 insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or
16 commencement of loss, the only liability under any expense incurred coverage
17 of this policy shall be for such proportion of the loss as the amount which
18 would otherwise have been payable hereunder plus the total of the like
19 amounts under all such other valid coverages for the same loss of which this
20 insurer had notice bears to the total like amounts under all valid coverages for
21 such loss, and for the return of such portion of the premiums paid as shall

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 38 of 182
1 exceed the pro rata portion for the amount so determined. For the purpose of
2 applying this provision when other coverage is on a provision of service basis,
3 the “like amount” of such other coverage shall be taken as the amount which
4 the services rendered would have cost in the absence of such coverage.
5 (If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also
6 contains the next following policy provision there shall be added to the caption
7 of the foregoing provision the phrase “—EXPENSE INCURRED
8 BENEFITS.” The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a
9 definition of “other valid coverage,” approved as to form by the
10 Commissioner, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage
11 provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by
12 insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any
13 province of Canada, and by hospital or medical service organizations, and to
14 any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the
15 Commissioner. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include
16 group insurance, automobile medical payments insurance, or coverage
17 provided by hospital or medical service organizations or by union welfare
18 plans or employer or employee benefit organizations. For the purpose of
19 applying the foregoing policy provision with respect to any insured, any
20 amount of benefit provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory
21 benefit statute (including any workers’ compensation or employer’s liability

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 39 of 182
1 statute) whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise shall in all
2 cases be deemed to be “other valid coverage” of which the insurer has had
3 notice. In applying the foregoing policy provision no third party liability
4 coverage shall be included as “other valid coverage.”)
5 (5) INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS: If there be other valid
6 coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on other
7 than an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given
8 written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only
9 liability for such benefits under this policy shall be for such proportion of the
10 indemnities otherwise provided hereunder for such loss as the like indemnities
11 of which the insurer had notice (including the indemnities under this policy)
12 bear to the total amount of all like indemnities for such loss, and for the return
13 of such portion of the premium paid as shall exceed the pro rata portion for the
14 indemnities thus determined.
15 (If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also
16 contains the next preceding policy provision there shall be added to the caption
17 of the foregoing provision the phrase “—OTHER BENEFITS.” The insurer
18 may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “other valid
19 coverage,” approved as to form by the Commissioner, which definition shall
20 be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to
21 regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 40 of 182
1 state of the United States or any province of Canada, and to any other coverage
2 the inclusion of which may be approved by the Commissioner. In the absence
3 of such definition such term shall not include group insurance, or benefits
4 provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit
5 organizations. For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy provision with
6 respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such insured
7 pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers’
8 compensation or employer’s liability statute) whether provided by a
9 governmental agency or otherwise shall in all cases be deemed to be “other
10 valid coverage” of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing
11 policy provision no third party liability coverage shall be included as “other
12 valid coverage.”)
13 (6) RELATION OF EARNINGS TO INSURANCE: If the total monthly
14 amount of loss of time benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss
15 of time coverage upon the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly
16 basis, shall exceed the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability
17 commenced or his or her average monthly earnings for the period of two years
18 immediately preceding a disability for which claim is made, whichever is the
19 greater, the insurer will be liable only for such proportionate amount of such
20 benefits under this policy as the amount of such monthly earnings or such
21 average monthly earnings of the insured bears to the total amount of monthly

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 41 of 182
1 benefits for the same loss under all such coverage upon the insured at the time
2 such disability commences and for the return of such part of the premiums
3 paid during such two years as shall exceed the pro rata amount of the
4 premiums for the benefits actually paid hereunder; but this shall not operate to
5 reduce the total monthly amount of benefits payable under all such coverage
6 upon the insured below the sum of $200.00 or the sum of the monthly benefits
7 specified in such coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to
8 reduce benefits other than those payable for loss of time.
9 (The foregoing policy provision may be inserted only in a policy which
10 the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely
11 payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50; or (2) in the case of a policy
12 issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue. The insurer
13 may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “valid loss of time
14 coverage,” approved as to form by the Commissioner, which definition shall
15 be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by governmental agencies or
16 by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance
17 authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of
18 Canada, or to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by
19 the Commissioner or any combination of such coverages. In the absence of
20 such definition such term shall not include any coverage provided for such
21 insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers’

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 42 of 182
1 compensation or employer’s liability statute), or benefits provided by union
2 welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations.)
3 (7) UNPAID PREMIUM: Upon the payment of a claim under this policy,
4 any premium then due and unpaid or covered by any note or written order may
5 be deducted therefrom.
6 (8) CANCELLATION: The insurer may cancel this policy at any time by
7 written notice delivered to the insured, or mailed to his or her last address as
8 shown by the records of the insurer, stating when, not less than five days
9 thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective; and after the policy has been
10 continued beyond its original term the insured may cancel this policy at any
11 time by written notice delivered or mailed to the insurer, effective upon receipt
12 or on such later date as may be specified in such notice. In the event of
13 cancellation, the insurer will return promptly the unearned portion of any
14 premium paid. If the insured cancels, the earned premium shall be computed
15 by the use of the short-rate table last filed with the state official having
16 supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided when the policy
17 was issued. If the insurer cancels, the earned premium shall be computed pro
18 rata. Cancellation shall be without prejudice to any claim originating prior to
19 the effective date of cancellation.
20 (9) CONFORMITY WITH STATE STATUTES: Any provision of this
21 policy which, on its effective date, is in conflict with the statutes of the state in

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 43 of 182
1 which the insured resides on such date is hereby amended to conform to the
2 minimum requirements of such statutes.
3 (10) ILLEGALOCCUPATION: The insurer shall not be liable for any loss
4 to which a contributing cause was the insured’s commission of or attempt to
5 commit a felony or to which a contributing cause was the insured’s being
6 engaged in an illegal occupation.
7 § 4031. OMISSION OF INAPPLICABLE OR INCONSISTENT
8 STANDARD PROVISIONS
9 If any provision of sections 4029 and 4030 of this title is in whole or in part
10 inapplicable to or inconsistent with the coverage provided by a particular form
11 of policy, the health insurer, with the approval of the Commissioner, shall omit
12 from such policy any inapplicable provision or part of a provision, and shall
13 modify any inconsistent provision or part of the provision in such manner as to
14 make the provision as contained in the policy consistent with the coverage
15 provided by the policy.
16 § 4032. ORDER OF STANDARD POLICY PROVISIONS
17 The provisions specified in sections 4029 and 4030 of this title, or any
18 corresponding provisions used in lieu of those provisions as permitted by those
19 sections, shall either be printed in the same order as the provisions are set forth
20 in those sections or, at the option of the health insurer, any such provision may
21 appear as a unit in any part of the policy, with other provisions to which it may

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 44 of 182
1 be logically related, provided the resulting policy shall not be in whole or in
2 part unintelligible, uncertain, ambiguous, abstruse, or likely to mislead a
3 person to whom the policy is offered, delivered, or issued.
4 § 4033. DISCRETIONARY CLAUSES PROHIBITED
5 (a) The purpose of this section is to ensure that health insurance benefits,
6 disability income protection coverage, and life insurance benefits are
7 contractually guaranteed and to avoid the conflict of interest that may occur
8 when the carrier responsible for providing benefits has discretionary authority
9 to decide what benefits are due. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
10 impose any requirement or duty on any person other than a health insurer or a
11 health insurer offering disability income protection coverage or life insurance.
12 (b) As used in this section:
13 (1) “Disability income protection coverage” means a policy, contract,
14 certificate, or agreement that provides for weekly, monthly, or other periodic
15 payments for a specified period during the continuance of disability resulting
16 from illness, injury, or a combination of illness and injury.
17 (2) “Health insurer” has the same meaning as in section 4021 of this
18 chapter and, as used in this section, also includes entities offering policies for
19 specific disease, accident, injury, hospital indemnity, dental care, disability
20 income, long-term care, and other limited benefit coverage.

1 (3) “Life insurance” means a policy, contract, certificate, or agreement
2 that provides life insurance as defined in subdivision 3301(a)(1) of this title.
3 (c) No policy, contract, certificate, or agreement offered or issued in this
4 State by a health insurer to provide, deliver, arrange for, pay for, or reimburse
5 any of the costs of health care services may contain a provision purporting to
6 reserve discretion to the health insurer to interpret the terms of the contract or
7 to provide standards of interpretation or review that are inconsistent with the
8 laws of this State, and any such provision in a policy, contract, certificate, or
9 agreement shall be null and void.
10 (d) No policy, contract, certificate, or agreement offered or issued in this
11 State providing for disability income protection coverage may contain a
12 provision purporting to reserve discretion to the insurer to interpret the terms
13 of the contract or to provide standards of interpretation or review that are
14 inconsistent with the laws of this State, and any such provision in a policy,
15 contract, certificate, or agreement shall be null and void.
16 (e) No policy, contract, certificate, or agreement of life insurance offered
17 or issued in this State shall contain a provision purporting to reserve discretion
18 to the insurer to interpret the terms of the contract or to provide standards of
19 interpretation or review that are inconsistent with the laws of this State, and
20 any such provision in a policy, contract, certificate, or agreement shall be null
21 and void.

2 (a) Any policy of a foreign or alien insurer, when delivered or issued for
3 delivery to any person in this State, may contain any provision that is not less
4 favorable to the covered individual than the provisions of this chapter and that
5 is prescribed or required by the law of the state under which the insurer is
6 organized.
7 (b) Any policy of a domestic health insurer, when issued for delivery in
8 any other state or country, may contain any provision permitted or required by
9 the laws of such other state or country.
10 § 4035. POLICIES NOT AFFECTED
11 Nothing in sections 4018–4020, 4023, 4028–4032, 4034, 4036, and 4037 of
12 this title shall apply to or affect:
13 (1) any policy of workers’ compensation insurance or any policy of
14 liability insurance, with or without supplementary coverage;
15 (2) any policy or contract of reinsurance;

20 supplemental to those contracts, that contain only such provisions relating to
21 accident and sickness insurance as:

1 (A) provide additional benefits in case of death or dismemberment or
2 loss of sight by accident; or
3 (B) operate to safeguard the contracts against lapse or to give a
4 special surrender value or special benefit or an annuity in the event that the
5 insured or annuitant becomes totally and permanently disabled, as defined by
6 the contract or supplemental contract.
7 § 4036. NONCONFORMING POLICIES
8 (a) A health insurance policy shall not contain any provision that makes the
9 policy or any portion of the policy less favorable in any respect to the covered
10 individual than the provisions of the policy that are regulated by sections 4029
11 and 4030 of this title.
12 (b) A policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State in
13 violation of sections 4029 and 4030 of this title shall be held valid but shall be
14 construed as provided in this chapter. When any provision in a policy
15 regulated by sections 4029 and 4030 is in conflict with any provision of those
16 sections, the rights, duties, and obligations of the health insurer and the
17 covered individual shall be governed by the provisions of those sections.
18 § 4037. APPLICATIONS FOR INSURANCE
19 (a)(1) A covered individual shall not be bound by any statement made in
20 an application for a policy unless a copy of the application is attached to or
21 endorsed on the policy as a part of the policy when issued.

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 48 of 182
1 (2) If a policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State
2 is reinstated or renewed and the covered individual or assignee of the policy
3 makes a written request to the health insurer for a copy of the application, if
4 any, for such reinstatement or renewal, the health insurer shall deliver or mail
5 a copy of the application to the individual making the request within 15 days
6 after the receipt of the request. If the health insurer does not deliver or mail
7 the copy within 15 days, the health insurer shall be precluded from introducing
8 the application as evidence in any action or proceeding based on or involving
9 the policy or its reinstatement or renewal.
10 (b) No alteration of a written application for a policy shall be made by any
11 person other than the applicant without the applicant’s written consent, except
12 that insertions may be made by the health insurer, for administrative purposes
13 only, in a manner that indicates clearly that the insertions are not to be ascribed
14 to the applicant.
15 (c) The falsity of any statement in an application for a policy shall not bar
16 the right to recovery under the policy unless the false statement materially
17 affected either the acceptance of the risk or the hazard assumed by the health
18 insurer.
19 § 4038. RULEMAKING ON POLICY FILINGS
20 The Commissioner may adopt such reasonable rules concerning the
21 procedure for the filing or submission of policies subject to sections 4023 and

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 49 of 182
1 4028–4030 of this title as are necessary, proper, or advisable for the
2 administration of these sections. This provision shall not abridge any other
3 authority granted to the Commissioner by law.

20 PROVISIONS

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 54 of 182
1 (a) Terms and conditions. No group health insurance policy shall contain
2 any provision relating to notice of claim, proofs of loss, time of payment of
3 claims, or time within which legal action must be brought upon the policy that,
4 in the opinion of the Commissioner, is less favorable to the persons insured
5 than would be permitted by the provisions set forth in section 4029 of this title.
6 In addition, each such policy shall contain in substance the following
7 provisions:
8 (1) A provision that the policy; the application of the policyholder, if an
9 application or copy is attached to the policy; and the individual applications, if
10 any, submitted by the employees or members in connection with the policy
11 shall constitute the entire contract between the parties, and that all statements,
12 in the absence of fraud, made by any applicant or applicants shall be deemed
13 representations and not warranties, and that no such statement shall avoid the
14 insurance or reduce benefits under the policy unless contained in a written
15 application, of which a copy is attached to the policy.
16 (2) A provision that the health insurer will furnish to the policyholder,
17 for delivery to each employee or member of the insured group, an individual
18 certificate setting forth in summary form a statement of the essential features
19 of the insurance coverage of the employee or member and to whom benefits
20 are payable under the policy. If dependents are included in the coverage, only
21 one certificate need be issued for each family unit.

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 55 of 182
1 (3) A provision that to the group originally insured may be added from
2 time to time eligible new employees or members or dependents, as the case
3 may be, in accordance with the terms of the policy.
4 (4) A provision that the health insurer shall not exclude part-time
5 employees and shall offer the same group health benefits to part-time
6 employees as it offers to the employee groups of which the part-time
7 employees would be members if they were full-time employees. The health
8 insurer shall offer to include the part-time employees as part of the employer’s
9 employee group, at the full rate to be paid by the employer and the employee,
10 at a rate prorated between the employer and the employee, or at the
11 employee’s expense. As used in this subdivision, “part-time employee” means
12 any employee who works a minimum of at least 17.5 hours per week.
13 (b) Protections for covered individuals.

15 contain any provision that excludes, restricts, or otherwise limits coverage

18 (A)(i) The annual limitation on cost sharing for self-only coverage
19 for any year shall be the same as the dollar limit established by the federal
20 government for self-only coverage for that year in accordance with 45 C.F.R.
21 § 156.130.

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 56 of 182
1 (ii) The annual limitation on cost sharing for other than self-only
2 coverage for any year shall be twice the dollar limit for self-only coverage
3 described in subdivision (i) of this subdivision (A).
4 (B)(i) In the event that the federal government does not establish an
5 annual limitation on cost sharing for any plan year, the annual limitation on
6 cost sharing for self-only coverage for that year shall be the dollar limit for
7 self-only coverage in the preceding calendar year, increased by any percentage
8 by which the average per capita premium for health insurance coverage in
9 Vermont for the preceding calendar year exceeds the average per capita
10 premium for the year before that.
11 (ii) The annual limitation on cost sharing for other than self-only
12 coverage for any year in which the federal government does not establish an
13 annual limitation on cost sharing shall be twice the dollar limit for self-only
14 coverage described in subdivision (i) of this subdivision (B).

2 the Commissioner for determining premiums for Medicare supplement
3 insurance policies.
4 (2) The Commissioner shall adopt rules for standards and procedure for
5 permitting health insurers that issue Medicare supplement insurance policies to
6 use one or more risk classifications in their community rating method. The
7 premium charged shall not deviate from the community rate and the rules shall
8 not permit medical underwriting and screening, except that a health insurer
9 may set different community rates for persons eligible for Medicare by reason
10 of age and persons eligible for Medicare by reason of disability.
11 (b) Premium increases.
12 (1) Within five days after receiving a request for approval of any
13 composite average rate increase in excess of three percent, or any other
14 coverage changes that the Commissioner determines will have a comparable
15 impact on cost or availability of coverage for a Medicare supplement insurance
16 policy issued by any health insurer with 5,000 or more total lives in the
17 Vermont Medicare supplement insurance market, the Commissioner shall

4 to 33 V.S.A. § 505 of the proposed premium increase.
5 (3)(A) The Commissioner shall not approve any request to increase
6 Medicare supplement insurance premium rates unless the amount of the rate
7 increase complies with the statutory standards for approval under sections
8 4026, 4513, 4584, and 5104 of this title. Any approved rate increase shall not
9 be based on an unreasonable change in loss ratio from the previous year, unless
10 the Commissioner makes written findings that such change is necessary to
11 prevent a substantial adverse impact on the financial condition of the health
12 insurer. In acting on such rate increase requests, the Commissioner may deny
13 the request, approve the rate increase as requested, or approve a rate increase
14 in an amount different from the increase requested. A decision by the
15 Commissioner other than an approval of the rate requested may be appealed by
16 the health insurer, provided that the burden of proof shall be on the health
17 insurer to show that the approved rate does not meet the statutory standards
18 established under this subsection.
19 (B) Before acting on the rate increase requested, the Commissioner
20 may make such examination or investigation as the Commissioner deems

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30

2 subdivision (C) of this subdivision (3).
3 (C)(i) In reviewing any Medicare supplement insurance rate increase
4 for which an independent analysis has been performed pursuant to 33 V.S.A.
5 § 6706 and in which the health insurer’s requested composite average increase,
6 the independent expert’s recommended composite average rate increase, or the
7 Department actuary’s recommended composite average rate increase differ by
8 two percentage points or more, the Commissioner shall hold a public hearing
9 at which the health insurer, the Department’s actuary, the independent expert,
10 any intervenor, and the public will have the opportunity to present written and
11 oral testimony and will be available to answer questions of the Commissioner
12 and those present.
13 (ii) The hearing shall be noticed and held at a time and place so as
14 to facilitate public participation, and shall be recorded and become part of the
15 record before the Commissioner. At the Commissioner’s discretion, the
16 hearing may be conducted remotely.
17 (iii) If the carrier’s requested composite average increase, the
18 independent expert’s recommended composite average increase, or the
19 Department actuary’s recommended composite average increase differs by less
20 than two percentage points, the Department and the parties shall confer by
21 conference call, or by any other available media, to review the rate requests

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 72 of 182
1 and recommendations. However, a public hearing may be held at the
2 Commissioner’s discretion for good cause shown.
3 (D)(i) In any review held in accordance with this subdivision (3), the
4 Commissioner shall permit intervention by any person whom the
5 Commissioner determines will materially advance the interests of the covered
6 individuals. The intervenor shall have access to and may use the information
7 of the independent expert appointed under 33 V.S.A. § 6706.
8 (ii) The reasonable and necessary cost of intervention as
9 determined by the Commissioner shall be paid by the affected policyholders or
10 certificate holders. The maximum payment shall be $2,500.00 except when
11 waived by the Commissioner for good cause shown. The $2,500.00 maximum
12 amount may be adjusted to reflect, at the Commissioner’s discretion,
13 appropriate inflation factors.
14 (E) Nonproprietary, relevant information in any Medicare
15 supplement insurance rate filing, including any analysis by the Department’s
16 actuary and the independent expert, shall be made available to the public upon
17 request.
18 (c) Disability.
19 (1) A health insurer that issues Medicare supplement insurance policies
20 or certificates to a person eligible for Medicare by reason of age shall make
21 available, to persons eligible for Medicare by reason of disability, the same

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 73 of 182
1 policies or certificates that are offered and sold to persons eligible for
2 Medicare by reason of age. The initial enrollment period for any such policies
3 or certificates shall be at least sixmonths following the date the individual
4 becomes eligible for Medicare by reason of disability. Any additional
5 enrollment periods as required by law and offered to individuals eligible by
6 reason of age shall be offered to individuals eligible by reason of disability.
7 (2) This subsection does not apply to persons eligible for Medicare by
8 reason of end stage renal disease.

13 insurance policies and Medicare Advantage plans, including information to
14 help the public understand issues relating to coverage, costs, and provider
15 networks.

18 activities; or
19 (5) under a policy or contract issued to any other substantially similar
20 group that, in the discretion of the Commissioner and after the prior approval

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.30
2025 Page 75 of 182
1 by the Commissioner of the group, may be subject to the issuance of a blanket
2 health policy or contract.
3 (b)(1) No blanket health insurance policy shall contain any provision
4 relating to notice of claim, proofs of loss, time of payment of claims, or time
5 within which legal action must be brought upon the policy that, in the opinion
6 of the Commissioner, is less favorable to the persons insured than would be
7 permitted by the provisions set forth in section 4029 of this title.
8 (2) An individual application shall not be required from a person
9 covered under a blanket health policy or contract, nor shall it be necessary for
10 the insurer to furnish each person a certificate.
11 (3) All benefits under any blanket health policy shall, unless for hospital
12 and physician service or surgical benefits, be payable to the person insured, or
13 to the person’s designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to the person’s
14 estate, except that if the person insured is a minor, the benefits may be made
15 payable to the minor’s parent, guardian, or other person actually supporting
16 the minor.
17 (4) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the legal liability of
18 policyholders for the death of, or injury to, any members of the group.
19 (c) No blanket health insurance policy that provides coverage for the

2025 Page 76 of 182
1 a rule adopted pursuant to this title applicable to health insurance, other than
2 those requirements applicable to nongroup health insurance or small group
3 health insurance. The Commissioner may waive the application to a blanket
4 insurance policy of one or more of the health insurance requirements of this
5 title, or a rule adopted pursuant to this title, if the requirement is not relevant

18 (c) A short-term, limited-duration health insurance policy or contract shall
19 be nonrenewable, and a health insurer shall not issue a short-term, limited-
20 duration health insurance policy or contract to any person if the issuance

2025 Page 77 of 182
1 would result in the person being covered by short-term, limited-duration health
2 insurance coverage for more than three months in any 12-month period.
3 (d) A policy or contract for short-term, limited-duration health insurance
4 coverage shall display prominently in the policy or contract and in any

6 in at least 14-point type, certain disclosures regarding the scope of short-term,

17 covered individual warrant a waiver or reduction. The application fee shall be
18 paid by the health insurer, not the covered individual, if the independent
19 review organization reverses the health insurer’s decision to deny payment for
20 a health care service.
