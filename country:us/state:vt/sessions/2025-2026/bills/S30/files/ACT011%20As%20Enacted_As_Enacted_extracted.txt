plan offered by a public or private entity.
(5) “Major medical insurance” means a comprehensive health insurance

requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996, as amended from time to time (42 U.S.C. Chapter 6A, Subchapter
XXV), and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, Pub. L.

No health insurer shall make or permit any unfair discrimination between
individuals of substantially the same hazard in the amount of premium rates

premium rates, different benefits, or different underwriting procedure for
individuals insured under group, family expense, or blanket plans of insurance.

Section 5:
§ 4014. ADVERTISING PRACTICES
(a) No company doing business in this State, and no insurance agent or
broker, shall use in connection with the solicitation of health insurance or
pharmacy benefit management any advertising copy or advertising practice or
any plan of solicitation that is materially misleading or deceptive. An
advertising copy or advertising practice or plan of solicitation shall be
considered to be materially misleading or deceptive if by implication or
otherwise it transmits information in such manner or of such substance that a
prospective applicant for health insurance may be misled by it to the
applicant’s material damage.
(b)(1) If the Commissioner finds that any such advertising copy or
advertising practice or plan of solicitation is materially misleading or
deceptive, the Commissioner shall order the company or the agent or broker
using such copy or practice or plan to cease and desist from such use.
(2) Before making any such finding and order, the Commissioner shall
give notice, not less than 10 days in advance, and a hearing to the company,
agent, or broker affected.
(3) If the Commissioner finds, after due notice and hearing, that any
authorized insurer, licensed pharmacy benefit manager, licensed insurance
agent, or licensed insurance broker has intentionally violated any such order to
cease and desist, the Commissioner may suspend or revoke the license of such
insurer, pharmacy benefit manager, agent, or broker.

agent for any such intentional violation.

Section 7:
§ 4016. APPEAL
(a) Any person aggrieved by any action of the Commissioner may obtain a
review by appeal to the Superior Court of Washington County. The appeal
shall be based on the record of the proceedings before the Commissioner and
shall not be limited to questions of law. If the appeal is from an order of the
Commissioner, the order shall not take effect during the pendency of the

Section 8:
§ 4017. EXEMPTION FROM ATTACHMENT AND TRUSTEE PROCESS
So much of any benefits under all policies of health insurance as does not

policy shall not be liable to attachment, trustee process, or other process, or to
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 6 of 173
2025
be seized, taken, appropriated, or applied by any legal or equitable process or
by operation of law, either before or after payment of such benefits, to pay any
debt or liabilities of the person insured under the policy. However, this
exemption shall not apply where an action is brought to recover for necessaries
contracted for during the period of disability and the writ or bill of complaint
contains a statement to that effect. When a policy provides for a lump sum
payment because of a dismemberment or other loss insured, the payment shall
be exempt from execution of the covered individual’s creditors.

Section 9:
§ 4018. THIRD-PARTY OWNERSHIP
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as preventing a person other than
the covered individual with proper insurable interest from making application
for and owning a policy covering the covered individual or from being entitled
under such a policy to any indemnities, benefits, and rights provided in the
policy.

Section 10:
§ 4019. NOTICE AS WAIVER
A health insurer shall not be deemed to have waived any rights to defend a
claim under a health insurance plan based solely on the health insurer’s
acknowledgement of receipt of notice under the plan, furnishing or accepting
forms for filing proof of loss under the plan, or investigating any claim of loss
under the plan.

limit or otherwise, a date after which the coverage provided by the plan will
not be effective, and if that date falls within a period for which the health
insurer has accepted a premium or if the health insurer accepts a premium after
that date, the coverage provided by the plan shall continue in force subject to
any right of cancellation until the end of the period for which a premium has
been accepted.
(b) Notwithstanding any provision of subsection (a) of this section to the
contrary, if the age of the covered individual has been misstated and if,
according to the correct age of the covered individual, the coverage provided
by the policy would not have become effective or would have ceased prior to
the health insurer’s acceptance of the premium or premiums, then the health
insurer’s liability shall be limited to the refund, upon request, of all premiums
paid for the period not covered by the plan.

Section 12:
§ 4021. TERMINATION OF COVERAGE
(a)(1) A major medical insurance policy issued by a health insurer that
insures employees, members, or subscribers for hospital and medical insurance
on an expense-incurred, service, or prepaid basis shall:
(A) provide notice to the policyholder or other responsible party of
any premium payment due on a policy at least 21 days before the due date; and

each premium falling due after the first premium, during which grace period
the plan shall continue in force and the issuer of the plan shall be liable for
valid claims for covered losses incurred prior to the end of the grace period.
(2) If the issuer of a plan described subdivision (1) of this subsection
does not receive payment by the due date, the issuer shall send a termination
notice to the policyholder at least 21 days prior to termination notifying the
policyholder that the issuer may terminate the plan if payment is not received
by the termination date.
(3) The termination date of a plan described in subdivision (1) of this
subsection shall not be earlier than the day following the last day of the grace
period set forth in subdivision (1)(A) of this subsection.
(b) For all health insurance policies other than major medical insurance
policies, a health insurer shall notify a policyholder of any premium payment
due on a policy at least 21 days before the due date. If a health insurer does
not receive payment by the due date, the health insurer shall send a termination
notice to the policyholder notifying the policyholder that the health insurer will
terminate the policy effective on the due date if payment is not received within
14 days from the date of mailing of the termination notice. If a health insurer
does not receive payment within 14 days from the date of mailing of the

from compensating agents, brokers, or other individuals through the

premium rate, or rule is affordable and is not unjust, unfair, inequitable,
misleading, or contrary to the laws of this State; and, for a policy form for
major medical insurance coverage, whether it ensures equal access to
appropriate mental health care in a manner equivalent to other aspects of health
care as part of an integrated, holistic system of care. The Commissioner shall
make a determination within 30 days after the date the insurer filed the policy
form, premium rate, or rule with the Department. At the expiration of the 30-
day period, the form, premium rate, or rule shall be deemed approved unless
prior to then it has been affirmatively approved or disapproved by the
Commissioner or found to be incomplete. The Commissioner shall notify a
health insurer in writing if the insurer files any form, premium rate, or rule
containing a provision that does not meet the standards expressed in this
subsection. In such notice, the Commissioner shall state that a hearing will be
granted within 20 days upon the insurer’s written request.
(i) Notwithstanding the procedures and timelines set forth in subsections
(a) through (e) of this section, the Board may establish, by rule, a streamlined
rate review process for certain rate decisions, including proposed rates
affecting fewer than a minimum number of covered lives and proposed rates
for which a de minimis increase, as defined by the Board by rule, is sought.

Section 22:
§ 4027. FILING FEES
Each filing of a policy, contract, or document form or premium rates or
rules, submitted pursuant to section 4026 of this title, shall be accompanied by
payment to the Commissioner or the Green Mountain Care Board, as
appropriate, of a nonrefundable fee of $150.00.

Section 23:
§ 4028. FORM AND CONTENTS OF POLICY
No policy of individual health insurance shall be delivered or issued for
delivery to any person in this State unless all of the following conditions are
met:
(1) The policy sets forth all of the monetary and other considerations for
the policy.
(2) The policy sets forth the time at which the insurance takes effect and
terminates.
(3) The policy purports to insure only one person, except that a policy
may insure, originally or by subsequent amendment, upon the application of an
adult member of a family who shall be deemed the policyholder, any two or
more eligible members of that family, including a spouse or civil union
partner, dependent children or any children under a specified age that shall not
exceed 26 years of age, and any other person dependent upon the policyholder.
(4) The style, arrangement, and overall appearance of the policy give no
undue prominence to any portion of the text, and every printed portion of the
text of the policy and of any endorsements or attached papers is plainly printed
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 24 of 173
2025
in light-faced type of a style in general use, the size of which shall be uniform
and not less than 10-point with a lowercase unspaced alphabet length not less
than 120-point. As used in this subdivision, the “text” includes all printed
matter except the name and address of the insurer; the name or title of the
policy; the brief description, if any; and the captions and subcaptions.
(5) The exceptions and reductions of indemnity are set forth in the
policy and, except those that are set forth in sections 4029 and 4030 of this
title, are printed, at the insurer’s option, either with the benefit provision to
which they apply or under an appropriate caption such as “EXCEPTIONS” or
“EXCEPTIONS AND REDUCTIONS”; provided, however, that if an
exception or reduction specifically applies only to a particular benefit of the
policy, the statement of the exception or reduction shall be included with the
benefit provision to which it applies.
(6) Each policy form, including riders and endorsements, is identified by
a form number in the lower left-hand corner of the first page of the form.
(7) The policy does not contain any provision purporting to make any
portion of the charter, rules, constitution, or bylaws of the health insurer a part
of the policy unless that portion is set forth in full in the policy, except in the
case of the incorporation of, or reference to, a statement of rates or
classification of risks or a short-rate table filed with the Commissioner.
(8) Either prominently printed on or attached to the first page of the
policy is a notice to the effect that during a period of 30 days following the
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 25 of 173
2025
date the policy is delivered to persons eligible for Medicare by reason of age,
and 10 days following the date of delivery to all other persons, the policy may
be surrendered to the insurer together with a written request for cancellation of
the policy, and that in such event, the insurer will refund any premium paid,
including any policy fees or other charges; provided, however, that this
subdivision shall not apply to single premium nonrenewable policies insuring
against accident only or medical costs or accidental bodily injury only.

Section 24:
§ 4029. REQUIRED STANDARD POLICY PROVISIONS
Except as provided in section 4031 of this title, each health insurance policy
delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State shall contain the
provisions specified in this section using the language set forth in this section;
provided, however, that a health insurer may, at its option, substitute different
language approved by the Commissioner for one or more provisions, provided
the substituted language is not less favorable in any respect to the insured or
covered individual than the language used in this section. The provisions
specified in this section shall be preceded individually by the caption appearing
in this section or, at the option of the health insurer, by such appropriate
captions or subcaptions as the Commissioner may approve:
(1) ENTIRE CONTRACT; CHANGES: This policy, including the
endorsements and the attached papers, if any, constitutes the entire contract of
insurance. No change in this policy shall be valid until approved by an
executive officer of the insurer and unless such approval be endorsed hereon or
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 26 of 173
2025
attached hereto. No agent has authority to change this policy or to waive any
of its provisions.
(2) TIME LIMIT ON CERTAIN DEFENSES: (a) After three years
from the date of issue of this policy no misstatements, except fraudulent
misstatements, made by the applicant in the application for such policy, shall
be used to void the policy or to deny a claim for loss incurred or disability (as
defined in the policy) commencing after the expiration of such three-year
period.
(The foregoing policy provision shall not be so construed as to affect any
legal requirement for avoidance of a policy or denial of a claim during such
initial three-year period, nor to limit the application of subdivisions 4030(1)–
(5) of this title in the event of misstatement with respect to age or occupation
or other insurance.) (A policy which the insured has the right to continue in
force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premium (1) until at least
age 50, or (2) in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years
from its date of issue, may contain in lieu of the foregoing the following
provision (from which the clause in parentheses may be omitted at the
insurer’s option) under the caption “INCONTESTABLE”:
After this policy has been in force for a period of three years during the
lifetime of the insured (excluding any period during which the insured is
disabled), it shall become incontestable as to the statements contained in the
application.)
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 27 of 173
2025
(b) No claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy)
commencing after three years from the date of issue of this policy shall be
reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition not
excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective on the date
of loss had existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this policy.
(3) GRACE PERIOD: A grace period of . . . . (insert a number not less
than “7” for weekly premium policies, “10” for monthly premium policies and
“31” for all other policies) days will be granted for the payment of each
premium falling due after the first premium, during which grace period the
policy shall continue in force.
(A policy which contains a cancellation provision may add, at the end of
the above provision,
subject to the right of the insurer to cancel in accordance with the
cancellation provision hereof,
A policy in which the insurer reserves the right to refuse any renewal
shall have, at the beginning of the above provision,
Unless not less than five days prior to the premium due date the insurer has
delivered to the insured or has mailed to his or her last address as shown by the
records of the insurer written notice of its intention not to renew this policy
beyond the period for which the premium has been accepted.)
(4) REINSTATEMENT: If any renewal premium be not paid within the
time granted the insured for payment, a subsequent acceptance of premium by
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 28 of 173
2025
the insurer or by any agent duly authorized by the insurer to accept such
premium, without requiring in connection therewith an application for
reinstatement, shall reinstate the policy; provided, however, that if the insurer
or such agent requires an application for reinstatement and issues a conditional
receipt for the premium tendered, the policy will be reinstated upon approval
of such application by the insurer or, lacking such approval, upon the 45th day
following the date of such conditional receipt unless the insurer has previously
notified the insured in writing of its disapproval of such application. The
reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from such accidental injury as
may be sustained after the date of reinstatement and loss due to such sickness
as may begin more than ten days after such date. In all other respects the
insured and insurer shall have the same rights thereunder as they had under the
policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to
any provisions endorsed hereon or attached hereto in connection with the
reinstatement. Any premium accepted in connection with a reinstatement shall
be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not
to any period more than sixty days prior to the date of reinstatement.
(The last sentence of the above provision may be omitted from any
policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms
by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50, or (2) in the case
of a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue.)
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 29 of 173
2025
(5) NOTICE OF CLAIM: Written notice of claim must be given to the
insurer within 20 days after the occurrence or commencement of any loss
covered by the policy, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible. Notice
given by or on behalf of the insured or the beneficiary to the insurer at . . . .
(insert the location of such office as the insurer may designate for the purpose),
or to any authorized agent of the insurer, with information sufficient to identify
the insured, shall be deemed notice to the insurer.
(In a policy providing a loss-of-time benefit which may be payable for at
least two years, an insurer may at its option insert the following between the
first and second sentences of the above provision:
Subject to the qualifications set forth below, if the insured suffers loss of
time on account of disability for which indemnity may be payable for at least
two years, he or she shall, at least once in every six months after having given
notice of claim, give to the insurer notice of continuance of said disability,
except in the event of legal incapacity. The period of six months following any
filing of proof by the insured or any payment by the insurer on account of such
claim or any denial of liability in whole or in part by the insurer shall be
excluded in applying this provision. Delay in the giving of such notice shall
not impair the insured’s right to any indemnity which would otherwise have
accrued during the period of six months preceding the date on which such
notice is actually given.)
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 30 of 173
2025
(6) CLAIM FORMS: The insurer, upon receipt of a notice of claim, will
furnish to the claimant such forms as are usually furnished by it for filing
proofs of loss. If such forms are not furnished within 15 days after the giving
of such notice the claimant shall be deemed to have complied with the
requirements of this policy as to proof of loss upon submitting, within the time
fixed in the policy for filing proofs of loss, written proof covering the
occurrence, the character and the extent of the loss for which claim is made.
(7) PROOFS OF LOSS: Written proof of loss must be furnished to the
insurer at its said office in case of claim for loss for which this policy provides
any periodic payment contingent upon continuing loss within 90 days after the
termination of the period for which the insurer is liable and in case of claim for
any other loss within 90 days after the date of such loss. Failure to furnish
such proof within the time required shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if
it was not reasonably possible to give proof within such time, provided such
proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the
absence of legal capacity, later than one year from the time proof is otherwise
required.
(8) TIME OF PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Indemnities payable under this
policy for any loss other than loss for which this policy provides any periodic
payment will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof of such
loss. Subject to due written proof of loss, all accrued indemnities for loss for
which this policy provides periodic payment will be paid . . . . (insert period for
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 31 of 173
2025
payment which must not be less frequently than monthly) and any balance
remaining unpaid upon the termination of liability will be paid immediately
upon receipt of due written proof.
(9) PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Indemnity for loss of life will be payable in
accordance with the beneficiary designation and the provisions respecting such
payment which may be prescribed herein and effective at the time of payment.
If no such designation or provision is then effective, such indemnity shall be
payable to the estate of the insured. Any other accrued indemnities unpaid at
the insured’s death may, at the option of the insurer, be paid either to such
beneficiary or to such estate. All other indemnities will be payable to the
insured.
(The following provisions, or either of them, may be included with the
foregoing provision at the option of the insurer:
If any indemnity of this policy shall be payable to the estate of the insured,
or to an insured or beneficiary who is a minor or otherwise not competent to
give a valid release, the insurer may pay such indemnity, up to an amount not
exceeding $. . . . . . (insert an amount which shall not exceed $1,000.00), to any
relative by blood or connection by civil marriage of the insured or beneficiary
who is deemed by the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto. Any payment
made by the insurer in good faith pursuant to this provision shall fully
discharge the insurer to the extent of such payment.
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 32 of 173
2025
Subject to any written direction of the insured in the application or
otherwise all or a portion of any indemnities provided by this policy on
account of hospital, nursing, medical, or surgical services may, at the insurer’s
option and unless the insured requests otherwise in writing not later than the
time of filing proofs of such loss, be paid directly to the hospital or person
rendering such services; but it is not required that the service be rendered by a
particular hospital or person.)
(10) PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS AND AUTOPSY: The insurer at its
own expense shall have the right and the opportunity to examine the person of
the insured when and as often as it may reasonably require during the
pendency of a claim hereunder and to make an autopsy in case of death where
it is not forbidden by law.
(11) LEGAL ACTIONS: No action at law or in equity shall be brought to
recover on this policy prior to the expiration of 60 days after written proof of
loss has been furnished in accordance with the requirements of this policy. No
such action shall be brought after the expiration of three years after the time
written proof of loss is required to be furnished.
(12) CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY: Unless the insured makes an
irrevocable designation of beneficiary, the right to change of beneficiary is
reserved to the insured and the consent of the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall
not be requisite to surrender or assignment of this policy or to any change of
beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to any other changes in this policy.
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 33 of 173

(The first clause of this provision, relative to the irrevocable designation
of beneficiary, may be omitted at the insurer’s option.)

Section 25:
§ 4030. OPTIONAL STANDARD POLICY PROVISIONS
Except as provided in section 4031 of this title, no health insurance policy
delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State shall contain
provisions respecting the matters set forth in this section unless the provisions
use the language set forth in this section; provided, however, that a health
insurer may, at its option, substitute different language approved by the
Commissioner for one or more provisions, provided the substituted language is
not less favorable in any respect to the insured or covered individual than the
language used in this section. Any provision set forth in this section that is
contained in the policy shall be preceded individually by the appropriate
caption appearing in this section or, at the option of the health insurer, by such
appropriate captions or subcaptions as the Commissioner may approve:
(1) CHANGE OF OCCUPATION: If the insured be injured or contract
sickness after having changed his or her occupation to one classified by the
insurer as more hazardous than that stated in this policy or while doing for
compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so classified, the insurer
will pay only such portion of the indemnities provided in this policy as the
premium paid would have purchased at the rates and within the limits fixed by
the insurer for such more hazardous occupation. If the insured changes his or
her occupation to one classified by the insurer as less hazardous than that
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 34 of 173
2025
stated in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of such change of
occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly, and will return the
excess pro rata unearned premium from the date of change of occupation or
from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of such proof,
whichever is the more recent. In applying this provision, the classification of
occupational risk and the premium rates shall be such as have been last filed by
the insurer prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable or
prior to date of proof of change in occupation with the state official having
supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided at the time this
policy was issued; but if such filing was not required, then the classification of
occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by
the insurer in such state prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the date
of proof of change in occupation.
(2) MISSTATEMENT OF AGE: If the age of the insured has been
misstated, all amounts payable under this policy shall be such as the premium
paid would have purchased at the correct age.
(3) OTHER INSURANCE IN THIS INSURER: If an accident or
sickness or accident and sickness policy or policies previously issued by the
insurer to the insured be in force concurrently herewith, making the aggregate
indemnity for .... (insert type of coverage or coverages) in excess of $
.................... (insert maximum limit of indemnity or indemnities) the excess
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 35 of 173
2025
insurance shall be void and all premiums paid for such excess shall be returned
to the insured or to his or her estate.
or, in lieu thereof:
Insurance effective at any one time on the insured under a like policy or
policies in this insurer is limited to the one such policy elected by the insured,
his or her beneficiary or his or her estate, as the case may be, and the insurer
will return all premiums paid for all other such policies.
(4) INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS: If there be other valid
coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a
provision of service basis or on an expense incurred basis and of which this
insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or
commencement of loss, the only liability under any expense incurred coverage
of this policy shall be for such proportion of the loss as the amount which
would otherwise have been payable hereunder plus the total of the like
amounts under all such other valid coverages for the same loss of which this
insurer had notice bears to the total like amounts under all valid coverages for
such loss, and for the return of such portion of the premiums paid as shall
exceed the pro rata portion for the amount so determined. For the purpose of
applying this provision when other coverage is on a provision of service basis,
the “like amount” of such other coverage shall be taken as the amount which
the services rendered would have cost in the absence of such coverage.
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 36 of 173
2025
(If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also
contains the next following policy provision there shall be added to the caption
of the foregoing provision the phrase “—EXPENSE INCURRED
BENEFITS.” The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a
definition of “other valid coverage,” approved as to form by the
Commissioner, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage
provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by
insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any
province of Canada, and by hospital or medical service organizations, and to
any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the
Commissioner. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include
group insurance, automobile medical payments insurance, or coverage
provided by hospital or medical service organizations or by union welfare
plans or employer or employee benefit organizations. For the purpose of
applying the foregoing policy provision with respect to any insured, any
amount of benefit provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory
benefit statute (including any workers’ compensation or employer’s liability
statute) whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise shall in all
cases be deemed to be “other valid coverage” of which the insurer has had
notice. In applying the foregoing policy provision no third party liability
coverage shall be included as “other valid coverage.”)
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 37 of 173
2025
(5) INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS: If there be other valid
coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on other
than an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given
written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only
liability for such benefits under this policy shall be for such proportion of the
indemnities otherwise provided hereunder for such loss as the like indemnities
of which the insurer had notice (including the indemnities under this policy)
bear to the total amount of all like indemnities for such loss, and for the return
of such portion of the premium paid as shall exceed the pro rata portion for the
indemnities thus determined.
(If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also
contains the next preceding policy provision there shall be added to the caption
of the foregoing provision the phrase “—OTHER BENEFITS.” The insurer
may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “other valid
coverage,” approved as to form by the Commissioner, which definition shall be
limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to
regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other
state of the United States or any province of Canada, and to any other coverage
the inclusion of which may be approved by the Commissioner. In the absence
of such definition such term shall not include group insurance, or benefits
provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit
organizations. For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy provision with
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 38 of 173
2025
respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such insured
pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers’
compensation or employer’s liability statute) whether provided by a
governmental agency or otherwise shall in all cases be deemed to be “other
valid coverage” of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing
policy provision no third party liability coverage shall be included as “other
valid coverage.”)
(6) RELATION OF EARNINGS TO INSURANCE: If the total monthly
amount of loss of time benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss
of time coverage upon the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly
basis, shall exceed the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability
commenced or his or her average monthly earnings for the period of two years
immediately preceding a disability for which claim is made, whichever is the
greater, the insurer will be liable only for such proportionate amount of such
benefits under this policy as the amount of such monthly earnings or such
average monthly earnings of the insured bears to the total amount of monthly
benefits for the same loss under all such coverage upon the insured at the time
such disability commences and for the return of such part of the premiums paid
during such two years as shall exceed the pro rata amount of the premiums for
the benefits actually paid hereunder; but this shall not operate to reduce the
total monthly amount of benefits payable under all such coverage upon the
insured below the sum of $200.00 or the sum of the monthly benefits specified
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 39 of 173
2025
in such coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to reduce
benefits other than those payable for loss of time.
(The foregoing policy provision may be inserted only in a policy which
the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely
payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50; or (2) in the case of a policy
issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue. The insurer
may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “valid loss of time
coverage,” approved as to form by the Commissioner, which definition shall be
limited in subject matter to coverage provided by governmental agencies or by
organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities
of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, or to
any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the
Commissioner or any combination of such coverages. In the absence of such
definition such term shall not include any coverage provided for such insured
pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers’
compensation or employer’s liability statute), or benefits provided by union
welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations.)
(7) UNPAID PREMIUM: Upon the payment of a claim under this policy,
any premium then due and unpaid or covered by any note or written order may
be deducted therefrom.
(8) CANCELLATION: The insurer may cancel this policy at any time by
written notice delivered to the insured, or mailed to his or her last address as
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 40 of 173
2025
shown by the records of the insurer, stating when, not less than five days
thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective; and after the policy has been
continued beyond its original term the insured may cancel this policy at any
time by written notice delivered or mailed to the insurer, effective upon receipt
or on such later date as may be specified in such notice. In the event of
cancellation, the insurer will return promptly the unearned portion of any
premium paid. If the insured cancels, the earned premium shall be computed
by the use of the short-rate table last filed with the state official having
supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided when the policy
was issued. If the insurer cancels, the earned premium shall be computed pro
rata. Cancellation shall be without prejudice to any claim originating prior to
the effective date of cancellation.
(9) CONFORMITY WITH STATE STATUTES: Any provision of this
policy which, on its effective date, is in conflict with the statutes of the state in
which the insured resides on such date is hereby amended to conform to the
minimum requirements of such statutes.
(10) ILLEGAL OCCUPATION: The insurer shall not be liable for any
loss to which a contributing cause was the insured’s commission of or attempt
to commit a felony or to which a contributing cause was the insured’s being
engaged in an illegal occupation.

Section 26:
§ 4031. OMISSION OF INAPPLICABLE OR INCONSISTENT
STANDARD PROVISIONS
If any provision of sections 4029 and 4030 of this title is in whole or in part
inapplicable to or inconsistent with the coverage provided by a particular form
of policy, the health insurer, with the approval of the Commissioner, shall omit
from such policy any inapplicable provision or part of a provision, and shall
modify any inconsistent provision or part of the provision in such manner as to
make the provision as contained in the policy consistent with the coverage
provided by the policy.

Section 27:
§ 4032. ORDER OF STANDARD POLICY PROVISIONS
The provisions specified in sections 4029 and 4030 of this title, or any
corresponding provisions used in lieu of those provisions as permitted by those

Section 28:
sections, shall either be printed in the same order as the provisions are set forth
in those sections or, at the option of the health insurer, any such provision may
appear as a unit in any part of the policy, with other provisions to which it may
be logically related, provided the resulting policy shall not be in whole or in
part unintelligible, uncertain, ambiguous, abstruse, or likely to mislead a
person to whom the policy is offered, delivered, or issued.

Section 29:
§ 4033. DISCRETIONARY CLAUSES PROHIBITED
(a) The purpose of this section is to ensure that health insurance benefits,
disability income protection coverage, and life insurance benefits are
contractually guaranteed and to avoid the conflict of interest that may occur
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 42 of 173
2025
when the carrier responsible for providing benefits has discretionary authority
to decide what benefits are due. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
impose any requirement or duty on any person other than a health insurer or a
health insurer offering disability income protection coverage or life insurance.
(b) As used in this section:
(1) “Disability income protection coverage” means a policy, contract,
certificate, or agreement that provides for weekly, monthly, or other periodic
payments for a specified period during the continuance of disability resulting
from illness, injury, or a combination of illness and injury.
(2) “Health insurer” has the same meaning as in section 4021 of this
chapter and, as used in this section, also includes entities offering policies for
specific disease, accident, injury, hospital indemnity, dental care, disability
income, long-term care, and other limited benefit coverage.
(3) “Life insurance” means a policy, contract, certificate, or agreement
that provides life insurance as defined in subdivision 3301(a)(1) of this title.
(c) No policy, contract, certificate, or agreement offered or issued in this
State by a health insurer to provide, deliver, arrange for, pay for, or reimburse
any of the costs of health care services may contain a provision purporting to
reserve discretion to the health insurer to interpret the terms of the contract or
to provide standards of interpretation or review that are inconsistent with the
laws of this State, and any such provision in a policy, contract, certificate, or
agreement shall be null and void.
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 43 of 173
2025
(d) No policy, contract, certificate, or agreement offered or issued in this
State providing for disability income protection coverage may contain a
provision purporting to reserve discretion to the insurer to interpret the terms
of the contract or to provide standards of interpretation or review that are
inconsistent with the laws of this State, and any such provision in a policy,
contract, certificate, or agreement shall be null and void.

PROVISIONS
(a) Terms and conditions. No group health insurance policy shall contain
any provision relating to notice of claim, proofs of loss, time of payment of
claims, or time within which legal action must be brought upon the policy that,
in the opinion of the Commissioner, is less favorable to the persons insured
than would be permitted by the provisions set forth in section 4029 of this title.
In addition, each such policy shall contain in substance the following
provisions:
(1) A provision that the policy; the application of the policyholder, if an
application or copy is attached to the policy; and the individual applications, if
any, submitted by the employees or members in connection with the policy
shall constitute the entire contract between the parties, and that all statements,
in the absence of fraud, made by any applicant or applicants shall be deemed
representations and not warranties, and that no such statement shall avoid the
insurance or reduce benefits under the policy unless contained in a written
application, of which a copy is attached to the policy.
(2) A provision that the health insurer will furnish to the policyholder,
for delivery to each employee or member of the insured group, an individual
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 52 of 173
2025
certificate setting forth in summary form a statement of the essential features
of the insurance coverage of the employee or member and to whom benefits
are payable under the policy. If dependents are included in the coverage, only
one certificate need be issued for each family unit.
(3) A provision that to the group originally insured may be added from
time to time eligible new employees or members or dependents, as the case
may be, in accordance with the terms of the policy.
(4) A provision that the health insurer shall not exclude part-time
employees and shall offer the same group health benefits to part-time
employees as it offers to the employee groups of which the part-time
employees would be members if they were full-time employees. The health
insurer shall offer to include the part-time employees as part of the employer’s
employee group, at the full rate to be paid by the employer and the employee,
at a rate prorated between the employer and the employee, or at the employee’s
expense. As used in this subdivision, “part-time employee” means any
employee who works a minimum of at least 17.5 hours per week.
(b) Protections for covered individuals.
(1) Preexisting condition exclusions. A group insurance policy shall not
contain any provision that excludes, restricts, or otherwise limits coverage
under the policy for one or more preexisting health conditions.
(2) Annual limitations on cost sharing.
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 53 of 173

coverage for any year shall be twice the dollar limit for self-only coverage
described in subdivision (i) of this subdivision (A).
(B)(i) In the event that the federal government does not establish an
annual limitation on cost sharing for any plan year, the annual limitation on
cost sharing for self-only coverage for that year shall be the dollar limit for
self-only coverage in the preceding calendar year, increased by any percentage
by which the average per capita premium for health insurance coverage in
Vermont for the preceding calendar year exceeds the average per capita
premium for the year before that.
(ii) The annual limitation on cost sharing for other than self-only
coverage for any year in which the federal government does not establish an
annual limitation on cost sharing shall be twice the dollar limit for self-only
coverage described in subdivision (i) of this subdivision (B).

not establish any annual or lifetime limit on the dollar amount of essential
health benefits, as defined in Section 1302(b) of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-148, as amended by the Health
VT LEG #383327 v.1

applicable regulations and federal guidance, for any individual insured under
the policy, regardless of whether the services are provided in-network or out-
of-network.

(A) A group insurance policy shall not impose any co-payment,
coinsurance, or deductible requirements for:
(i) preventive services that have an “A” or “B” rating in the
current recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force;
(ii) immunizations for routine use in children, adolescents, and
adults that have in effect a recommendation from the Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with
respect to the individual involved;

informed preventive care and screenings as set forth in comprehensive
guidelines supported by the federal Health Resources and Services

and screenings set forth in binding comprehensive health plan coverage
guidelines supported by the federal Health Resources and Services
Administration.

(2) The Commissioner shall adopt rules for standards and procedure for
permitting health insurers that issue Medicare supplement insurance policies to
use one or more risk classifications in their community rating method. The
premium charged shall not deviate from the community rate and the rules shall
not permit medical underwriting and screening, except that a health insurer
may set different community rates for persons eligible for Medicare by reason
of age and persons eligible for Medicare by reason of disability.
(b) Premium increases.
(1) Within five days after receiving a request for approval of any
composite average rate increase in excess of three percent, or any other
coverage changes that the Commissioner determines will have a comparable
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 66 of 173
2025
impact on cost or availability of coverage for a Medicare supplement insurance
policy issued by any health insurer with 5,000 or more total lives in the
Vermont Medicare supplement insurance market, the Commissioner shall
notify the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent Living of the
proposed premium increase. A composite average rate is the enrollment-
weighted average rate increase of all plans offered by a health insurer.
(2) Within five days after receiving notification pursuant to subdivision
(1) of this subsection, the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent
Living shall inform the members of the Advisory Board established pursuant to
33 V.S.A. § 505 of the proposed premium increase.
(3)(A) The Commissioner shall not approve any request to increase
Medicare supplement insurance premium rates unless the amount of the rate
increase complies with the statutory standards for approval under sections
4026, 4513, 4584, and 5104 of this title. Any approved rate increase shall not
be based on an unreasonable change in loss ratio from the previous year, unless
the Commissioner makes written findings that such change is necessary to
prevent a substantial adverse impact on the financial condition of the health
insurer. In acting on such rate increase requests, the Commissioner may deny
the request, approve the rate increase as requested, or approve a rate increase in
an amount different from the increase requested. A decision by the
Commissioner other than an approval of the rate requested may be appealed by
the health insurer, provided that the burden of proof shall be on the health
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 67 of 173
2025
insurer to show that the approved rate does not meet the statutory standards
established under this subsection.
(B) Before acting on the rate increase requested, the Commissioner
may make such examination or investigation as the Commissioner deems
necessary, including where applicable the review process set forth in
subdivision (C) of this subdivision (3).
(C)(i) In reviewing any Medicare supplement insurance rate increase
for which an independent analysis has been performed pursuant to 33 V.S.A.

Section 51:
§ 6706 and in which the health insurer’s requested composite average increase,
the independent expert’s recommended composite average rate increase, or the
Department actuary’s recommended composite average rate increase differ by
two percentage points or more, the Commissioner shall hold a public hearing at
which the health insurer, the Department’s actuary, the independent expert, any
intervenor, and the public will have the opportunity to present written and oral
testimony and will be available to answer questions of the Commissioner and
those present.
(ii) The hearing shall be noticed and held at a time and place so as
to facilitate public participation, and shall be recorded and become part of the
record before the Commissioner. At the Commissioner’s discretion, the
hearing may be conducted remotely.
(iii) If the carrier’s requested composite average increase, the
independent expert’s recommended composite average increase, or the
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 68 of 173
2025
Department actuary’s recommended composite average increase differs by less
than two percentage points, the Department and the parties shall confer by
conference call, or by any other available media, to review the rate requests
and recommendations. However, a public hearing may be held at the
Commissioner’s discretion for good cause shown.
(D)(i) In any review held in accordance with this subdivision (3), the
Commissioner shall permit intervention by any person whom the
Commissioner determines will materially advance the interests of the covered
individuals. The intervenor shall have access to and may use the information
of the independent expert appointed under 33 V.S.A. § 6706.
(ii) The reasonable and necessary cost of intervention as
determined by the Commissioner shall be paid by the affected policyholders or
certificate holders. The maximum payment shall be $2,500.00 except when
waived by the Commissioner for good cause shown. The $2,500.00 maximum
amount may be adjusted to reflect, at the Commissioner’s discretion,
appropriate inflation factors.
(E) Nonproprietary, relevant information in any Medicare
supplement insurance rate filing, including any analysis by the Department’s
actuary and the independent expert, shall be made available to the public upon
request.
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 69 of 173
2025
(c) Disability.
(1) A health insurer that issues Medicare supplement insurance policies
or certificates to a person eligible for Medicare by reason of age shall make
available, to persons eligible for Medicare by reason of disability, the same
policies or certificates that are offered and sold to persons eligible for
Medicare by reason of age. The initial enrollment period for any such policies
or certificates shall be at least six months following the date the individual
becomes eligible for Medicare by reason of disability. Any additional
enrollment periods as required by law and offered to individuals eligible by
reason of age shall be offered to individuals eligible by reason of disability.
(2) This subsection does not apply to persons eligible for Medicare by
reason of end stage renal disease.
(d) Outreach and education. The Department of Financial Regulation shall
collaborate with health insurers, advocates for older Vermonters and for other
Medicare-eligible adults, and the Office of the Health Care Advocate to
educate the public about the benefits and limitations of Medicare supplement
insurance policies and Medicare Advantage plans, including information to
help the public understand issues relating to coverage, costs, and provider
networks.

Section 52:
§ 4052. BLANKET HEALTH INSURANCE
(a) Blanket health insurance is a form of health insurance that, to the extent
permitted under federal law, is supplemental to major medical health insurance
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 70 of 173
2025
or provides coverage other than the payment of all or a portion of the cost of
health care services or products, and that covers special groups of persons as
follows:
(1) under a policy or contract issued to any common carrier, which shall
be deemed the policyholder, covering a group defined as all persons who may
become passengers on such common carrier;
(2) under a policy or contract issued to an employer, who shall be
deemed the policyholder, covering any group of employees defined by
reference to exceptional hazards incident to such employment;
(3) under a policy or contract issued to a public school, independent
school, or approved education program, as those terms are defined in
16 V.S.A. § 11; to a postsecondary school, as defined in 16 V.S.A.

Section 53:
§ 176(b)(1); or to a prequalified private prekindergarten provider, as defined in
16 V.S.A. § 829(a)(3), or to the head or principal of the school, program, or
provider, who or which shall be deemed the policyholder, covering students or
teachers, or both;
(4) under a policy or contract issued in the name of any volunteer fire
department, emergency medical services provider, or other such volunteer
group, which shall be deemed the policyholder, covering all of the members of
the department or group in connection with their department or group
activities; or
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 71 of 173
2025
(5) under a policy or contract issued to any other substantially similar
group that, in the discretion of the Commissioner and after the prior approval
by the Commissioner of the group, may be subject to the issuance of a blanket
health policy or contract.
(b)(1) No blanket health insurance policy shall contain any provision
relating to notice of claim, proofs of loss, time of payment of claims, or time
within which legal action must be brought upon the policy that, in the opinion
of the Commissioner, is less favorable to the persons insured than would be
permitted by the provisions set forth in section 4029 of this title.
(2) An individual application shall not be required from a person
covered under a blanket health policy or contract, nor shall it be necessary for
the insurer to furnish each person a certificate.
(3) All benefits under any blanket health policy shall, unless for hospital
and physician service or surgical benefits, be payable to the person insured, or
to the person’s designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to the person’s
estate, except that if the person insured is a minor, the benefits may be made
payable to the minor’s parent, guardian, or other person actually supporting the
minor.
(4) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the legal liability of
policyholders for the death of, or injury to, any members of the group.
(c) No blanket health insurance policy that provides coverage for the
payment of all or a portion of the cost of health care services or products shall
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 72 of 173
2025
contain any provision that does not comply with a requirement of this title, or a
rule adopted pursuant to this title applicable to health insurance, other than
those requirements applicable to nongroup health insurance or small group
health insurance. The Commissioner may waive the application to a blanket
insurance policy of one or more of the health insurance requirements of this
title, or a rule adopted pursuant to this title, if the requirement is not relevant to
the types of risks and duration of risks insured against in the blanket insurance
policy.

Section 54:
§ 4053. SHORT-TERM, LIMITED-DURATION HEALTH INSURANCE
(a) As used in this section, “short-term, limited-duration health insurance”
means health insurance that provides medical, hospital, or major medical
expense benefits coverage pursuant to a policy or contract with a health insurer
and that has an expiration date specified in the policy or contract that is three
months or less after the original effective date of the policy or contract.
(b) No person shall provide short-term, limited-duration health insurance
coverage without a certificate of authority from the Commissioner to offer
health insurance in this State unless the person is exempted by subdivision

(c) A short-term, limited-duration health insurance policy or contract shall
be nonrenewable, and a health insurer shall not issue a short-term, limited-
duration health insurance policy or contract to any person if the issuance would
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 73 of 173
2025
result in the person being covered by short-term, limited-duration health
insurance coverage for more than three months in any 12-month period.
(d) A policy or contract for short-term, limited-duration health insurance
coverage shall display prominently in the policy or contract and in any
application materials provided in connection with enrollment in that coverage,
in at least 14-point type, certain disclosures regarding the scope of short-term,
limited-duration health insurance coverage, including the types of benefits and
consumer protections that are and are not included. The Commissioner shall
determine the specific disclosure language that shall be used in all short-term,
limited-duration health insurance policies, contracts, and application materials
and shall provide the language to the health insurers offering that coverage.
(e) The Commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to 3 V.S.A. chapter 25:
(1) establishing the minimum financial, marketing, service, and other
requirements for registration of a health insurer to provide short-term, limited-
duration health insurance coverage to individuals in this State;
(2) requiring a health insurer seeking to provide short-term, limited-
duration health insurance coverage to individuals in this State to file its rates

coverage of injury, sickness, and necessary care and treatment of medically
diagnosed congenital defect or birth abnormality.
(2) Coverage for a newly born child shall be provided without notice or
additional premium for not less than 60 days after the date of birth. If payment
of a specific premium or subscription fee is required in order to have the
coverage continue beyond such 60-day period, the policy may require that
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 75 of 173
2025
notification of the birth of the newly born child and payment of the required
premium or fees be furnished to the health insurer within a period of not less
than 60 days after the date of birth.
(c) Adopted child coverage.
(1) As used in this section:
(A) “Child” means, in connection with any adoption or placement for
adoption of the child, an individual who has not attained 18 years of age as of
the date of the adoption or placement for adoption.
(B) “Placement for adoption” means the assumption and retention by
a person of a legal obligation for total or partial support of a child in
anticipation of the adoption of the child. The child’s placement with a person
terminates upon the termination of such legal obligations.
(2) In any case in which a health insurance plan provides coverage for
dependent children of covered individuals, the plan shall provide benefits to
dependent children placed with covered individuals for adoption under the
same terms and conditions as apply to the natural, dependent children of the
covered individuals, irrespective of whether the adoption has become final.
(3) A health insurance plan shall not restrict coverage under the plan of
any dependent child adopted by a covered individual, or placed with a covered
individual for adoption, solely on the basis of a preexisting condition of the
child at the time that the child would otherwise become eligible for coverage
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 76 of 173
2025
under the plan, if the adoption or placement for adoption occurs while the
covered individual is eligible for coverage under the plan.
(d) Coverage required until 26 years of age. A health insurance plan that
provides dependent coverage of children shall continue to make that coverage
available for an adult child until the child attains 26 years of age, provided that
this subsection shall not apply to a plan providing coverage for a specified
disease or other limited benefit coverage, and further provided that nothing in
this subsection shall require a plan to make coverage available for the child of
a child receiving dependent coverage.
(e) Coverage of adult child with a disability.
(1) A health insurance plan that provides for terminating the coverage of
a dependent child upon attainment of the limiting age for dependent children
specified in the policy shall not limit or restrict coverage with respect to an
unmarried child who meets all of the following criteria:
(A) is incapable of self-sustaining employment by reason of a mental
or physical disability that has been found to be a disability that qualifies or
would qualify the child for benefits using the definitions, standards, and
methodology in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P;
(B) became so incapable prior to attainment of the limiting age; and
(C) is chiefly dependent upon the employee, member, subscriber, or
policyholder for support and maintenance.

any person based upon the existence of such a condition; provided, however,
that a health insurance plan may require reasonable periodic proof of a
continuing condition not more frequently than once every year.
(f) Coverage of leave of absence from college. A health insurance plan that
covers dependent children who are full-time college students beyond 18 years
of age shall include coverage for a dependent’s medically necessary leave of
absence from school for a period not to exceed 24 months or the date on which
coverage would otherwise end pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
policy or coverage, whichever comes first, except that coverage may continue
under subsection (b) of this section as appropriate. To establish entitlement to
coverage under this subsection, documentation and certification by the
student’s treating health care professional of the medical necessity of a leave of
absence shall be submitted to the health insurer or, for self-insured plans, the
health plan administrator. The health insurance plan may require reasonable
periodic proof from the student’s treating health care professional that the
leave of absence continues to be medically necessary.
(g) Parental rights. When a child has health coverage through the health
insurer of a parent, the health insurer shall:
(1) provide such information to either parent as may be necessary for the
child to obtain benefits through that coverage;
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 78 of 173
2025
(2) permit either parent, a provider with parental authorization, the State
Medicaid agency as assignee, or any State agency administering health benefits
or a health benefit plan for which Medicaid is a source of funding to submit
claims for covered services, and to appeal the denial of any benefit, without the
approval of the other parent; and
(3) make payments on claims submitted in accordance with subdivision
(2) of this subsection directly to the parent who paid the provider, the provider
as assignee, the State Medicaid agency, or any State agency administering
health benefits or a health benefit plan for which Medicaid is a source of
funding.

No. 11 Page 79 of 173
2025

(2) the child is not claimed as a dependent on the parent’s federal tax
return; or
(3) the child does not reside with the parent or in the health insurer’s
service area.
(c) When a parent is required by a court or administrative order to provide
health coverage for a child, and the parent is eligible for dependent health
coverage, the health insurer shall be required:
(1) To enroll, under the dependent coverage, a child who is otherwise
eligible for the coverage without regard to any enrollment season restrictions
or any seasonal restrictions on switching from one plan to another, upon
application of either parent, the employer, the State agency administering the
Medicaid program, any State agency administering health benefits or a health
insurance plan for which Medicaid is a source of funding, or the child support
enforcement program.
(2) Not to disenroll or eliminate coverage of the child unless the health
insurer is provided satisfactory written evidence that:
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 80 of 173
2025
(A) the court or administrative order is no longer in effect;
(B) the child is or will be enrolled in comparable health coverage
through another health insurer that will take effect not later than the effective

its employees if allowed by law.

coverage effective three days after the mailing of notice of the court or
administrative order to the health insurer or upon actual receipt of notice by the
health insurer, whichever is sooner. The health insurer shall have 10 days from
notice to process the enrollment and shall be entitled to premiums from the
effective date of enrollment.
(d) A health insurer shall not impose requirements on a State agency that
has been assigned the rights of an individual eligible for medical assistance
under Medicaid and covered for health benefits from the health insurer that are
different from requirements applicable to an agent or assignee of any other
individual so covered.
(e) Any health insurer that fails to enroll a child after notice under
15 V.S.A. § 663(d) or 33 V.S.A. § 4110(a)(4) shall be directly liable for any
medical expenses of the child that would have been covered under the health
insurance plan had the health insurer enrolled the child upon receiving notice.
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 81 of 173
2025
(f) Notice by first class mail, postage prepaid, or by any other method
showing actual receipt, shall be presumptive evidence of its receipt by the
health insurer to whom it is addressed. Any period of time that is determined
under this section by the giving of notice shall commence to run from the date
of mailing, if the notice is mailed, or the date of actual receipt if another
method of transmitting the notice is used.
(g) A health insurer may cancel any health insurance plan that is the subject
of a medical support order for nonpayment of premium only if the health
insurer mails or delivers notice of cancellation to both parents and all other
persons or agencies identified in the medical support order. Any health insurer
cancelling a health insurance plan for nonpayment of premium shall reinstate
the health insurance plan effective from the date of cancellation if the
nonpayment of premium is cured within 45 days of the cancellation.

this section.
(b) A covered individual who has exhausted all applicable internal review
procedures provided by the health insurance plan shall have the right to an
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 83 of 173
2025
independent external review of a decision under a health insurance plan to
deny, reduce, or terminate health care coverage or to deny payment for a health
care service. The independent review shall be available when requested in
writing by the affected covered individual, provided the decision to be
reviewed requires the plan to expend at least $100.00 for the service and the
decision by the plan is based on one of the following reasons:
(1) The health care service is a covered benefit that the health insurer
has determined to be not medically necessary.
(2) A limitation is placed on the selection of a health care provider that
is claimed by the covered individual to be inconsistent with limits imposed by
the health insurance plan and any applicable laws and rules.
(3) The health care treatment has been determined to be experimental or
investigational or is an off-label drug. A health insurance plan that denies use
of a prescription drug for the treatment of cancer as not medically necessary or
as an experimental or investigational use shall treat any internal appeal of such
denial as an emergency or urgent appeal and shall decide the appeal within the
time frames applicable to emergency and urgent internal appeals under rules
adopted by the Commissioner.
(4) The health care service involves a medically based decision that a
condition is preexisting.
(5) The decision involves an adverse determination related to surprise
medical billing, as established under Section 2799A-1 or 2799A-2 of the
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 84 of 173
2025
Public Health Service Act, including with respect to whether an item or service
that is the subject of the adverse determination is an item or service to which

Section 62:
Section 2799A-1 or 2799A-2 of the Public Health Service Act, or both,
applies.
(c) The right to review under this section shall not be construed to change
the terms of coverage under a health insurance plan.
(d) The Department shall adopt rules necessary to carry out the purposes of
this section. The rules shall ensure that the independent external reviews have
the following characteristics:
(1) The independent external reviews shall be conducted:
(A) by independent review organizations pursuant to a contract with
the Department, and the reviewers shall include health care providers
credentialed with respect to the health care service under review and shall have
no conflict of interest relating to the performance of their duties under this

Section 63:
section; and
(B) in accordance with standards of decision making based on
objective clinical evidence, shall resolve all issues in a timely manner, and
shall provide expedited resolution when the decision relates to emergency or
urgent health care services.
(2) A covered individual shall:
(A) Be provided with adequate notice of the covered individual’s
review rights under this section.
VT LEG #383327 v.1
No. 11 Page 85 of 173
2025
(B) Have the right to use outside assistance during the review process
and to submit evidence relating to the health care service.
(C) Pay an application fee of $25.00 for each request for an
independent external review of an appealable decision not to exceed a total of
$75.00 annually. The application fee may be waived or reduced based on a
determination by the Commissioner that the financial circumstances of the
covered individual warrant a waiver or reduction. The application fee shall be
paid by the health insurer, not the covered individual, if the independent
review organization reverses the health insurer’s decision to deny payment for
a health care service.
(D) Be protected from retaliation for exercising the covered
individual’s right to an independent external review under this section.
(3) Other costs of the independent review shall be paid by the health
insurance plan.
(4) The independent review organization shall issue to both parties a
written review decision that is evidence-based. The decision shall be binding
on the health insurance plan.
(5) The confidentiality of any health care information acquired or
provided to the independent review organization shall be maintained in
compliance with any applicable State or federal laws.

(6) The records of, and internal materials prepared for, specific reviews
by any independent review organization under this section shall be exempt
from public inspection and copying under the Public Records Act.
(e) Decisions relating to the following health care services shall not be
reviewed under this section but shall be reviewed by the review process
provided by law:
(1) health care services provided by the Vermont Medicaid program or
Medicaid benefits provided through a contracted health plan; and
(2) health care services provided to incarcerated individuals by the
Department of Corrections.

services of the originating site health care provider or of the distant site health
care provider, but not both.

limiting in any way the covered individual’s ability to receive additional
covered in-person services from the same or a different health care provider for
diagnosis or treatment of the same condition.
(h) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a health insurance
plan to reimburse the distant site health care provider if the distant site health
care provider has insufficient information to render an opinion.

management of the benefit consistent with variations in practice patterns and
treatment modalities among different types of health care professionals.

2025
amounts, limits, and review shall not function to direct treatment in a manner
unfairly discriminative against athletic trainer care, and collectively shall be
not more restrictive than those applicable under the same policy for care or
services provided by other health care professionals but allowing for the
management of the benefit consistent with variations in practice patterns and
treatment modalities among different types of health care professionals.
(c) A health insurer may require that the athletic trainer services be

(2) “Health care services” means services for the diagnosis, prevention,
treatment, cure, or relief of a health condition, illness, injury, or disease.
(3) “Health insurance plan” means a policy or contract issued by a
health insurer, including the health benefit plan or plans offered by the State of
Vermont to its employees and any health benefit plan offered by any agency or
instrumentality of the State to its employees. Unless otherwise specified,
“health insurance” does not include Vermont Medicaid.
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 2 of 173
2025
(4) “Health insurer” means an insurance company that provides health
insurance as defined in subdivision 3301(a)(2) of this title, a nonprofit hospital
or medical service corporation, a managed care organization, a health
maintenance organization, and, to the extent permitted under federal law, any
administrator of an insured, self-insured, or publicly funded health care benefit
plan offered by a public or private entity.
(5) “Major medical insurance” means a comprehensive health insurance
plan that is not specific disease, accident, hospital indemnity, dental care,
vision care, disability income, long-term care, Medicare supplement insurance,
or other limited-benefit coverage. The term does not include short-term,
limited-duration health insurance coverage or a plan under which benefits are
paid directly to a covered individual or the individual’s assigns and for which
the amount of the benefit is not based on potential medical costs or on actual
costs incurred.
§ 4012. COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL LAW
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this title, health insurers, hospital and
medical service corporations, and health maintenance organizations that issue,
sell, renew, or offer health insurance plans in Vermont shall comply with the
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996, as amended from time to time (42 U.S.C. Chapter 6A, Subchapter
XXV), and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, Pub. L.
No. 111-148, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 3 of 173
2025
of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-152. The Commissioner shall enforce such
requirements pursuant to the Commissioner’s authority under this title.
(b)(1) Health insurers, hospital and medical service corporations, health
maintenance organizations, and health care providers, as that term is defined in
18 V.S.A. § 9432, shall comply with the requirements of the No Surprises Act,
Pub. L. No. 116-260, Division BB, Title I, as amended from time to time.
(2) The Commissioner shall enforce the requirements of the No
Surprises Act as they apply to health insurers, hospital and medical service
corporations, health maintenance organizations, and health care providers, to
the extent permitted under federal law, pursuant to the Commissioner’s
authority under this title. The Commissioner may also refer cases of
noncompliance to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under
the terms of a collaborative enforcement agreement, or to the Office of the
Vermont Attorney General.
§ 4013. DISCRIMINATION PROHIBITED
No health insurer shall make or permit any unfair discrimination between
individuals of substantially the same hazard in the amount of premium rates
charged for any health insurance plan or in the benefits payable under the plan;
provided, however, that this section shall not be construed to prohibit different
premium rates, different benefits, or different underwriting procedure for
individuals insured under group, family expense, or blanket plans of insurance.
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 4 of 173

§ 4014. ADVERTISING PRACTICES
(a) No company doing business in this State, and no insurance agent or
broker, shall use in connection with the solicitation of health insurance or
pharmacy benefit management any advertising copy or advertising practice or
any plan of solicitation that is materially misleading or deceptive. An
advertising copy or advertising practice or plan of solicitation shall be
considered to be materially misleading or deceptive if by implication or
otherwise it transmits information in such manner or of such substance that a
prospective applicant for health insurance may be misled by it to the
applicant’s material damage.
(b)(1) If the Commissioner finds that any such advertising copy or
advertising practice or plan of solicitation is materially misleading or
deceptive, the Commissioner shall order the company or the agent or broker
using such copy or practice or plan to cease and desist from such use.
(2) Before making any such finding and order, the Commissioner shall
give notice, not less than 10 days in advance, and a hearing to the company,
agent, or broker affected.
(3) If the Commissioner finds, after due notice and hearing, that any
authorized insurer, licensed pharmacy benefit manager, licensed insurance
agent, or licensed insurance broker has intentionally violated any such order to
cease and desist, the Commissioner may suspend or revoke the license of such
insurer, pharmacy benefit manager, agent, or broker.
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 5 of 173
2025
§ 4015. PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS
The Commissioner may impose an administrative penalty of up to $750.00
on any person who intentionally violates any provision of this chapter or any
order of the Commissioner made in accordance with this chapter. The
Commissioner may also suspend or revoke the license of a health insurer or
agent for any such intentional violation.
§ 4016. APPEAL
(a) Any person aggrieved by any action of the Commissioner may obtain a
review by appeal to the Superior Court of Washington County. The appeal
shall be based on the record of the proceedings before the Commissioner and
shall not be limited to questions of law. If the appeal is from an order of the
Commissioner, the order shall not take effect during the pendency of the
appeal unless the court determines otherwise.
(b) The court may review all the facts and in disposing of any issue before
it may modify, affirm, or reverse any order of the Commissioner in whole or in
part.
(c) Either party may appeal from the decision of the Superior Court to the
Supreme Court in the manner provided by law.
§ 4017. EXEMPTION FROM ATTACHMENT AND TRUSTEE PROCESS
So much of any benefits under all policies of health insurance as does not
exceed $200.00 for each month during any period of disability covered by the
policy shall not be liable to attachment, trustee process, or other process, or to
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 6 of 173
2025
be seized, taken, appropriated, or applied by any legal or equitable process or
by operation of law, either before or after payment of such benefits, to pay any
debt or liabilities of the person insured under the policy. However, this
exemption shall not apply where an action is brought to recover for necessaries
contracted for during the period of disability and the writ or bill of complaint
contains a statement to that effect. When a policy provides for a lump sum
payment because of a dismemberment or other loss insured, the payment shall
be exempt from execution of the covered individual’s creditors.
§ 4018. THIRD-PARTY OWNERSHIP
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as preventing a person other than
the covered individual with proper insurable interest from making application
for and owning a policy covering the covered individual or from being entitled
under such a policy to any indemnities, benefits, and rights provided in the
policy.
§ 4019. NOTICE AS WAIVER
A health insurer shall not be deemed to have waived any rights to defend a
claim under a health insurance plan based solely on the health insurer’s
acknowledgement of receipt of notice under the plan, furnishing or accepting
forms for filing proof of loss under the plan, or investigating any claim of loss
under the plan.
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 7 of 173
2025
§ 4020. AGE LIMITS
(a) If a health insurance plan contains a provision establishing, as an age
limit or otherwise, a date after which the coverage provided by the plan will
not be effective, and if that date falls within a period for which the health
insurer has accepted a premium or if the health insurer accepts a premium after
that date, the coverage provided by the plan shall continue in force subject to
any right of cancellation until the end of the period for which a premium has
been accepted.
(b) Notwithstanding any provision of subsection (a) of this section to the
contrary, if the age of the covered individual has been misstated and if,
according to the correct age of the covered individual, the coverage provided
by the policy would not have become effective or would have ceased prior to
the health insurer’s acceptance of the premium or premiums, then the health
insurer’s liability shall be limited to the refund, upon request, of all premiums
paid for the period not covered by the plan.
§ 4021. TERMINATION OF COVERAGE
(a)(1) A major medical insurance policy issued by a health insurer that
insures employees, members, or subscribers for hospital and medical insurance
on an expense-incurred, service, or prepaid basis shall:
(A) provide notice to the policyholder or other responsible party of
any premium payment due on a policy at least 21 days before the due date; and
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 8 of 173
2025
(B) provide a grace period of at least one month for the payment of
each premium falling due after the first premium, during which grace period
the plan shall continue in force and the issuer of the plan shall be liable for
valid claims for covered losses incurred prior to the end of the grace period.
(2) If the issuer of a plan described subdivision (1) of this subsection
does not receive payment by the due date, the issuer shall send a termination
notice to the policyholder at least 21 days prior to termination notifying the
policyholder that the issuer may terminate the plan if payment is not received
by the termination date.
(3) The termination date of a plan described in subdivision (1) of this
subsection shall not be earlier than the day following the last day of the grace
period set forth in subdivision (1)(A) of this subsection.
(b) For all health insurance policies other than major medical insurance
policies, a health insurer shall notify a policyholder of any premium payment
due on a policy at least 21 days before the due date. If a health insurer does
not receive payment by the due date, the health insurer shall send a termination
notice to the policyholder notifying the policyholder that the health insurer will
terminate the policy effective on the due date if payment is not received within
14 days from the date of mailing of the termination notice. If a health insurer
does not receive payment within 14 days from the date of mailing of the
termination notice, the health insurer may cancel coverage effective on the due
date.

accrue under any health insurance plan issued pursuant 33 V.S.A. § 1811, or

additional commission, fee, or other compensation outside insurance rates or
from compensating agents, brokers, or other individuals through the

not exceeding six percent per annum, in payment of any premium.

directly or indirectly, to a licensed or unlicensed agent, broker, or other
individual other than a bona fide employee of the health insurer in connection
with the sale of a group insurance policy shall clearly disclose to the purchaser
of the policy the amount of any such commission, fee, or compensation paid or
to be paid.
§ 4023. PROVISIONS APPLYING TO POLICIES DELIVERED IN
ANOTHER STATE

delivery to a person residing in another state, and if the official having

disapproval by the official, the Commissioner may issue an order requiring that
the policy meet the standards set forth in sections 4029, 4030, and 4031 of this
title.
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 14 of 173

MEDICAID AND COMPLIANCE WITH MEDICAID RECOVERY
PROVISIONS

(a)(1) No policy of health insurance or certificate under a policy filed by a
health insurer and not exempted by subdivision 3368(a)(4) of this title shall be
delivered or issued for delivery in this State, nor shall any endorsement, rider,
or application that becomes a part of any such policy be used, until a copy of
the form and of the rules for the classification of risks has been filed with the
Department of Financial Regulation and a copy of the premium rates has been
filed with the Green Mountain Care Board, and the Green Mountain Care
Board has issued a decision approving, modifying, or disapproving the
proposed rate.
(2)(A) The Green Mountain Care Board shall review rate requests and
shall approve, modify, or disapprove a rate request within 90 calendar days
after receipt of an initial rate filing from a health insurer. If a health insurer
fails to provide necessary materials or other information to the Board in a
timely manner, the Board may extend its review for a reasonable additional
period of time, not to exceed 30 calendar days.
(B) Prior to the Board’s decision on a rate request, the Department of
Financial Regulation shall provide the Board with an analysis and opinion on
the impact of the proposed rate on the insurer’s solvency and reserves.
(3) The Board shall determine whether a rate is affordable; promotes
quality care; promotes access to health care; protects insurer solvency; and is
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 16 of 173
2025
not unjust, unfair, inequitable, misleading, or contrary to the laws of this State.
In making this determination, the Board shall consider the analysis and opinion
provided by the Department of Financial Regulation pursuant to subdivision
(2)(B) of this subsection.
(b)(1) In conjunction with a rate filing required by subsection (a) of this
section, a health insurer shall file a plain language summary of the proposed

and Human Services (HHS) requires for rate increases over 10 percent, and
any other information required by the Board. The plain language summary
shall be in the format required by the Secretary of HHS pursuant to the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-148, as amended
by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, Pub. L. No.

per-month costs for prescription drugs compared to other components of the
premium rate; and
(ii) the specialty tier formulary list.
(B) The insurer shall provide, if available, the percentage of the
premium rate attributable to prescription drugs administered by a health care
provider in an outpatient setting that are part of the medical benefit as separate
from the pharmacy benefit.
(C) The insurer shall include information on its use of a pharmacy
benefit manager, if any, including which components of the prescription drug
coverage described in subdivisions (A) and (B) of this subdivision (2) are
managed by the pharmacy benefit manager, as well as the name of the
pharmacy benefit manager or managers used.
(3)(A) Upon request, in conjunction with a rate filing required by
subsection (a) of this section, a health insurer shall provide to the Board
detailed information about the insurer’s payments to specific providers, which
VT LEG #383327 v.1

(c)(1) The Board shall provide information to the public on the Board’s
website about the public availability of the filings and summaries required

also establish a mechanism by which members of the public may request to be
notified automatically each time a proposed rate is filed with the Board.

to comment on all rate filings. The Board shall accept public comment on each

subsection, the Office of the Health Care Advocate established in 18 V.S.A.
chapter 229, acting on behalf of health insurance consumers in this State, may,

regarding the filing for the Board to provide to its contracting actuary, if any.
(B) The Office of the Health Care Advocate may also submit to the
Board written comments on a health insurer’s rate request. The Board shall

(2) at a public hearing, announce the Board’s decision of whether to
approve, modify, or disapprove the proposed rate; and
(3) issue its decision in writing.
(f)(1) The insurer shall notify its policyholders of the Board’s decision in a
timely manner, as defined by the Board by rule.
(2) Rates shall take effect on the date specified in the insurer’s rate
filing.

(3) If the Board has not issued its decision by the effective date specified
in the insurer’s rate filing, the insurer shall notify its policyholders of its
pending rate request and of the effective date proposed by the insurer in its rate
filing.
(g) A health insurer, the Office of the Health Care Advocate, and any
member of the public with party status, as defined by the Board by rule, may
appeal a decision of the Board approving, modifying, or disapproving the
insurer’s proposed rate to the Vermont Supreme Court.
(h)(1) The authority of the Board under this section shall apply only to the
rate review process for policies for major medical insurance coverage and shall
not apply to the policy forms for major medical insurance coverage or to the
rate and policy form review process for policies for specific disease, accident,
injury, hospital indemnity, dental care, vision care, disability income, long-
term care, student health insurance coverage, Medicare supplement insurance
coverage, or other limited benefit coverage; to short-term, limited-duration
health insurance coverage; or to benefit plans that are paid directly to an
individual insured or to the individual’s assigns and for which the amount of
the benefit is not based on potential medical costs or actual costs incurred.
Premium rates and rules for the classification of risk for Medicare supplement
insurance policies shall be governed by section 4051 of this title.
(2) The policy forms for major medical insurance coverage, as well as
the policy forms, premium rates, and rules for the classification of risk for the
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 22 of 173
2025
other lines of insurance described in subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be
reviewed and approved or disapproved by the Commissioner. In making a
determination, the Commissioner shall consider whether a policy form,
premium rate, or rule is affordable and is not unjust, unfair, inequitable,
misleading, or contrary to the laws of this State; and, for a policy form for
major medical insurance coverage, whether it ensures equal access to
appropriate mental health care in a manner equivalent to other aspects of health
care as part of an integrated, holistic system of care. The Commissioner shall
make a determination within 30 days after the date the insurer filed the policy
form, premium rate, or rule with the Department. At the expiration of the 30-
day period, the form, premium rate, or rule shall be deemed approved unless
prior to then it has been affirmatively approved or disapproved by the
Commissioner or found to be incomplete. The Commissioner shall notify a
health insurer in writing if the insurer files any form, premium rate, or rule
containing a provision that does not meet the standards expressed in this
subsection. In such notice, the Commissioner shall state that a hearing will be
granted within 20 days upon the insurer’s written request.
(i) Notwithstanding the procedures and timelines set forth in subsections
(a) through (e) of this section, the Board may establish, by rule, a streamlined
rate review process for certain rate decisions, including proposed rates
affecting fewer than a minimum number of covered lives and proposed rates
for which a de minimis increase, as defined by the Board by rule, is sought.

§ 4027. FILING FEES
Each filing of a policy, contract, or document form or premium rates or
rules, submitted pursuant to section 4026 of this title, shall be accompanied by
payment to the Commissioner or the Green Mountain Care Board, as
appropriate, of a nonrefundable fee of $150.00.
§ 4028. FORM AND CONTENTS OF POLICY
No policy of individual health insurance shall be delivered or issued for
delivery to any person in this State unless all of the following conditions are
met:
(1) The policy sets forth all of the monetary and other considerations for
the policy.
(2) The policy sets forth the time at which the insurance takes effect and
terminates.
(3) The policy purports to insure only one person, except that a policy
may insure, originally or by subsequent amendment, upon the application of an
adult member of a family who shall be deemed the policyholder, any two or
more eligible members of that family, including a spouse or civil union
partner, dependent children or any children under a specified age that shall not
exceed 26 years of age, and any other person dependent upon the policyholder.
(4) The style, arrangement, and overall appearance of the policy give no
undue prominence to any portion of the text, and every printed portion of the
text of the policy and of any endorsements or attached papers is plainly printed
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 24 of 173
2025
in light-faced type of a style in general use, the size of which shall be uniform
and not less than 10-point with a lowercase unspaced alphabet length not less
than 120-point. As used in this subdivision, the “text” includes all printed
matter except the name and address of the insurer; the name or title of the
policy; the brief description, if any; and the captions and subcaptions.
(5) The exceptions and reductions of indemnity are set forth in the
policy and, except those that are set forth in sections 4029 and 4030 of this
title, are printed, at the insurer’s option, either with the benefit provision to
which they apply or under an appropriate caption such as “EXCEPTIONS” or
“EXCEPTIONS AND REDUCTIONS”; provided, however, that if an
exception or reduction specifically applies only to a particular benefit of the
policy, the statement of the exception or reduction shall be included with the
benefit provision to which it applies.
(6) Each policy form, including riders and endorsements, is identified by
a form number in the lower left-hand corner of the first page of the form.
(7) The policy does not contain any provision purporting to make any
portion of the charter, rules, constitution, or bylaws of the health insurer a part
of the policy unless that portion is set forth in full in the policy, except in the
case of the incorporation of, or reference to, a statement of rates or
classification of risks or a short-rate table filed with the Commissioner.
(8) Either prominently printed on or attached to the first page of the
policy is a notice to the effect that during a period of 30 days following the
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 25 of 173
2025
date the policy is delivered to persons eligible for Medicare by reason of age,
and 10 days following the date of delivery to all other persons, the policy may
be surrendered to the insurer together with a written request for cancellation of
the policy, and that in such event, the insurer will refund any premium paid,
including any policy fees or other charges; provided, however, that this
subdivision shall not apply to single premium nonrenewable policies insuring
against accident only or medical costs or accidental bodily injury only.
§ 4029. REQUIRED STANDARD POLICY PROVISIONS
Except as provided in section 4031 of this title, each health insurance policy
delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State shall contain the
provisions specified in this section using the language set forth in this section;
provided, however, that a health insurer may, at its option, substitute different
language approved by the Commissioner for one or more provisions, provided
the substituted language is not less favorable in any respect to the insured or
covered individual than the language used in this section. The provisions
specified in this section shall be preceded individually by the caption appearing
in this section or, at the option of the health insurer, by such appropriate
captions or subcaptions as the Commissioner may approve:
(1) ENTIRE CONTRACT; CHANGES: This policy, including the
endorsements and the attached papers, if any, constitutes the entire contract of
insurance. No change in this policy shall be valid until approved by an
executive officer of the insurer and unless such approval be endorsed hereon or
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 26 of 173
2025
attached hereto. No agent has authority to change this policy or to waive any
of its provisions.
(2) TIME LIMIT ON CERTAIN DEFENSES: (a) After three years
from the date of issue of this policy no misstatements, except fraudulent
misstatements, made by the applicant in the application for such policy, shall
be used to void the policy or to deny a claim for loss incurred or disability (as
defined in the policy) commencing after the expiration of such three-year
period.
(The foregoing policy provision shall not be so construed as to affect any
legal requirement for avoidance of a policy or denial of a claim during such
initial three-year period, nor to limit the application of subdivisions 4030(1)–
(5) of this title in the event of misstatement with respect to age or occupation
or other insurance.) (A policy which the insured has the right to continue in
force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premium (1) until at least
age 50, or (2) in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years
from its date of issue, may contain in lieu of the foregoing the following
provision (from which the clause in parentheses may be omitted at the
insurer’s option) under the caption “INCONTESTABLE”:
After this policy has been in force for a period of three years during the
lifetime of the insured (excluding any period during which the insured is
disabled), it shall become incontestable as to the statements contained in the
application.)
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 27 of 173
2025
(b) No claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy)
commencing after three years from the date of issue of this policy shall be
reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition not
excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective on the date
of loss had existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this policy.
(3) GRACE PERIOD: A grace period of . . . . (insert a number not less
than “7” for weekly premium policies, “10” for monthly premium policies and
“31” for all other policies) days will be granted for the payment of each
premium falling due after the first premium, during which grace period the
policy shall continue in force.
(A policy which contains a cancellation provision may add, at the end of
the above provision,
subject to the right of the insurer to cancel in accordance with the
cancellation provision hereof,
A policy in which the insurer reserves the right to refuse any renewal
shall have, at the beginning of the above provision,
Unless not less than five days prior to the premium due date the insurer has
delivered to the insured or has mailed to his or her last address as shown by the
records of the insurer written notice of its intention not to renew this policy
beyond the period for which the premium has been accepted.)
(4) REINSTATEMENT: If any renewal premium be not paid within the
time granted the insured for payment, a subsequent acceptance of premium by
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 28 of 173
2025
the insurer or by any agent duly authorized by the insurer to accept such
premium, without requiring in connection therewith an application for
reinstatement, shall reinstate the policy; provided, however, that if the insurer
or such agent requires an application for reinstatement and issues a conditional
receipt for the premium tendered, the policy will be reinstated upon approval
of such application by the insurer or, lacking such approval, upon the 45th day
following the date of such conditional receipt unless the insurer has previously
notified the insured in writing of its disapproval of such application. The
reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from such accidental injury as
may be sustained after the date of reinstatement and loss due to such sickness
as may begin more than ten days after such date. In all other respects the
insured and insurer shall have the same rights thereunder as they had under the
policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to
any provisions endorsed hereon or attached hereto in connection with the
reinstatement. Any premium accepted in connection with a reinstatement shall
be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not
to any period more than sixty days prior to the date of reinstatement.
(The last sentence of the above provision may be omitted from any
policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms
by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50, or (2) in the case
of a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue.)
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 29 of 173
2025
(5) NOTICE OF CLAIM: Written notice of claim must be given to the
insurer within 20 days after the occurrence or commencement of any loss
covered by the policy, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible. Notice
given by or on behalf of the insured or the beneficiary to the insurer at . . . .
(insert the location of such office as the insurer may designate for the purpose),
or to any authorized agent of the insurer, with information sufficient to identify
the insured, shall be deemed notice to the insurer.
(In a policy providing a loss-of-time benefit which may be payable for at
least two years, an insurer may at its option insert the following between the
first and second sentences of the above provision:
Subject to the qualifications set forth below, if the insured suffers loss of
time on account of disability for which indemnity may be payable for at least
two years, he or she shall, at least once in every six months after having given
notice of claim, give to the insurer notice of continuance of said disability,
except in the event of legal incapacity. The period of six months following any
filing of proof by the insured or any payment by the insurer on account of such
claim or any denial of liability in whole or in part by the insurer shall be
excluded in applying this provision. Delay in the giving of such notice shall
not impair the insured’s right to any indemnity which would otherwise have
accrued during the period of six months preceding the date on which such
notice is actually given.)
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 30 of 173
2025
(6) CLAIM FORMS: The insurer, upon receipt of a notice of claim, will
furnish to the claimant such forms as are usually furnished by it for filing
proofs of loss. If such forms are not furnished within 15 days after the giving
of such notice the claimant shall be deemed to have complied with the
requirements of this policy as to proof of loss upon submitting, within the time
fixed in the policy for filing proofs of loss, written proof covering the
occurrence, the character and the extent of the loss for which claim is made.
(7) PROOFS OF LOSS: Written proof of loss must be furnished to the
insurer at its said office in case of claim for loss for which this policy provides
any periodic payment contingent upon continuing loss within 90 days after the
termination of the period for which the insurer is liable and in case of claim for
any other loss within 90 days after the date of such loss. Failure to furnish
such proof within the time required shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if
it was not reasonably possible to give proof within such time, provided such
proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the
absence of legal capacity, later than one year from the time proof is otherwise
required.
(8) TIME OF PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Indemnities payable under this
policy for any loss other than loss for which this policy provides any periodic
payment will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof of such
loss. Subject to due written proof of loss, all accrued indemnities for loss for
which this policy provides periodic payment will be paid . . . . (insert period for
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 31 of 173
2025
payment which must not be less frequently than monthly) and any balance
remaining unpaid upon the termination of liability will be paid immediately
upon receipt of due written proof.
(9) PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Indemnity for loss of life will be payable in
accordance with the beneficiary designation and the provisions respecting such
payment which may be prescribed herein and effective at the time of payment.
If no such designation or provision is then effective, such indemnity shall be
payable to the estate of the insured. Any other accrued indemnities unpaid at
the insured’s death may, at the option of the insurer, be paid either to such
beneficiary or to such estate. All other indemnities will be payable to the
insured.
(The following provisions, or either of them, may be included with the
foregoing provision at the option of the insurer:
If any indemnity of this policy shall be payable to the estate of the insured,
or to an insured or beneficiary who is a minor or otherwise not competent to
give a valid release, the insurer may pay such indemnity, up to an amount not
exceeding $. . . . . . (insert an amount which shall not exceed $1,000.00), to any
relative by blood or connection by civil marriage of the insured or beneficiary
who is deemed by the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto. Any payment
made by the insurer in good faith pursuant to this provision shall fully
discharge the insurer to the extent of such payment.
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 32 of 173
2025
Subject to any written direction of the insured in the application or
otherwise all or a portion of any indemnities provided by this policy on
account of hospital, nursing, medical, or surgical services may, at the insurer’s
option and unless the insured requests otherwise in writing not later than the
time of filing proofs of such loss, be paid directly to the hospital or person
rendering such services; but it is not required that the service be rendered by a
particular hospital or person.)
(10) PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS AND AUTOPSY: The insurer at its
own expense shall have the right and the opportunity to examine the person of
the insured when and as often as it may reasonably require during the
pendency of a claim hereunder and to make an autopsy in case of death where
it is not forbidden by law.
(11) LEGAL ACTIONS: No action at law or in equity shall be brought to
recover on this policy prior to the expiration of 60 days after written proof of
loss has been furnished in accordance with the requirements of this policy. No
such action shall be brought after the expiration of three years after the time
written proof of loss is required to be furnished.
(12) CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY: Unless the insured makes an
irrevocable designation of beneficiary, the right to change of beneficiary is
reserved to the insured and the consent of the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall
not be requisite to surrender or assignment of this policy or to any change of
beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to any other changes in this policy.

(The first clause of this provision, relative to the irrevocable designation
of beneficiary, may be omitted at the insurer’s option.)
§ 4030. OPTIONAL STANDARD POLICY PROVISIONS
Except as provided in section 4031 of this title, no health insurance policy
delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State shall contain
provisions respecting the matters set forth in this section unless the provisions
use the language set forth in this section; provided, however, that a health
insurer may, at its option, substitute different language approved by the
Commissioner for one or more provisions, provided the substituted language is
not less favorable in any respect to the insured or covered individual than the
language used in this section. Any provision set forth in this section that is
contained in the policy shall be preceded individually by the appropriate
caption appearing in this section or, at the option of the health insurer, by such
appropriate captions or subcaptions as the Commissioner may approve:
(1) CHANGE OF OCCUPATION: If the insured be injured or contract
sickness after having changed his or her occupation to one classified by the
insurer as more hazardous than that stated in this policy or while doing for
compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so classified, the insurer
will pay only such portion of the indemnities provided in this policy as the
premium paid would have purchased at the rates and within the limits fixed by
the insurer for such more hazardous occupation. If the insured changes his or
her occupation to one classified by the insurer as less hazardous than that
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 34 of 173
2025
stated in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of such change of
occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly, and will return the
excess pro rata unearned premium from the date of change of occupation or
from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of such proof,
whichever is the more recent. In applying this provision, the classification of
occupational risk and the premium rates shall be such as have been last filed by
the insurer prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable or
prior to date of proof of change in occupation with the state official having
supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided at the time this
policy was issued; but if such filing was not required, then the classification of
occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by
the insurer in such state prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the date
of proof of change in occupation.
(2) MISSTATEMENT OF AGE: If the age of the insured has been
misstated, all amounts payable under this policy shall be such as the premium
paid would have purchased at the correct age.
(3) OTHER INSURANCE IN THIS INSURER: If an accident or
sickness or accident and sickness policy or policies previously issued by the
insurer to the insured be in force concurrently herewith, making the aggregate
indemnity for .... (insert type of coverage or coverages) in excess of $
.................... (insert maximum limit of indemnity or indemnities) the excess
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 35 of 173
2025
insurance shall be void and all premiums paid for such excess shall be returned
to the insured or to his or her estate.
or, in lieu thereof:
Insurance effective at any one time on the insured under a like policy or
policies in this insurer is limited to the one such policy elected by the insured,
his or her beneficiary or his or her estate, as the case may be, and the insurer
will return all premiums paid for all other such policies.
(4) INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS: If there be other valid
coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a
provision of service basis or on an expense incurred basis and of which this
insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or
commencement of loss, the only liability under any expense incurred coverage
of this policy shall be for such proportion of the loss as the amount which
would otherwise have been payable hereunder plus the total of the like
amounts under all such other valid coverages for the same loss of which this
insurer had notice bears to the total like amounts under all valid coverages for
such loss, and for the return of such portion of the premiums paid as shall
exceed the pro rata portion for the amount so determined. For the purpose of
applying this provision when other coverage is on a provision of service basis,
the “like amount” of such other coverage shall be taken as the amount which
the services rendered would have cost in the absence of such coverage.
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 36 of 173
2025
(If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also
contains the next following policy provision there shall be added to the caption
of the foregoing provision the phrase “—EXPENSE INCURRED
BENEFITS.” The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a
definition of “other valid coverage,” approved as to form by the
Commissioner, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage
provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by
insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any
province of Canada, and by hospital or medical service organizations, and to
any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the
Commissioner. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include
group insurance, automobile medical payments insurance, or coverage
provided by hospital or medical service organizations or by union welfare
plans or employer or employee benefit organizations. For the purpose of
applying the foregoing policy provision with respect to any insured, any
amount of benefit provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory
benefit statute (including any workers’ compensation or employer’s liability
statute) whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise shall in all
cases be deemed to be “other valid coverage” of which the insurer has had
notice. In applying the foregoing policy provision no third party liability
coverage shall be included as “other valid coverage.”)
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 37 of 173
2025
(5) INSURANCE WITH OTHER INSURERS: If there be other valid
coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on other
than an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given
written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only
liability for such benefits under this policy shall be for such proportion of the
indemnities otherwise provided hereunder for such loss as the like indemnities
of which the insurer had notice (including the indemnities under this policy)
bear to the total amount of all like indemnities for such loss, and for the return
of such portion of the premium paid as shall exceed the pro rata portion for the
indemnities thus determined.
(If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also
contains the next preceding policy provision there shall be added to the caption
of the foregoing provision the phrase “—OTHER BENEFITS.” The insurer
may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “other valid
coverage,” approved as to form by the Commissioner, which definition shall be
limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to
regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other
state of the United States or any province of Canada, and to any other coverage
the inclusion of which may be approved by the Commissioner. In the absence
of such definition such term shall not include group insurance, or benefits
provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit
organizations. For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy provision with
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 38 of 173
2025
respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such insured
pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers’
compensation or employer’s liability statute) whether provided by a
governmental agency or otherwise shall in all cases be deemed to be “other
valid coverage” of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing
policy provision no third party liability coverage shall be included as “other
valid coverage.”)
(6) RELATION OF EARNINGS TO INSURANCE: If the total monthly
amount of loss of time benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss
of time coverage upon the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly
basis, shall exceed the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability
commenced or his or her average monthly earnings for the period of two years
immediately preceding a disability for which claim is made, whichever is the
greater, the insurer will be liable only for such proportionate amount of such
benefits under this policy as the amount of such monthly earnings or such
average monthly earnings of the insured bears to the total amount of monthly
benefits for the same loss under all such coverage upon the insured at the time
such disability commences and for the return of such part of the premiums paid
during such two years as shall exceed the pro rata amount of the premiums for
the benefits actually paid hereunder; but this shall not operate to reduce the
total monthly amount of benefits payable under all such coverage upon the
insured below the sum of $200.00 or the sum of the monthly benefits specified
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 39 of 173
2025
in such coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to reduce
benefits other than those payable for loss of time.
(The foregoing policy provision may be inserted only in a policy which
the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely
payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50; or (2) in the case of a policy
issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue. The insurer
may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “valid loss of time
coverage,” approved as to form by the Commissioner, which definition shall be
limited in subject matter to coverage provided by governmental agencies or by
organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities
of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, or to
any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the
Commissioner or any combination of such coverages. In the absence of such
definition such term shall not include any coverage provided for such insured
pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workers’
compensation or employer’s liability statute), or benefits provided by union
welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations.)
(7) UNPAID PREMIUM: Upon the payment of a claim under this policy,
any premium then due and unpaid or covered by any note or written order may
be deducted therefrom.
(8) CANCELLATION: The insurer may cancel this policy at any time by
written notice delivered to the insured, or mailed to his or her last address as
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 40 of 173
2025
shown by the records of the insurer, stating when, not less than five days
thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective; and after the policy has been
continued beyond its original term the insured may cancel this policy at any
time by written notice delivered or mailed to the insurer, effective upon receipt
or on such later date as may be specified in such notice. In the event of
cancellation, the insurer will return promptly the unearned portion of any
premium paid. If the insured cancels, the earned premium shall be computed
by the use of the short-rate table last filed with the state official having
supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided when the policy
was issued. If the insurer cancels, the earned premium shall be computed pro
rata. Cancellation shall be without prejudice to any claim originating prior to
the effective date of cancellation.
(9) CONFORMITY WITH STATE STATUTES: Any provision of this
policy which, on its effective date, is in conflict with the statutes of the state in
which the insured resides on such date is hereby amended to conform to the
minimum requirements of such statutes.
(10) ILLEGAL OCCUPATION: The insurer shall not be liable for any
loss to which a contributing cause was the insured’s commission of or attempt
to commit a felony or to which a contributing cause was the insured’s being
engaged in an illegal occupation.

§ 4031. OMISSION OF INAPPLICABLE OR INCONSISTENT
STANDARD PROVISIONS
If any provision of sections 4029 and 4030 of this title is in whole or in part
inapplicable to or inconsistent with the coverage provided by a particular form
of policy, the health insurer, with the approval of the Commissioner, shall omit
from such policy any inapplicable provision or part of a provision, and shall
modify any inconsistent provision or part of the provision in such manner as to
make the provision as contained in the policy consistent with the coverage
provided by the policy.
§ 4032. ORDER OF STANDARD POLICY PROVISIONS
The provisions specified in sections 4029 and 4030 of this title, or any
corresponding provisions used in lieu of those provisions as permitted by those
sections, shall either be printed in the same order as the provisions are set forth
in those sections or, at the option of the health insurer, any such provision may
appear as a unit in any part of the policy, with other provisions to which it may
be logically related, provided the resulting policy shall not be in whole or in
part unintelligible, uncertain, ambiguous, abstruse, or likely to mislead a
person to whom the policy is offered, delivered, or issued.
§ 4033. DISCRETIONARY CLAUSES PROHIBITED
(a) The purpose of this section is to ensure that health insurance benefits,
disability income protection coverage, and life insurance benefits are
contractually guaranteed and to avoid the conflict of interest that may occur

any provision relating to notice of claim, proofs of loss, time of payment of
claims, or time within which legal action must be brought upon the policy that,
in the opinion of the Commissioner, is less favorable to the persons insured
than would be permitted by the provisions set forth in section 4029 of this title.
In addition, each such policy shall contain in substance the following
provisions:
(1) A provision that the policy; the application of the policyholder, if an
application or copy is attached to the policy; and the individual applications, if
any, submitted by the employees or members in connection with the policy
shall constitute the entire contract between the parties, and that all statements,
in the absence of fraud, made by any applicant or applicants shall be deemed
representations and not warranties, and that no such statement shall avoid the
insurance or reduce benefits under the policy unless contained in a written
application, of which a copy is attached to the policy.
(2) A provision that the health insurer will furnish to the policyholder,
for delivery to each employee or member of the insured group, an individual
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 52 of 173

certificate setting forth in summary form a statement of the essential features
of the insurance coverage of the employee or member and to whom benefits
are payable under the policy. If dependents are included in the coverage, only
one certificate need be issued for each family unit.
(3) A provision that to the group originally insured may be added from
time to time eligible new employees or members or dependents, as the case
may be, in accordance with the terms of the policy.
(4) A provision that the health insurer shall not exclude part-time
employees and shall offer the same group health benefits to part-time
employees as it offers to the employee groups of which the part-time
employees would be members if they were full-time employees. The health
insurer shall offer to include the part-time employees as part of the employer’s
employee group, at the full rate to be paid by the employer and the employee,
at a rate prorated between the employer and the employee, or at the employee’s
expense. As used in this subdivision, “part-time employee” means any
employee who works a minimum of at least 17.5 hours per week.

annual limitation on cost sharing for any plan year, the annual limitation on
cost sharing for self-only coverage for that year shall be the dollar limit for
self-only coverage in the preceding calendar year, increased by any percentage
by which the average per capita premium for health insurance coverage in
Vermont for the preceding calendar year exceeds the average per capita
premium for the year before that.

coverage for any year in which the federal government does not establish an
annual limitation on cost sharing shall be twice the dollar limit for self-only
coverage described in subdivision (i) of this subdivision (B).

not establish any annual or lifetime limit on the dollar amount of essential
health benefits, as defined in Section 1302(b) of the Patient Protection and

adults that have in effect a recommendation from the Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with

prior health insurer’s policy or contract was subject to section 4048d of this
title; or
(B) the extension of benefits required for the succeeding health
insurer’s policy or contract, except that any such benefits may be reduced by
benefits actually payable under the prior health insurer’s plan.
(5) The preexisting condition limitation of a succeeding health insurer’s
policy or contract shall provide a level of benefits equal to the lesser of:
(A) the benefits of the succeeding health insurer’s policy or contract
determined without application of the preexisting conditions limitation; or
(B) the benefits of the prior health insurer’s policy or contract.
(6) The succeeding health insurer, in applying a deductible or waiting-
period provision in its policy or contract, shall give credit for the satisfaction of

Subchapter 6. Other Forms of Health Coverage
§ 4051. MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE POLICIES
(a) Community rating.
(1) A health insurer shall use a community rating method acceptable to
the Commissioner for determining premiums for Medicare supplement
insurance policies.
(2) The Commissioner shall adopt rules for standards and procedure for
permitting health insurers that issue Medicare supplement insurance policies to
use one or more risk classifications in their community rating method. The
premium charged shall not deviate from the community rate and the rules shall
not permit medical underwriting and screening, except that a health insurer
may set different community rates for persons eligible for Medicare by reason
of age and persons eligible for Medicare by reason of disability.
(b) Premium increases.
(1) Within five days after receiving a request for approval of any
composite average rate increase in excess of three percent, or any other
coverage changes that the Commissioner determines will have a comparable
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 66 of 173
2025
impact on cost or availability of coverage for a Medicare supplement insurance
policy issued by any health insurer with 5,000 or more total lives in the
Vermont Medicare supplement insurance market, the Commissioner shall
notify the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent Living of the
proposed premium increase. A composite average rate is the enrollment-
weighted average rate increase of all plans offered by a health insurer.
(2) Within five days after receiving notification pursuant to subdivision
(1) of this subsection, the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent
Living shall inform the members of the Advisory Board established pursuant to
33 V.S.A. § 505 of the proposed premium increase.
(3)(A) The Commissioner shall not approve any request to increase
Medicare supplement insurance premium rates unless the amount of the rate
increase complies with the statutory standards for approval under sections
4026, 4513, 4584, and 5104 of this title. Any approved rate increase shall not
be based on an unreasonable change in loss ratio from the previous year, unless
the Commissioner makes written findings that such change is necessary to
prevent a substantial adverse impact on the financial condition of the health
insurer. In acting on such rate increase requests, the Commissioner may deny
the request, approve the rate increase as requested, or approve a rate increase in
an amount different from the increase requested. A decision by the
Commissioner other than an approval of the rate requested may be appealed by
the health insurer, provided that the burden of proof shall be on the health
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 67 of 173
2025
insurer to show that the approved rate does not meet the statutory standards
established under this subsection.
(B) Before acting on the rate increase requested, the Commissioner
may make such examination or investigation as the Commissioner deems
necessary, including where applicable the review process set forth in
subdivision (C) of this subdivision (3).
(C)(i) In reviewing any Medicare supplement insurance rate increase
for which an independent analysis has been performed pursuant to 33 V.S.A.
§ 6706 and in which the health insurer’s requested composite average increase,
the independent expert’s recommended composite average rate increase, or the
Department actuary’s recommended composite average rate increase differ by
two percentage points or more, the Commissioner shall hold a public hearing at
which the health insurer, the Department’s actuary, the independent expert, any
intervenor, and the public will have the opportunity to present written and oral
testimony and will be available to answer questions of the Commissioner and
those present.
(ii) The hearing shall be noticed and held at a time and place so as
to facilitate public participation, and shall be recorded and become part of the
record before the Commissioner. At the Commissioner’s discretion, the
hearing may be conducted remotely.
(iii) If the carrier’s requested composite average increase, the
independent expert’s recommended composite average increase, or the
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 68 of 173
2025
Department actuary’s recommended composite average increase differs by less
than two percentage points, the Department and the parties shall confer by
conference call, or by any other available media, to review the rate requests
and recommendations. However, a public hearing may be held at the
Commissioner’s discretion for good cause shown.
(D)(i) In any review held in accordance with this subdivision (3), the
Commissioner shall permit intervention by any person whom the
Commissioner determines will materially advance the interests of the covered
individuals. The intervenor shall have access to and may use the information
of the independent expert appointed under 33 V.S.A. § 6706.
(ii) The reasonable and necessary cost of intervention as
determined by the Commissioner shall be paid by the affected policyholders or
certificate holders. The maximum payment shall be $2,500.00 except when
waived by the Commissioner for good cause shown. The $2,500.00 maximum
amount may be adjusted to reflect, at the Commissioner’s discretion,
appropriate inflation factors.
(E) Nonproprietary, relevant information in any Medicare
supplement insurance rate filing, including any analysis by the Department’s
actuary and the independent expert, shall be made available to the public upon
request.
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 69 of 173
2025
(c) Disability.
(1) A health insurer that issues Medicare supplement insurance policies
or certificates to a person eligible for Medicare by reason of age shall make
available, to persons eligible for Medicare by reason of disability, the same
policies or certificates that are offered and sold to persons eligible for
Medicare by reason of age. The initial enrollment period for any such policies
or certificates shall be at least six months following the date the individual
becomes eligible for Medicare by reason of disability. Any additional
enrollment periods as required by law and offered to individuals eligible by
reason of age shall be offered to individuals eligible by reason of disability.
(2) This subsection does not apply to persons eligible for Medicare by
reason of end stage renal disease.
(d) Outreach and education. The Department of Financial Regulation shall
collaborate with health insurers, advocates for older Vermonters and for other
Medicare-eligible adults, and the Office of the Health Care Advocate to
educate the public about the benefits and limitations of Medicare supplement
insurance policies and Medicare Advantage plans, including information to
help the public understand issues relating to coverage, costs, and provider
networks.
§ 4052. BLANKET HEALTH INSURANCE
(a) Blanket health insurance is a form of health insurance that, to the extent
permitted under federal law, is supplemental to major medical health insurance
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 70 of 173
2025
or provides coverage other than the payment of all or a portion of the cost of
health care services or products, and that covers special groups of persons as
follows:
(1) under a policy or contract issued to any common carrier, which shall
be deemed the policyholder, covering a group defined as all persons who may
become passengers on such common carrier;
(2) under a policy or contract issued to an employer, who shall be
deemed the policyholder, covering any group of employees defined by
reference to exceptional hazards incident to such employment;

school, or approved education program, as those terms are defined in
16 V.S.A. § 11; to a postsecondary school, as defined in 16 V.S.A.
§ 176(b)(1); or to a prequalified private prekindergarten provider, as defined in
16 V.S.A. § 829(a)(3), or to the head or principal of the school, program, or
provider, who or which shall be deemed the policyholder, covering students or
teachers, or both;
(4) under a policy or contract issued in the name of any volunteer fire
department, emergency medical services provider, or other such volunteer
group, which shall be deemed the policyholder, covering all of the members of
the department or group in connection with their department or group
activities; or
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 71 of 173
2025
(5) under a policy or contract issued to any other substantially similar
group that, in the discretion of the Commissioner and after the prior approval
by the Commissioner of the group, may be subject to the issuance of a blanket
health policy or contract.
(b)(1) No blanket health insurance policy shall contain any provision
relating to notice of claim, proofs of loss, time of payment of claims, or time
within which legal action must be brought upon the policy that, in the opinion
of the Commissioner, is less favorable to the persons insured than would be
permitted by the provisions set forth in section 4029 of this title.
(2) An individual application shall not be required from a person
covered under a blanket health policy or contract, nor shall it be necessary for
the insurer to furnish each person a certificate.
(3) All benefits under any blanket health policy shall, unless for hospital
and physician service or surgical benefits, be payable to the person insured, or
to the person’s designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to the person’s
estate, except that if the person insured is a minor, the benefits may be made
payable to the minor’s parent, guardian, or other person actually supporting the
minor.
(4) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the legal liability of
policyholders for the death of, or injury to, any members of the group.
(c) No blanket health insurance policy that provides coverage for the
payment of all or a portion of the cost of health care services or products shall
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 72 of 173
2025
contain any provision that does not comply with a requirement of this title, or a
rule adopted pursuant to this title applicable to health insurance, other than
those requirements applicable to nongroup health insurance or small group
health insurance. The Commissioner may waive the application to a blanket
insurance policy of one or more of the health insurance requirements of this
title, or a rule adopted pursuant to this title, if the requirement is not relevant to
the types of risks and duration of risks insured against in the blanket insurance
policy.
§ 4053. SHORT-TERM, LIMITED-DURATION HEALTH INSURANCE
(a) As used in this section, “short-term, limited-duration health insurance”
means health insurance that provides medical, hospital, or major medical
expense benefits coverage pursuant to a policy or contract with a health insurer
and that has an expiration date specified in the policy or contract that is three
months or less after the original effective date of the policy or contract.
(b) No person shall provide short-term, limited-duration health insurance
coverage without a certificate of authority from the Commissioner to offer
health insurance in this State unless the person is exempted by subdivision

(c) A short-term, limited-duration health insurance policy or contract shall
be nonrenewable, and a health insurer shall not issue a short-term, limited-
duration health insurance policy or contract to any person if the issuance would

insurance coverage for more than three months in any 12-month period.
(d) A policy or contract for short-term, limited-duration health insurance
coverage shall display prominently in the policy or contract and in any
application materials provided in connection with enrollment in that coverage,
in at least 14-point type, certain disclosures regarding the scope of short-term,
limited-duration health insurance coverage, including the types of benefits and
consumer protections that are and are not included. The Commissioner shall
determine the specific disclosure language that shall be used in all short-term,
limited-duration health insurance policies, contracts, and application materials
and shall provide the language to the health insurers offering that coverage.
(e) The Commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to 3 V.S.A. chapter 25:
(1) establishing the minimum financial, marketing, service, and other
requirements for registration of a health insurer to provide short-term, limited-
duration health insurance coverage to individuals in this State;
(2) requiring a health insurer seeking to provide short-term, limited-

diagnosed congenital defect or birth abnormality.
(2) Coverage for a newly born child shall be provided without notice or
additional premium for not less than 60 days after the date of birth. If payment
of a specific premium or subscription fee is required in order to have the
coverage continue beyond such 60-day period, the policy may require that
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 75 of 173
2025
notification of the birth of the newly born child and payment of the required
premium or fees be furnished to the health insurer within a period of not less
than 60 days after the date of birth.
(c) Adopted child coverage.
(1) As used in this section:
(A) “Child” means, in connection with any adoption or placement for
adoption of the child, an individual who has not attained 18 years of age as of
the date of the adoption or placement for adoption.
(B) “Placement for adoption” means the assumption and retention by
a person of a legal obligation for total or partial support of a child in
anticipation of the adoption of the child. The child’s placement with a person
terminates upon the termination of such legal obligations.
(2) In any case in which a health insurance plan provides coverage for
dependent children of covered individuals, the plan shall provide benefits to
dependent children placed with covered individuals for adoption under the
same terms and conditions as apply to the natural, dependent children of the
covered individuals, irrespective of whether the adoption has become final.
(3) A health insurance plan shall not restrict coverage under the plan of
any dependent child adopted by a covered individual, or placed with a covered
individual for adoption, solely on the basis of a preexisting condition of the
child at the time that the child would otherwise become eligible for coverage
VT LEG #383327 v.1

disease or other limited benefit coverage, and further provided that nothing in
this subsection shall require a plan to make coverage available for the child of
a child receiving dependent coverage.
(e) Coverage of adult child with a disability.
(1) A health insurance plan that provides for terminating the coverage of
a dependent child upon attainment of the limiting age for dependent children
specified in the policy shall not limit or restrict coverage with respect to an
unmarried child who meets all of the following criteria:
(A) is incapable of self-sustaining employment by reason of a mental
or physical disability that has been found to be a disability that qualifies or

methodology in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P;
(B) became so incapable prior to attainment of the limiting age; and
(C) is chiefly dependent upon the employee, member, subscriber, or

any person based upon the existence of such a condition; provided, however,
that a health insurance plan may require reasonable periodic proof of a
continuing condition not more frequently than once every year.

covers dependent children who are full-time college students beyond 18 years
of age shall include coverage for a dependent’s medically necessary leave of
absence from school for a period not to exceed 24 months or the date on which
coverage would otherwise end pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
policy or coverage, whichever comes first, except that coverage may continue
under subsection (b) of this section as appropriate. To establish entitlement to
coverage under this subsection, documentation and certification by the
student’s treating health care professional of the medical necessity of a leave of
absence shall be submitted to the health insurer or, for self-insured plans, the
health plan administrator. The health insurance plan may require reasonable
periodic proof from the student’s treating health care professional that the
leave of absence continues to be medically necessary.

claims for covered services, and to appeal the denial of any benefit, without the
approval of the other parent; and
(3) make payments on claims submitted in accordance with subdivision
(2) of this subsection directly to the parent who paid the provider, the provider
as assignee, the State Medicaid agency, or any State agency administering
health benefits or a health benefit plan for which Medicaid is a source of
funding.

No. 11 Page 79 of 173

return; or
(3) the child does not reside with the parent or in the health insurer’s
service area.

health coverage for a child, and the parent is eligible for dependent health
coverage, the health insurer shall be required:
(1) To enroll, under the dependent coverage, a child who is otherwise
eligible for the coverage without regard to any enrollment season restrictions
or any seasonal restrictions on switching from one plan to another, upon
application of either parent, the employer, the State agency administering the
Medicaid program, any State agency administering health benefits or a health
insurance plan for which Medicaid is a source of funding, or the child support
enforcement program.
(2) Not to disenroll or eliminate coverage of the child unless the health
insurer is provided satisfactory written evidence that:
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 80 of 173
2025

(B) the child is or will be enrolled in comparable health coverage
through another health insurer that will take effect not later than the effective
date of disenrollment; or

health insurer, whichever is sooner. The health insurer shall have 10 days from
notice to process the enrollment and shall be entitled to premiums from the
effective date of enrollment.
(d) A health insurer shall not impose requirements on a State agency that
has been assigned the rights of an individual eligible for medical assistance
under Medicaid and covered for health benefits from the health insurer that are
different from requirements applicable to an agent or assignee of any other
individual so covered.

insurance plan had the health insurer enrolled the child upon receiving notice.
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 81 of 173
2025
(f) Notice by first class mail, postage prepaid, or by any other method
showing actual receipt, shall be presumptive evidence of its receipt by the
health insurer to whom it is addressed. Any period of time that is determined
under this section by the giving of notice shall commence to run from the date
of mailing, if the notice is mailed, or the date of actual receipt if another
method of transmitting the notice is used.
(g) A health insurer may cancel any health insurance plan that is the subject
of a medical support order for nonpayment of premium only if the health
insurer mails or delivers notice of cancellation to both parents and all other

procedures provided by the health insurance plan shall have the right to an
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 83 of 173
2025
independent external review of a decision under a health insurance plan to
deny, reduce, or terminate health care coverage or to deny payment for a health
care service. The independent review shall be available when requested in
writing by the affected covered individual, provided the decision to be
reviewed requires the plan to expend at least $100.00 for the service and the
decision by the plan is based on one of the following reasons:
(1) The health care service is a covered benefit that the health insurer
has determined to be not medically necessary.
(2) A limitation is placed on the selection of a health care provider that
is claimed by the covered individual to be inconsistent with limits imposed by
the health insurance plan and any applicable laws and rules.
(3) The health care treatment has been determined to be experimental or
investigational or is an off-label drug. A health insurance plan that denies use
of a prescription drug for the treatment of cancer as not medically necessary or
as an experimental or investigational use shall treat any internal appeal of such
denial as an emergency or urgent appeal and shall decide the appeal within the
time frames applicable to emergency and urgent internal appeals under rules
adopted by the Commissioner.
(4) The health care service involves a medically based decision that a
condition is preexisting.
(5) The decision involves an adverse determination related to surprise
medical billing, as established under Section 2799A-1 or 2799A-2 of the
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 84 of 173
2025
Public Health Service Act, including with respect to whether an item or service
that is the subject of the adverse determination is an item or service to which
Section 2799A-1 or 2799A-2 of the Public Health Service Act, or both,
applies.
(c) The right to review under this section shall not be construed to change
the terms of coverage under a health insurance plan.
(d) The Department shall adopt rules necessary to carry out the purposes of
this section. The rules shall ensure that the independent external reviews have
the following characteristics:
(1) The independent external reviews shall be conducted:
(A) by independent review organizations pursuant to a contract with
the Department, and the reviewers shall include health care providers
credentialed with respect to the health care service under review and shall have
no conflict of interest relating to the performance of their duties under this
section; and
(B) in accordance with standards of decision making based on
objective clinical evidence, shall resolve all issues in a timely manner, and
shall provide expedited resolution when the decision relates to emergency or
urgent health care services.
(2) A covered individual shall:
(A) Be provided with adequate notice of the covered individual’s
review rights under this section.
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 85 of 173
2025
(B) Have the right to use outside assistance during the review process
and to submit evidence relating to the health care service.
(C) Pay an application fee of $25.00 for each request for an
independent external review of an appealable decision not to exceed a total of
$75.00 annually. The application fee may be waived or reduced based on a
determination by the Commissioner that the financial circumstances of the
covered individual warrant a waiver or reduction. The application fee shall be
paid by the health insurer, not the covered individual, if the independent
review organization reverses the health insurer’s decision to deny payment for
a health care service.
(D) Be protected from retaliation for exercising the covered
individual’s right to an independent external review under this section.
(3) Other costs of the independent review shall be paid by the health
insurance plan.
(4) The independent review organization shall issue to both parties a
written review decision that is evidence-based. The decision shall be binding
on the health insurance plan.
(5) The confidentiality of any health care information acquired or
provided to the independent review organization shall be maintained in
compliance with any applicable State or federal laws.
VT LEG #383327 v.1

No. 11 Page 86 of 173

(6) The records of, and internal materials prepared for, specific reviews
by any independent review organization under this section shall be exempt
from public inspection and copying under the Public Records Act.
(e) Decisions relating to the following health care services shall not be
reviewed under this section but shall be reviewed by the review process
provided by law:
(1) health care services provided by the Vermont Medicaid program or
Medicaid benefits provided through a contracted health plan; and
(2) health care services provided to incarcerated individuals by the
Department of Corrections.
§ 4064. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES REVIEW
(a) The purposes of this section are to:

collaborative process, the primary objective of which is to enhance the
effectiveness of clinical treatment;

limiting in any way the covered individual’s ability to receive additional
covered in-person services from the same or a different health care provider for
diagnosis or treatment of the same condition.
(h) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a health insurance
plan to reimburse the distant site health care provider if the distant site health
care provider has insufficient information to render an opinion.

services be provided by a licensed naturopathic physician under contract with
the insurer or shall be covered in a manner consistent with out-of-network

amounts, limits, and review shall not function to direct treatment in a manner
unfairly discriminative against athletic trainer care, and collectively shall be

treatment modalities among different types of health care professionals.
