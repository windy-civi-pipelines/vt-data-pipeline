No. R-29. House concurrent resolution designating February 12, 2025, as Vermont
Outdoor Recreation Day at the State House.
(H.C.R.24)
Offered by: Representative White of Waitsfield
Whereas, Vermont is proud of its unparalleled and diverse natural landscape, and it is
a global destination for many types of world-class outdoor recreation, and
Whereas, our State’s outdoor recreational assets consist of over 8,000 miles of public
access trails, including 150 miles of recreational rail trails; 360,000 acres of wildlife
management areas, State forests, and State parks; more than six million acres of hunting-
accessible land; and over 40 alpine and cross-country ski areas, and
Whereas, in 2012 Acts and Resolves No. 77, the General Assembly designated skiing
and snowboarding as the State’s official winter sports, and
Whereas, the importance of welcoming everyone, regardless of ethnicity or
background, to enjoy outdoor recreational pursuits is recognized, and outdoor
recreational venues embrace the intrinsic community values of inclusion and
representation, and
Whereas, outdoor recreation creates business opportunities, attracts new residents, and
offers workforce pathways that incentivize young Vermonters to remain in the State, and
Whereas, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, in fiscal year 2023, in
businesses located in all 14 Vermont counties, outdoor recreation generates $2.1 billion
in economic import, and the industry employed over 16,000 persons, comprising just
over five percent of the Vermont workforce, and
Whereas, Vermont Outdoor Recreation Day is an occasion to celebrate the importance
of outdoor recreation to the economy, the quality of life, and the mental and physical
well-being of Vermonters and visitors, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly designates February 12, 2025, as Vermont Outdoor
Recreation Day at the State House, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the Secretary of Commerce and Community Development; the Secretary of Natural
Resources; the Commissioner of Forests, Parks and Recreation; the Commissioner of
Tourism and Marketing; the Executive Director of the Vermont Outdoor Business
Alliance; the Executive Director of the Vermont Mountain Bike Association; and the
President of the Vermont Ski Areas Association.
