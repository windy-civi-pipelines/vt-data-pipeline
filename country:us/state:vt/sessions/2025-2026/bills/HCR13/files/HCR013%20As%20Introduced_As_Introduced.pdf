Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 13
Offered by All Members of the House
House concurrent resolution in memory of the former esteemed Clerk of the Vermont House of
Representatives Robert Louis Picher of Winooski
Whereas, dispassionate, informed, and nonpartisan are all essential attributes for the Clerk of the
House of Representatives, and for three decades in this role (1963–1993), and again in 2002 on an
acting basis, House Clerk Bob Picher always adhered to these core principles, as was reflected in his
election, during the 1980s, as President of the American Society of Legislative Clerks and
Secretaries, and
Whereas, Bob Picher, a lifelong resident of Winooski, was born on July 30, 1924, and graduated
from the former Cathedral High School in Burlington; Assumption College (University) in Worcester,
Massachusetts; and Georgetown University Law School in Washington, DC, and
Whereas, he served in Europe as a World War II U.S. Army combat platoon leader, returned to active
duty during the Korean Conflict, achieved the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Vermont National
Guard, and was the Commander of and a Major General in the Vermont State Guard, and
Whereas, a respected lawyer, Bob Picher was an extraordinary public servant, who, prior to his
election as Clerk of the House, served as Executive Clerk to Governor Joseph B. Johnson and as
Secretary of Civil and Military Affairs under Governor Robert T. Stafford, and
Whereas, locally, he was elected as a zoning board member, justice of the peace, and grand juror, and
Whereas, Bob Picher’s religious and musical passions found commonality as a parishioner, chorister,
and choral director at St. Francis Xavier Church; he also sang in the South Burlington Community
Chorus; and he enjoyed other voluntary roles related to his French-Canadian heritage, veterans’ affairs,
and the Winooski community’s history, and
Whereas, Bob Picher died on May 10, 2024, at 99 years of age, and his survivors include his
children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly extends its sincere condolences to the family of the former esteemed
Clerk of the Vermont House of Representatives Robert Louis Picher, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the family of
Bob Picher.
