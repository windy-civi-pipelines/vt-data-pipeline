Whereas, the origin of Robin’s Nest Children’s Center (Robin’s Nest), a special place for the youngest
children to learn and play in a welcoming and supportive environment, dates from the spring of 1985 when a
Burlington early childhood program announced its closure, and

availability of a trusted child care facility, and the staff who would lose their jobs, and

Whereas, their goal was to establish “a program where children received quality early education, families
could find support through a diverse community with others who looked like their own, and a place where early
educators would be respectfully compensated,” and
Whereas, this collaborative planning process proved productive, and later in 1985, Robin’s Nest opened its
doors to “provide quality care and education in multi-age groups with high ratios of adults to
children…[enabling] children to travel through developmental stages at their own rate and to learn from one
another,” and
Whereas, this core objective is reflected in Robin’s Nest’s mission to “provide a play-based environment for
infants, toddlers, and preschoolers; nurturing minds, friendships, and families,” and
Whereas, in 2025, Robin’s Nest marks 40 years of early childhood care and educational excellence and now
serves 31 infants, toddlers, and preschoolers, representing 23 families, with the caring support of nine dedicated
teachers, and
