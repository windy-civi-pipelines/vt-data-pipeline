Burlington, Headrick of Burlington, Hooper of Burlington, Kleppner of Burlington,

Whereas, the origin of Robin’s Nest Children’s Center (Robin’s Nest), a special place
for the youngest children to learn and play in a welcoming and supportive environment,
dates from the spring of 1985 when a Burlington early childhood program announced its
closure, and
Whereas, this decision impacted the parents of the enrolled youngsters, whose daily
lives depended on the availability of a trusted child care facility, and the staff who would
lose their jobs, and
Whereas, in response to this pending familial and employment dilemma, a group of
parents coalesced to develop a replacement option, resulting in the creation of Robin’s
Nest, and
Whereas, their goal was to establish “a program where children received quality early
education, families could find support through a diverse community with others who
looked like their own, and a place where early educators would be respectfully
compensated,” and
Whereas, this collaborative planning process proved productive, and later in 1985,
Robin’s Nest opened its doors to “provide quality care and education in multi-age groups
with high ratios of adults to children…[enabling] children to travel through
developmental stages at their own rate and to learn from one another,” and
Whereas, this core objective is reflected in Robin’s Nest’s mission to “provide a play-
based environment for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers; nurturing minds, friendships,
and families,” and
Whereas, in 2025, Robin’s Nest marks 40 years of early childhood care and
educational excellence and now serves 31 infants, toddlers, and preschoolers,
representing 23 families, with the caring support of nine dedicated teachers, and
Whereas, the diverse enrolled population includes 35 percent who are BIPOC (Black,
Indigenous, or Persons of Color) and 65 percent receive monetary support from the
State’s Child Care Financial Assistance Program, and
