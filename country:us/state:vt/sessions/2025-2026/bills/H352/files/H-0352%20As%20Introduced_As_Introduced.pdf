12 (2) supporting community participation in the development and
13 governance of distributed renewable generation;
14 (3) supporting the delivery of benefits to tenants of buildings that are
15 designated as affordable housing;
16 (4) supporting the delivery of benefits to school and municipally owned
17 buildings; and

1 their requirement under subdivision 8005(a)(2) of this title, as determined by

3 (e) Solicitation requirement.
4 (1) On a schedule to be developed by the Commission, each retail
5 electricity provider with an obligation under subdivision 8005(a)(2) of this title
6 shall issue solicitations for eligible distributed generation until it has met its
7 capacity requirement. Coordinated solicitations shall be encouraged. Each
8 retail electric provider shall review proposed projects in its service territory
9 according to a set of consistent core criteria as approved by the Commission
10 and consistent with the objectives set forth in this section.
11 (2) Requirements for retail electricity providers that are 100 percent
12 renewable pursuant to subdivision 8005(b)(1) of this title may be limited by
13 the Commission to an amount equal to the provider’s requirement to meet
14 distributed generation with load growth above the baseline year of 2024 and
15 allowed on a less frequent solicitation schedule.
16 (f) Program development. On or before January 1, 2027, the Commission
17 shall implement the Renewable Energy for Communities Program. In

1 (2) determine whether a percentage of each retail electricity provider’s
2 capacity requirement should be reserved to serve specific customers who have
3 previously experienced inequitable access to the benefits of renewable energy
4 and determine any minimum requirement for those projects procured under
5 this program for serving those specific customers;
6 (3) establish a set of consistent review criteria to be used by all retail
7 electricity providers in solicitations for eligible distributed generation,
8 considering issues in addition to cost, including community support or
9 engagement while developing the proposal; potential for local workforce
10 development and other community benefits to be delivered to the host
11 community; location of the project, including whether it is in a constrained
12 area of the distribution or transmission system or in an area identified as a
13 preferred location in a regional or municipal enhanced energy plan pursuant to
14 24 V.S.A. § 4352; and anticipated generation profile;
15 (4) identify reporting requirements and necessary metrics to monitor
16 how benefits and burdens from the program are distributed across ratepayers;
