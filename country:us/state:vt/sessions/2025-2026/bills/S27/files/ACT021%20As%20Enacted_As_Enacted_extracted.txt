providers at fair market value;
(2) abolish the debt with no cost or tax consequences for the debtor;

Sec. 3. 1 V.S.A. § 151 is added to read:

Section 2:
§ 151. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH
“Behavioral health” means any behavioral condition bearing on health,
including stress-linked physical symptoms, patient activation, and health
behaviors that can be addressed through support, counseling, change
techniques, coaching, and other interventions. As used in the Vermont Statutes
Annotated, the term does not include mental health conditions or substance use
disorders. The General Assembly recognizes that using the term “behavioral
health” to describe mental health conditions or substance use disorders has a
stigmatizing impact, which may deter individuals from seeking health care for
those conditions, but also recognizes that some jurisdictions interpret the term
to incorporate those conditions and that therefore it may be necessary under
limited circumstances to include the term in the definition of health care
services for the sole reason of avoiding any question about the intended scope
of a specific statute.
Sec. 4. 9 V.S.A. § 2466d is added to read:

Section 3:
§ 2466d. REPORTING OF MEDICAL DEBT INFORMATION
PROHIBITED
(a) A credit reporting agency shall not report or maintain in the file on a
consumer information relating to a medical debt.
(b) As used in this section:
VT LEG #383896 v.1
No. 21 Page 4 of 6
2025
(1) “Health care services” means all supplies, care, and services of a
medical, dental, behavioral health, mental health, substance use disorder
treatment, surgical, psychiatric, therapeutic, diagnostic, preventative,
rehabilitative, or supportive nature, including medication.
(2) “Medical debt” means debt arising from health care services,
including dental services, or from health care goods, including products,
devices, durable medical equipment, and prescription drugs. “Medical debt”
does not include debt arising from services provided by a veterinarian; debt
charged to a credit card unless the credit card is issued under an open-end or
closed-end credit plan offered solely for the payment of health care services;
debt charged to a home equity or general-purpose line of credit; or secured
debt.
Sec. 5. 9 V.S.A. § 2480b is amended to read:

Section 4:
§ 2480b. DISCLOSURES TO CONSUMERS
