1 (A) the amount of the individual’s medical debt that was abolished
2 and the name of the health care provider or providers from whom the entity
3 purchased the individual’s debt;
4 (B) the estimated percentage of the federal poverty level that
5 corresponds to the individual’s household income; and
6 (C) that financial assistance policies are available at all Vermont
7 hospitals in accordance with 18 V.S.A. § 9482, including the following
8 minimum discounts:
9 (i) a 100 percent discount for individuals with household income
10 at or below 250 percent of the federal poverty level; and

2 Sec. 3. 1 V.S.A. § 151 is added to read:
3 § 151. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH
4 “Behavioral health” means any behavioral condition bearing on health,
5 including stress-linked physical symptoms, patient activation, and health
6 behaviors that can be addressed through support, counseling, change
7 techniques, coaching, and other interventions. As used in the Vermont Statutes
8 Annotated, the term does not include mental health conditions or substance use
9 disorders. The General Assembly recognizes that using the term “behavioral
10 health” to describe mental health conditions or substance use disorders has a
11 stigmatizing impact, which may deter individuals from seeking health care for
12 those conditions, but also recognizes that some jurisdictions interpret the term
13 to incorporate those conditions and that therefore it may be necessary under
14 limited circumstances to include the term in the definition of health care
15 services for the sole reason of avoiding any question about the intended scope
16 of a specific statute.
17 Sec. 4. 9 V.S.A. § 2466d is added to read:
18 § 2466d. REPORTING OF MEDICAL DEBT INFORMATION
19 PROHIBITED
20 (a) A credit reporting agency shall not report or maintain in the file on a
21 consumer information relating to a medical debt.
VT LEG #383408 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.27

1 (b) As used in this section:
2 (1) “Health care services” means all supplies, care, and services of a
3 medical, dental, behavioral health, mental health, substance use disorder
4 treatment, surgical, psychiatric, therapeutic, diagnostic, preventative,
5 rehabilitative, or supportive nature, including medication.
6 (2) “Medical debt” means debt arising from health care services,
7 including dental services, or from health care goods, including products,
8 devices, durable medical equipment, and prescription drugs. “Medical debt”
9 does not include debt arising from services provided by a veterinarian; debt
10 charged to a credit card unless the credit card is issued under an open-end or
11 closed-end credit plan offered solely for the payment of health care services;
12 debt charged to a home equity or general-purpose line of credit; or secured
13 debt.
14 Sec. 5. 9 V.S.A. § 2480b is amended to read:
15 § 2480b. DISCLOSURES TO CONSUMERS
16 * * *
17 (c) Any time a credit reporting agency is required to make a written
18 disclosure to consumers pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1681g, it shall disclose, in at
19 least 12-point type, and in bold type as indicated, the following notice:
