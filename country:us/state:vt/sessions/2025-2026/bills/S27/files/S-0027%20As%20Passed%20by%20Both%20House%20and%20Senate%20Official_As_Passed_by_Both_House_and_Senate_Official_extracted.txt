Sec. 2. [Deleted.]
Sec. 3. 1 V.S.A. § 151 is added to read:

Section 3:
§ 151. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH
“Behavioral health” means any behavioral condition bearing on health,
including stress-linked physical symptoms, patient activation, and health
behaviors that can be addressed through support, counseling, change
techniques, coaching, and other interventions. As used in the Vermont Statutes
Annotated, the term does not include mental health conditions or substance
use disorders. The General Assembly recognizes that using the term
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.27
2025 Page 8 of 10
“behavioral health” to describe mental health conditions or substance use
disorders has a stigmatizing impact, which may deter individuals from seeking
health care for those conditions, but also recognizes that some jurisdictions
interpret the term to incorporate those conditions and that therefore it may be
necessary under limited circumstances to include the term in the definition of
health care services for the sole reason of avoiding any question about the
intended scope of a specific statute.
Sec. 4. 9 V.S.A. § 2466d is added to read:

Section 4:
§ 2466d. REPORTING OF MEDICAL DEBT INFORMATION

(1) “Health care services” means all supplies, care, and services of a
medical, dental, behavioral health, mental health, substance use disorder
treatment, surgical, psychiatric, therapeutic, diagnostic, preventative,
rehabilitative, or supportive nature, including medication.
(2) “Medical debt” means debt arising from health care services,
including dental services, or from health care goods, including products,
devices, durable medical equipment, and prescription drugs. “Medical debt”
does not include debt arising from services provided by a veterinarian; debt
charged to a credit card unless the credit card is issued under an open-end or
closed-end credit plan offered solely for the payment of health care services;
debt charged to a home equity or general-purpose line of credit; or secured
debt.

2025 Page 7 of 10
(A) the amount of the individual’s medical debt that was abolished
and the name of the health care provider or providers from whom the entity

(B) the estimated percentage of the federal poverty level that
corresponds to the individual’s household income; and
(C) that financial assistance policies are available at all Vermont
hospitals in accordance with 18 V.S.A. § 9482, including the following

(i) a 100 percent discount for individuals with household income
at or below 250 percent of the federal poverty level; and
(ii) at least a 40 percent discount for individuals with household
income between 250 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level.
(c) In order to be eligible for repayment of medical debt under this section,
the following conditions must be met:

Sec. 2. 2022 Acts and Resolves No. 83, Sec. 53(b)(5)(B), as amended by 2022
Acts and Resolves No. 185, Sec. C.102 and 2023 Acts and Resolves No. 78,

Sec. 2. [Deleted.]
Sec. 3. 1 V.S.A. § 151 is added to read:
§ 151. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH
“Behavioral health” means any behavioral condition bearing on health,
including stress-linked physical symptoms, patient activation, and health
behaviors that can be addressed through support, counseling, change
techniques, coaching, and other interventions. As used in the Vermont Statutes
Annotated, the term does not include mental health conditions or substance
use disorders. The General Assembly recognizes that using the term

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE AND HOUSE S.27
2025 Page 8 of 10
“behavioral health” to describe mental health conditions or substance use
disorders has a stigmatizing impact, which may deter individuals from seeking
health care for those conditions, but also recognizes that some jurisdictions
interpret the term to incorporate those conditions and that therefore it may be
necessary under limited circumstances to include the term in the definition of
health care services for the sole reason of avoiding any question about the
intended scope of a specific statute.
Sec. 4. 9 V.S.A. § 2466d is added to read:
§ 2466d. REPORTING OF MEDICAL DEBT INFORMATION
PROHIBITED
(a) A credit reporting agency shall not report or maintain in the file on a
consumer information relating to a medical debt.
(b) As used in this section:
(1) “Health care services” means all supplies, care, and services of a
medical, dental, behavioral health, mental health, substance use disorder
treatment, surgical, psychiatric, therapeutic, diagnostic, preventative,
rehabilitative, or supportive nature, including medication.
(2) “Medical debt” means debt arising from health care services,
including dental services, or from health care goods, including products,
devices, durable medical equipment, and prescription drugs. “Medical debt”
does not include debt arising from services provided by a veterinarian; debt
charged to a credit card unless the credit card is issued under an open-end or
closed-end credit plan offered solely for the payment of health care services;
debt charged to a home equity or general-purpose line of credit; or secured
debt.
Sec. 5. 9 V.S.A. § 2480b is amended to read:
§ 2480b. DISCLOSURES TO CONSUMERS
* * *
(c) Any time a credit reporting agency is required to make a written
disclosure to consumers pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1681g, it shall disclose, in at
least 12-point type, and in bold type as indicated, the following notice:
“NOTICE TO VERMONT CONSUMERS
* * *
(2) Under Vermont law, no one may access your credit report without
your permission except under the following limited circumstances:

delinquent taxes; or
(H) where the request for a credit report is by an organization that is
exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code for
the purpose of determining eligibility for the abolition of medical debt.
* * *
Sec. 6. 9 V.S.A. § 2480g is amended to read:
§ 2480g. EXEMPTIONS
* * *

section 2480e of this title shall not apply to a tax-exempt organization that is a
large health care facility, as defined in 18 V.S.A. § 9481.
Sec. 7. 18 V.S.A. chapter 221, subchapter 10 is amended to read:
Subchapter 10. Patient Financial Assistance and Medical Debt
