14 behaviors that can be addressed through support, counseling, change
15 techniques, coaching, and other interventions. As used in the Vermont Statutes
16 Annotated, the term does not include mental health conditions or substance use
17 disorders. The General Assembly recognizes that using the term “behavioral
18 health” to describe mental health conditions or substance use disorders has a
19 stigmatizing impact, which may deter individuals from seeking health care for
20 those conditions, but also recognizes that some jurisdictions interpret the term
21 to incorporate those conditions and that therefore it may be necessary under
VT LEG #382906 v.1

2 services for the sole reason of avoiding any question about the intended scope
3 of a specific statute.

7 (a) A credit reporting agency shall not report or maintain in the file on a
8 consumer information relating to a medical debt.
9 (b) As used in this section:
10 (1) “Health care services” means all supplies, care, and services of a
11 medical, dental, behavioral health, mental health, substance use disorder
12 treatment, surgical, psychiatric, therapeutic, diagnostic, preventative,
13 rehabilitative, or supportive nature, including medication.
14 (2) “Medical debt” means debt arising from health care services,
15 including dental services, or from health care goods, including products,
16 devices, durable medical equipment, and prescription drugs. “Medical debt”
17 does not include debt arising from services provided by a veterinarian; debt
18 charged to a credit card unless the credit card is issued under an open-end or
19 closed-end credit plan offered solely for the payment of health care services;
20 debt charged to a home equity or general-purpose line of credit; or secured
21 debt.
