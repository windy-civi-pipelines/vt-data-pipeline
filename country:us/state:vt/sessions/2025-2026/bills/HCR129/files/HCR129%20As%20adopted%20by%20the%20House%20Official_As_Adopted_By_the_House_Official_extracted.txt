Whereas, when considering the 19th-and early 20th-century highways and
byways of Vermont, one conjures up the image of a covered bridge connecting
two sides of a waterway or other traveling impediment within or between
communities and even across state lines, and
Whereas, at their apex, Vermont was home to more than 500 covered
bridges, but fires, floods, and the advancing age of these iconic and
magnificent edifices have reduced their presence to fewer than 100, and
Whereas, although the number of covered bridges in Vermont will never
return to its historic high point, the nonprofit and all-volunteer operated
Vermont Covered Bridge Society, established in 2000, is dedicated to
preserving those that still grace our communities, and
Whereas, the Vermont Covered Bridge Society has grown from just a few
enthusiasts to over 300 members from both the United States and Canada, and
its activities involve working directly with State agencies and local
communities to preserve and restore covered bridges, and
Whereas, another aspect of the Vermont Covered Bridge Society’s
endeavors is maintaining a lively virtual presence, with a website including
links to new stories; a picturesque tour of the State’s existing covered bridges;
a colorful exploration of the relatively recent phenomena of “romantic
shelters” that serve diverse purposes ranging from entrances to businesses,
beautifying a picnic area or playground, or, more practically, crossing short

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
