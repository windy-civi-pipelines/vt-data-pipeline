Whereas, spelling correctly is both an art and a science, requiring the knowledge of
the English language’s grammatical rules and the innumerable exceptions to every
spelling convention, and
Whereas, the challenge of spelling complex words correctly is tested in individual
schools, states, and nationally through students’ participation in the Scripps National
Spelling Bee, a venerable scholastic tradition, and 2025 marks the competition’s
centennial, and
Whereas, Phoenix Newell, a seventh grader at the Riverside School in Lyndonville,
has, for two consecutive years, exhibited a passion and a special talent for mastering the
nuances of spelling a sophisticated lexicon of words, and
Whereas, after innumerable hours of study and memorization, Phoenix Newell, then a
sixth grader, advanced through numerous rounds of school competition to earn the
opportunity to represent the Riverside School at the 2024 Vermont State Spelling Bee, at
which she out-spelled all the other contestants and was declared the champion, and
Whereas, this singular achievement entitled Phoenix Newell to advance to the Scripps
National Spelling Bee final in Washington, DC, and
Whereas, despite her best effort, Phoenix Newell was not recognized as the 2024
national spelling champion, but the excitement and thrill of being part of this nationwide
contest motivated her to try again as a seventh grader, and
Whereas, in 2025, Phoenix Newell’s determination, patience, and academic stamina
all contributed to her distinctive success in winning a second consecutive Vermont State
Spelling Bee, and she eagerly anticipates returning to our nation’s capital for her second
appearance at the Scripps National Spelling Bee, this time as a more experienced
contender, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates Phoenix Newell on winning two consecutive
Vermont State Spelling Bees, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Phoenix Newell.
