Section 1:
State of Vermont
House of Representatives
Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 101
Offered by Senator Ingalls
House concurrent resolution congratulating PhoenixNewell on winning two consecutive Vermont State
Spelling Bees
Whereas, spelling correctly is both an art and a science, requiring the knowledge of the English language’s
grammatical rules and the innumerable exceptions to every spelling convention, and
Whereas, the challenge of spelling complexwords correctly is tested in individual schools, states, and
nationally through students’ participation in the Scripps National Spelling Bee, a venerable scholastic tradition,
and 2025 marks the competition’s centennial, and
Whereas, PhoenixNewell, a seventh grader at the Riverside School in Lyndonville, has, for two consecutive
years, exhibited a passion and a special talent for mastering the nuances of spelling a sophisticated lexicon of
words, and
Whereas, after innumerable hours of study and memorization, PhoenixNewell, then a sixth grader, advanced
through numerous rounds of school competition to earn the opportunity to represent the Riverside School at the
2024 Vermont State Spelling Bee, at which she out-spelled all the other contestants and was declared the
champion, and
Whereas, this singular achievement entitled PhoenixNewell to advance to the Scripps National Spelling Bee
final in Washington, DC, and
Whereas, despite her best effort, PhoenixNewell was not recognized as the 2024 national spelling champion,
but the excitement and thrill of being part of this nationwide contest motivated her to try again as a seventh
grader, and
Whereas, in 2025, PhoenixNewell’s determination, patience, and academic stamina all contributed to her
distinctive success in winning a second consecutive Vermont State Spelling Bee, and she eagerly anticipates
returning to our nation’s capital for her second appearance at the Scripps National Spelling Bee, this time as a
more experienced contender, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates PhoenixNewell on winning two consecutive Vermont State
Spelling Bees, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to PhoenixNewell.
