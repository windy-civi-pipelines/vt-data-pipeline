organization that grew to 400,000 members and was instrumental in the creation of Memorial Day, and
Whereas, 116 GAR posts were established in Vermont, and GAR Post No. 10 in Cambridge village had over

and participate in community events that pay homage to our hero-ancestors, their deeds, and their
sacrifices,” and
Whereas, a new roadside historical marker will be dedicated on May 18, 2025 in the village of Cambridge
