12 of a high-risk sex offender who has failed to comply with Sex Offender
13 Registry requirements; to restrict the use of alternative sentences for repeat

17 public; to prohibit a court from reducing the sentence for a listed crime if the
18 defendant has a prior conviction for a listed crime; to outline the procedure to

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.411

4 statutory term of “recidivism” to adjust how recidivism is measured and create
5 new measures of criminal behavior; to increase the number of Big 14 offenses
6 that commence in the Criminal Division of the Superior Court rather than the

8 initiative for 19-year-old offenders; transfer jurisdiction over youthful offender

10 who has previously been found to have violated probation, been

10 * * * Bail * * *

13 consistent with State v. Sauve, 159 Vt. 566 (1993); State v. Gates, 2016 VT 36;
14 and their progeny so that repeated failures to appear in court, repeated
15 violations of conditions of release, and other violations of court orders
16 constitute a compelling State interest that falls within the statutory definition of
17 “disrupts the prosecution.”
18 Sec. 8. 13 V.S.A. § 7575 is amended to read:
19 § 7575. REVOCATION OF THE RIGHT TO BAIL

13 which, after hearing, probable cause is found.
14 (c) If the court revokes bail, it shall order the defendant’s immediate arrest
15 without a warrant if the person is within the State and declare any bond
16 pledged by the defendant forfeited.
17 (d)(1) If a defendant’s bail is revoked, the court shall set the defendant’s
18 case for trial not more than 60 days from the date of revocation.
19 (2) If the trial is not commenced within 60 days after revocation and the
20 delay is not attributable to the defense, the court shall immediately schedule a
21 bail hearing for the defendant.

13 Sec. 14. FINDINGS AND INTENT
14 (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds:
15 (1) The State’s current definition of recidivism is based upon offenders
16 who are sentenced to more than one year of incarceration and who, after
17 release, return to an incarcerative setting within three years, but only after
18 conviction of a new offense or a violation of Department of Corrections’
19 supervision and the new sentence for the violation is not fewer than 90 days.
20 (2) The vast majority of misdemeanor crimes have maximum terms of
21 imprisonment of not more than six months.

3 (4) Under current law, a person could commit 10 instances of retail theft

7 (b) Intent. It is the intent of the General Assembly that:

11 and of individual success.

5 approved by the department and which that may include a community justice
6 center or a balanced and restorative justice program. Referral to a community-
7 based provider pursuant to this subdivision shall not require the court to place
8 the child on probation. If the community-based provider does not accept the
9 case or if the child fails to complete the program in a manner deemed
10 satisfactory and timely by the provider, the child shall return to the court for
11 further proceedings, including the imposition of the disposition order.
12 (d)(1) The Department for Children and Families and the Department of
13 Corrections shall be responsible for supervision of and providing services to
14 the youth until the youth reaches 22 years of age the earlier of:

3 Sec. 28. 33 V.S.A. § 5285 is amended to read:
4 § 5285. MODIFICATION OR REVOCATION OF DISPOSITION
5 (a) If it appears that the youth has violated the terms of juvenile probation
6 ordered by the court pursuant to subdivision 5284(c)(1) of this title, a motion
7 for modification or revocation of youthful offender status may be filed in the
8 Family Division of the Superior Court. The court shall set the motion for
9 hearing as soon as practicable within 30 days. The hearing may be joined with
10 a hearing on a violation of conditions of probation under section 5265 of this
11 title. A Consistent with the procedures of 28 V.S.A. § 301, a supervising
12 juvenile or adult probation officer may detain in an adult facility a youthful
13 offender who has attained 18 years of age for violating conditions of probation.
14 A youthful offender who has not attained 18 years of age may be detained in a
15 facility for juveniles pursuant to section 5266 of this title. A youthful offender
16 who is detained prior to attaining 18 years of age may be transferred to an adult
17 facility after the offender attains 18 years of age.
18 (b) A hearing under this section shall be held in accordance with section
19 5268 of this title.

1 (1) maintain the youth’s status as a youthful offender, with modified
2 conditions of juvenile probation if the court deems it appropriate;
3 (2) revoke the youth’s status as a youthful offender and transfer the case
4 with a record of the petition, affidavit, adjudication, disposition, and revocation
5 to the Criminal Division for sentencing; or
6 (3) transfer supervision of the youth to the Department of Corrections
7 with all of the powers and authority of the Department and the Commissioner
8 under Title 28, including graduated sanctions and electronic monitoring.
9 (d) If a youth’s status as a youthful offender is revoked and the case is
10 transferred to the Criminal Division pursuant to subdivision (c)(2) of this
11 section, the court shall enter a conviction of guilty based on the admission to or
12 finding of merits, hold a sentencing hearing, and impose sentence. Unless it
13 serves the interest of justice, the case shall not be transferred back to the
14 Family Division pursuant to section 5203 of this title. When determining an
15 appropriate sentence, the court may take into consideration the youth’s degree
16 of progress toward or regression from rehabilitation while on youthful offender
17 status. The Criminal Division shall have access to all Family Division records
18 of the proceeding.

5 age. The hearing may be joined with a motion to terminate youthful offender
6 status under section 5285 of this title. The court shall provide notice and an
7 opportunity to be heard at the hearing to the State’s Attorney, the youth, the
8 Department for Children and Families, and the Department of Corrections.
9 (b) After receiving a notice of review under this section, the State may file
10 a motion to modify or revoke pursuant to section 5285 of this title. If such a
11 motion is filed, it shall be consolidated with the review under this section and
12 all options provided for under section 5285 of this title shall be available to the
13 court.
14 (c) The following reports shall be filed with the court prior to the hearing:
15 (1) The Department for Children and Families and the Department of
16 Corrections shall jointly report their recommendations, with supporting
17 justifications, as to whether the Family Division court should continue

17 public; to prohibit a court from reducing the sentence for a listed crime if the
18 defendant has a prior conviction for a listed crime; to outline the procedure to

19 all other procedure incidental to extradition proceedings, by executing or
20 subscribing in the presence of a judge of any court of record within this State a

13 Sec. 14. FINDINGS AND INTENT
14 (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds:
15 (1) The State’s current definition of recidivism is based upon offenders
16 who are sentenced to more than one year of incarceration and who, after
17 release, return to an incarcerative setting within three years, but only after
18 conviction of a new offense or a violation of Department of Corrections’
19 supervision and the new sentence for the violation is not fewer than 90 days.
20 (2) The vast majority of misdemeanor crimes have maximum terms of
21 imprisonment of not more than six months.

3 (4) Under current law, a person could commit 10 instances of retail theft

7 (b) Intent. It is the intent of the General Assembly that:

9 returns to incarceration, and probation violations and revocations; and
10 (2) the State establish a statutory measure of violent crime recidivism
11 and of individual success.
