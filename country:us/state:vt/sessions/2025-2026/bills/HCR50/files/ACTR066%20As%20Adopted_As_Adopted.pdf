No. R-66. House concurrent resolution recognizing the unique role of certified
registered nurse anesthetists in the Vermont health care system.
(H.C.R.50)
Offered by Representative Cordes of Bristol
Whereas, nurses have provided anesthesia to patients for over 150 years, and
Whereas, certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), also known as nurse
anesthetists, were originally designated in 1956, and they are advanced practice
registered nurses who are among the nation’s most trusted health care professionals, and
Whereas, nationally, nearly 74,000 CRNAs practice in every setting in which
anesthesia is delivered, including traditional hospital surgical suites; obstetrical delivery
rooms; ambulatory surgical centers; and at the offices of dentists, podiatrists,
ophthalmologists, and pain management specialists, and
Whereas, in Pub. L. 99-509 § 9320, Congress extended Medicare coverage to CRNA
services, and
Whereas, CRNAs are primary anesthesia providers in rural and underserved
communities and for U.S. military personnel, and
Whereas, based on their formal education, field training, board certification, and State
licensure, these health care professionals are qualified to make independent judgements
regarding a broad scope of anesthesia care, and
Whereas, CRNAs are trusted anesthesia experts, caring for patients safely and
compassionately, delivering specialized, cost-effective care to all patients—from
newborns to seniors—for every type of procedure in all kinds of facilities, and
Whereas, in addition to anesthesia care, CRNAs are qualified to address the unique
health care challenges of some of our sickest patients, including veterans, now therefore
be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly recognizes the unique role of certified registered nurse
anesthetists in the Vermont health care system, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the Vermont Association of Nurse Anesthetists.
