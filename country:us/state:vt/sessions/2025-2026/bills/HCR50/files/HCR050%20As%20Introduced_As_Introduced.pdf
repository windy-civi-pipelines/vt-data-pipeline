State of Vermont
House of Representatives
Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 50
Offered by Representative Cordes of Bristol
House concurrent resolution recognizing the unique role of certified registered nurse
anesthetists in the Vermont health care system
Whereas, nurses have provided anesthesia to patients for over 150 years, and
Whereas, certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), also known as nurse anesthetists,
were originally designated in 1956, and they are advanced practice registered nurses who are
among the nation’s most trusted health care professionals, and
Whereas, nationally, nearly 74,000 CRNAs practice in every setting in which anesthesia is
delivered, including traditional hospital surgical suites; obstetrical delivery rooms; ambulatory
surgical centers; and at the offices of dentists, podiatrists, ophthalmologists, and pain
management specialists, and
Whereas, in Pub. L. 99-509 § 9320, Congress extended Medicare coverage to CRNA
services, and
Whereas, CRNAs are primary anesthesia providers in rural and underserved communities and
for U.S. military personnel, and
Whereas, based on their formal education, field training, board certification, and State
licensure, these health care professionals are qualified to make independent judgements
regarding a broad scope of anesthesia care, and
Whereas, CRNAs are trusted anesthesia experts, caring for patients safely and
compassionately, delivering specialized, cost-effective care to all patients—from newborns to
seniors—for every type of procedure in all kinds of facilities, and
Whereas, in addition to anesthesia care, CRNAs are qualified to address the unique health
care challenges of some of our sickest patients, including veterans, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly recognizes the unique role of certified registered nurse
anesthetists in the Vermont health care system, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the
Vermont Association of Nurse Anesthetists.
