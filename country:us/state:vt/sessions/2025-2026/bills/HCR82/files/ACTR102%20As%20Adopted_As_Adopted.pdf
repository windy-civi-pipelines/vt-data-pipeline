Whereas, during the 2024–2025 season on the bowling lanes, the second-seeded Fair
Haven Slaters experienced its strongest challenge from the top-ranked Randolph Union
High Galloping Ghosts, and after defeating South Burlington and Essex in the quarter-
final and semifinal rounds, the Slaters confronted their archrival for the State title at the
Spare Time bowling facility in Colchester, and
Whereas, despite losing the opening game to Randolph (172–150), the Slaters
immediately rebounded, winning the second (161–146), the third (243–177), the fifth
(217–168), and the sixth (233–164), and with four victories, Fair Haven clinched the
best-of-seven final round and won the 2025 State bowling championship, and
Whereas, a caravan of over 20 cars greeted the victorious team in Castleton and
escorted the jubilant Slaters back to school, and
Whereas, the championship Slater bowlers were Wyatt DeLance, Aiden Goyette,
Nathan Bessette, Inshik Adams-Silva, Emma Eckler, Eli Donaldson, Dylan Bania,
Michael Towle, Korbin Hayes, George Stamp, Madison Stamp, and Amberlyn
Haley, and
Whereas, Head Coach Joe Donaldson and Assistant Coach Ron Carrrara were superb
guides for the team, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2025 Fair Haven Union High School
Slaters State championship bowling team, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Fair Haven Union High School.
