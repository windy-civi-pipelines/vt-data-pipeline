Sec. 9. VERMONT COMMUNITY RADIO GRANT PROGRAM
(a) Findings. The General Assembly finds that:
BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE AND SENATE H.397
2025 Page 24 of 57
(1) Vermont’s seven active community radio stations currently serve
over 200,000 Vermonters, many in rural and underserved areas.

information during emergencies, including Tropical Storm Irene, recent severe
flooding, and other natural disasters.

volunteer staff and listener donations, and are ineligible for federal funding
through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting due to their size.

(2) Community radio stations have consistently provided critical
information during emergencies, including Tropical Storm Irene, recent severe
flooding, and other natural disasters.
(3) These stations operate with small budgets, primarily relying on
volunteer staff and listener donations, and are ineligible for federal funding
through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting due to their size.
(4) Upcoming FCC-approved stations in Bristol, Richmond-Underhill-
Jericho, and Ludlow will expand coverage to nearly all Vermont counties,
increasing statewide accessibility to vital community radio services.
(5) Investment in these stations strengthens Vermont’s public safety
network and promotes civic engagement by providing local, hyper-focused
content that commercial and statewide media cannot replicate.

radio stations remain resilient and prepared to serve as lifelines during
emergencies while fostering local engagement and preserving Vermont’s
unique community fabric.

stations; and

currently under construction.
(4) To be eligible for a grant under the Program, an applicant shall:
(A) be a nonprofit, noncommercial community radio station licensed
in Vermont;
(B) demonstrate a history of providing emergency broadcasting
services or show the capacity to provide those services upon funding; and
(C) submit a detailed implementation plan for the proposed use of
grant funding.
