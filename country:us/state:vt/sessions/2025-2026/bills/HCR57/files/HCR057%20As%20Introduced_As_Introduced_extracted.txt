of Richmond, Virginia, and were forced to flee down the Virginia peninsula, young Johnston proved to be the
only drummer in his division to retain his instrument through the harrowing ordeal, and
Whereas, on September 16, 1863, when Willie Johnston was only 13 years of age, U.S. Secretary of War
Edwin Stanton presented him with this special medal, and he remains the youngest recipient to this day, and

the Indian Wars (1), the Philippines Campaign (1), interim periods (2), World War II (3), and the Vietnam War
(1), and
Whereas, Congress established National Medal of Honor Day, which was first observed in 1991, “to foster
public appreciation and recognition of Medal of Honor recipients,” now therefore be it
