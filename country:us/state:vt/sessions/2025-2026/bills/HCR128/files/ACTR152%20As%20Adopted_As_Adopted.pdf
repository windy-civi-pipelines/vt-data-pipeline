Whereas, the unhoused are our neighbors, community members, parents, children,
seniors, and people with disabilities, and
Whereas, the 2024 Point-in-Time Count report found that 3,458 Vermonters, including
737 children, were without secure housing, and
Whereas, according to the Vermont Housing Finance Agency’s most recent Vermont
Housing Needs Assessment, by 2029, Vermont will need 3,295 homes to address
homelessness and 3,957 homes to normalize vacancy rates, and
Whereas, on an evening in April 2025, Vermont’s statewide shelter capacity was 655
households, and all were full, and in addition, there were 1,424 homeless adults and 467
children housed through the General Assistance Emergency Housing Program, and
Whereas, Black Vermonters are significantly less likely to own their home and are
unhoused at a staggering rate compared with White Vermonters, and
Whereas, since 2020, the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board has invested in
affordable housing initiatives that have created 1,964 new rental units and 170 new
homes for sale, and supported 1,077 lots across 11 manufactured home communities, and
Whereas, today, May 6, 2025, individuals concerned with the issues associated with
unhoused Vermonters are visiting the State House to inform legislators on the impact of
homelessness on life in the State of Vermont, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly designates May 6, 2025 as Homelessness Awareness Day
in Vermont, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the Housing and Homelessness Alliance of Vermont.
