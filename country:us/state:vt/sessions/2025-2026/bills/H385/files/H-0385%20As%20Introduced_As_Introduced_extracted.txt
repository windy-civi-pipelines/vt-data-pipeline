9 actions within 10 business days following receipt:
10 (1) Cease all attempts to collect the coerced debt from the debtor.
11 (2) Refrain from filing any lawsuit to collect the coerced debt or, if a

11 all of the information required of a statement of coerced debt or provides an
12 oral statement of coerced debt without adequate documentation, the creditor

7 A-1 in English and Spanish.

14 the answer.

16 2. If you did sign or agree to the debt, was it because someone threatened
17 you or used intimidation, force, manipulation, theft, or other forms of control

2 (i) In connection with any communication related to a debtor’s statement of
3 coerced debt, the creditor:
4 (1) shall only use the contact information the debtor provides in the
5 statement of coerced debt to contact the debtor and shall not use any other
6 contact information;
7 (2) shall not disclose the contact information the debtor provides in the
8 statement of coerced debt to any other person, including the perpetrator of the
9 coerced debt or joint account holders, without the debtor’s express written
10 authorization; and
11 (3) may request that the debtor provide the identity of the perpetrator of
12 coerced debt, if known, and contact information for that person if known.
13 § 2495d. CIVIL LEGAL REMEDIES
14 (a) A debtor is not liable for coerced debt. A debtor may raise as a defense
15 in any forum and by any allowable procedure that a particular debt, or portion
16 thereof, is coerced debt.
17 (b) The debtor establishes a prima facie case that a debt is coerced debt by
18 providing a statement of coerced debt and adequate documentation. If the
19 creditor has a good faith basis to believe that the debt is not coerced debt, the
20 creditor may seek a court order in a court of competent jurisdiction declaring
VT LEG #379078 v.4
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.385
2025 Page 14 of 20
1 the debt is not a coerced debt. In such a suit, the creditor has the burden to
2 disprove the debt is coerced debt.
3 (c) A person who is found to be a perpetrator of coerced debt by a court of
4 competent jurisdiction shall be civilly liable to the creditor. The perpetrator of
5 coerced debt may also be civilly liable to the debtor to the extent that the
6 debtor made payments or incurred costs related to the coerced debt.
7 (d) A creditor may use all legal rights and remedies to collect the coerced
8 debt from the perpetrator of coerced debt.
9 (e) In any court action, the presiding court shall take appropriate steps
10 necessary to protect the debtor or an immediate family member of the debtor
11 from an alleged perpetrator of coerced debt by, among other things, sealing
12 court records, redacting personally identifiable information about the debtor
13 and any immediate family member of the debtor, and directing that any
14 deposition or evidentiary hearing be conducted remotely.
15 (f) Any creditor who fails to comply with any provision of section 2495c of
16 this subchapter is liable to the debtor in an amount equal to the sum of:
17 (1) any actual damages sustained by the debtor as a result of such
18 noncompliance;
19 (2)(A) in the case of any action by an individual, such additional
20 damages as the court may allow, but not exceeding $5,000.00 per violation
21 indexed annually for inflation; or
VT LEG #379078 v.4
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.385
2025 Page 15 of 20
1 (B) in the case of a class action:
2 (i) such amount for each named plaintiff as could be recovered
3 under subdivision (A) of this subdivision (f)(2); and
4 (ii) such amount as the court may allow for all other class
5 members, without regard to a minimum individual recovery, not to exceed the
6 lesser of $500,000.00 indexed annually for inflation or one per centum of the
7 net worth of the debt collector;
8 (iii) court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees as determined by
9 the court; and
10 (iv) punitive damages if the court finds the creditor’s
11 noncompliance was willful.
12 (g) The provisions of this subchapter apply to lawsuits filed in this State,
13 regardless of whether a related contract provides that the law of another state is
14 chosen.
15 § 2495e. CREDITOR REMEDIES
16 Nothing in this subchapter diminishes the rights of a creditor to seek
17 payment recovery for a coerced debt from the person who caused the debtor to
18 incur the coerced debt.

1 Sec. 2. DEBT COLLECTION RULES
2 On or before January 1, 2027, the Attorney General shall amend Vermont’s
3 Consumer Protection Rule 104 on Debt Collection to ensure debt collection
4 practices conform with the requirements of 9 V.S.A. chapter 63, subchapter 13.
5 Sec. 3. 9 V.S.A. § 2480d is amended to read:
6 § 2480d. PROCEDURE IN CASE OF DISPUTED ACCURACY
7 (a) If the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in
8 the consumer’s file is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the
9 credit reporting agency directly of such dispute, the agency shall reinvestigate
10 free of charge and record the current status of the disputed information on or
11 before 30 business days after the date the agency receives notice from the
12 consumer.
13 (b) On or before five business days after the date a credit reporting agency
14 receives notice of a dispute from a consumer in accordance with subsection (a)
15 of this section, the agency shall provide notice of the dispute to all persons who
16 provided any item of information in dispute.
17 (c) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a credit reporting agency
18 may terminate a reinvestigation of information disputed by a consumer under
19 such subsection if the agency reasonably determines that such dispute by the
20 consumer is frivolous or irrelevant. Upon making such a determination, a
21 credit reporting agency shall promptly notify the consumer of such
VT LEG #379078 v.4
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.385
2025 Page 17 of 20
1 determination and the reasons therefor, by mail, or if authorized by the
2 consumer for that purpose, by telephone. The presence of contradictory
3 information in the consumer’s file does not in and of itself constitute
4 reasonable grounds for determining the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant.
5 (d) In conducting a reinvestigation under subsection (a) of this section, the
6 credit reporting agency shall review and consider all relevant information
7 submitted by the consumer with respect to such disputed information.
8 (e) If, after a reinvestigation under subsection (a) of this section of any
9 information disputed by a consumer, the information is found to be inaccurate
10 or cannot be verified, the credit reporting agency shall promptly delete such
11 information from the consumer’s file. For purposes of this section,
12 “information” shall not include other information in the same item that is not
13 disputed by the consumer.
14 (f) If any information is deleted after a reinvestigation under subsection (a)
15 of this section, the information may not be reinserted in the consumer’s file
16 after deletion unless the person who furnishes the information reinvestigates
17 and states in writing or by electronic record to the agency that the information
18 is complete and accurate. Such furnisher shall not provide such statement
19 unless the furnisher reasonably believes that the information is complete and
20 accurate. Upon such reinvestigation and statement by the furnisher, the credit
21 reporting agency shall promptly notify the consumer of any reinsertion.
VT LEG #379078 v.4
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.385
2025 Page 18 of 20
1 (g) A credit reporting agency shall provide written notice of the results of
2 any reinvestigation under this subsection within five business days of
3 following the completion of the reinvestigation, by mail or, if authorized by the
4 consumer for that purpose, by telephone. This notice shall include:
5 (1) a statement that the reinvestigation is complete;
6 (2) a statement of the determination of the agency on the completeness
7 or accuracy of the disputed information;
8 (3) a credit report that is based upon the consumer’s file as that file is
9 revised as a result of the reinvestigation;
10 (4) a description of the manner in which the information disputed by the
11 consumer has been altered, changed, deleted, or modified in the consumer’s
12 credit report;
13 (5) a description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and
14 completeness of the information, including the name, business address, and, if
15 available, the telephone number of any person contacted in connection with
16 such information; and
17 (6) a notification that the consumer has the right, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.
18 § 1681i, to add a statement to the consumer’s file disputing the accuracy or
19 completeness of the information.
20 (h) If a consumer asserts that a debt or any portion of a debt is the result of
21 coerced debt as defined in subdivision 2495a(3) of this title and provides to the
VT LEG #379078 v.4
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.385
2025 Page 19 of 20
1 consumer reporting agency either a court order of relief pursuant to subsection
2 2495d(b) of this title or a statement of coerced debt as defined in subdivision
3 2495a(10) of this title and adequate documentation as defined in subdivision
4 2495a(2) of this title, the consumer reporting agency shall reinvestigate the
5 debt pursuant to this section. If after the reinvestigation it is determined that
6 the debt is the result of coerced debt, the consumer reporting agency shall
7 remove any reference to the debt or any portion of the debt determined to be
8 the result of coerced debt from the consumer’s credit report. As used in this
9 section, “statement of coerced debt” means a signed statement that includes:
10 (1) an assertion that the debtor is a survivor of domestic abuse,
11 economic abuse, or human trafficking;
12 (2) a recitation of the facts supporting the claim that the debt is coerced;
13 and
14 (3) if only a portion of the debt is claimed to be coerced debt, an
15 itemization of the portion of the debt that is claimed to be coerced debt.
16 Sec. 4. 9 V.S.A. § 2480k is amended to read:
17 § 2480k. COMPLAINTS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES
18 A person who has learned or reasonably suspects that his or her the person’s
19 personal identifying information has been unlawfully used by another, as
20 described in 13 V.S.A. § 2030(a) 2030, may make a complaint about the
21 unlawful use of personal identifying information to the State Police or to the
VT LEG #379078 v.4
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.385

1 person’s local law enforcement agency. The law enforcement agency shall
2 take the complaint and provide the complainant with a copy of the complaint,
3 the name of the law enforcement officer taking the complaint, and an incident
4 number or case number assigned to the complaint by the law enforcement
5 agency. If the suspected crime was committed in a different jurisdiction, the
6 law enforcement agency shall take the complaint and provide the complainant
7 with a copy of the complaint, the name of the law enforcement officer taking
8 the complaint, and an incident number or case number assigned to the
9 complaint by the law enforcement agency and refer the complaint to a law
10 enforcement agency in that different jurisdiction.
11 Sec. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE
12 This act shall take effect on July 1, 2026.

9 actions within 10 business days following receipt:
10 (1) Cease all attempts to collect the coerced debt from the debtor.

11 all of the information required of a statement of coerced debt or provides an
12 oral statement of coerced debt without adequate documentation, the creditor

2 (i) In connection with any communication related to a debtor’s statement of
3 coerced debt, the creditor:
4 (1) shall only use the contact information the debtor provides in the
5 statement of coerced debt to contact the debtor and shall not use any other
6 contact information;
7 (2) shall not disclose the contact information the debtor provides in the
8 statement of coerced debt to any other person, including the perpetrator of the
9 coerced debt or joint account holders, without the debtor’s express written
10 authorization; and
11 (3) may request that the debtor provide the identity of the perpetrator of
12 coerced debt, if known, and contact information for that person if known.
13 § 2495d. CIVIL LEGAL REMEDIES
14 (a) A debtor is not liable for coerced debt. A debtor may raise as a defense
15 in any forum and by any allowable procedure that a particular debt, or portion
16 thereof, is coerced debt.
17 (b) The debtor establishes a prima facie case that a debt is coerced debt by
18 providing a statement of coerced debt and adequate documentation. If the
19 creditor has a good faith basis to believe that the debt is not coerced debt, the
20 creditor may seek a court order in a court of competent jurisdiction declaring
VT LEG #379078 v.4

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.385
2025 Page 14 of 20
1 the debt is not a coerced debt. In such a suit, the creditor has the burden to
2 disprove the debt is coerced debt.
3 (c) A person who is found to be a perpetrator of coerced debt by a court of
4 competent jurisdiction shall be civilly liable to the creditor. The perpetrator of
5 coerced debt may also be civilly liable to the debtor to the extent that the
6 debtor made payments or incurred costs related to the coerced debt.
7 (d) A creditor may use all legal rights and remedies to collect the coerced
8 debt from the perpetrator of coerced debt.
9 (e) In any court action, the presiding court shall take appropriate steps
10 necessary to protect the debtor or an immediate family member of the debtor
11 from an alleged perpetrator of coerced debt by, among other things, sealing
12 court records, redacting personally identifiable information about the debtor
13 and any immediate family member of the debtor, and directing that any
14 deposition or evidentiary hearing be conducted remotely.
15 (f) Any creditor who fails to comply with any provision of section 2495c of
16 this subchapter is liable to the debtor in an amount equal to the sum of:
17 (1) any actual damages sustained by the debtor as a result of such
18 noncompliance;
19 (2)(A) in the case of any action by an individual, such additional
20 damages as the court may allow, but not exceeding $5,000.00 per violation
21 indexed annually for inflation; or
VT LEG #379078 v.4

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.385
2025 Page 15 of 20
1 (B) in the case of a class action:
2 (i) such amount for each named plaintiff as could be recovered
3 under subdivision (A) of this subdivision (f)(2); and
4 (ii) such amount as the court may allow for all other class
5 members, without regard to a minimum individual recovery, not to exceed the
6 lesser of $500,000.00 indexed annually for inflation or one per centum of the
7 net worth of the debt collector;
8 (iii) court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees as determined by
9 the court; and
10 (iv) punitive damages if the court finds the creditor’s
11 noncompliance was willful.
12 (g) The provisions of this subchapter apply to lawsuits filed in this State,
13 regardless of whether a related contract provides that the law of another state is
14 chosen.
15 § 2495e. CREDITOR REMEDIES
16 Nothing in this subchapter diminishes the rights of a creditor to seek
17 payment recovery for a coerced debt from the person who caused the debtor to
18 incur the coerced debt.

1 Sec. 2. DEBT COLLECTION RULES
2 On or before January 1, 2027, the Attorney General shall amend Vermont’s
3 Consumer Protection Rule 104 on Debt Collection to ensure debt collection
4 practices conform with the requirements of 9 V.S.A. chapter 63, subchapter 13.
5 Sec. 3. 9 V.S.A. § 2480d is amended to read:
6 § 2480d. PROCEDURE IN CASE OF DISPUTED ACCURACY
7 (a) If the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in
8 the consumer’s file is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the
9 credit reporting agency directly of such dispute, the agency shall reinvestigate
10 free of charge and record the current status of the disputed information on or
11 before 30 business days after the date the agency receives notice from the
12 consumer.
13 (b) On or before five business days after the date a credit reporting agency
14 receives notice of a dispute from a consumer in accordance with subsection (a)
15 of this section, the agency shall provide notice of the dispute to all persons who
16 provided any item of information in dispute.
17 (c) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a credit reporting agency
18 may terminate a reinvestigation of information disputed by a consumer under
19 such subsection if the agency reasonably determines that such dispute by the
20 consumer is frivolous or irrelevant. Upon making such a determination, a
21 credit reporting agency shall promptly notify the consumer of such
VT LEG #379078 v.4

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.385
2025 Page 17 of 20
1 determination and the reasons therefor, by mail, or if authorized by the
2 consumer for that purpose, by telephone. The presence of contradictory
3 information in the consumer’s file does not in and of itself constitute
4 reasonable grounds for determining the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant.
5 (d) In conducting a reinvestigation under subsection (a) of this section, the
6 credit reporting agency shall review and consider all relevant information
7 submitted by the consumer with respect to such disputed information.
8 (e) If, after a reinvestigation under subsection (a) of this section of any
9 information disputed by a consumer, the information is found to be inaccurate
10 or cannot be verified, the credit reporting agency shall promptly delete such
11 information from the consumer’s file. For purposes of this section,
12 “information” shall not include other information in the same item that is not
13 disputed by the consumer.
14 (f) If any information is deleted after a reinvestigation under subsection (a)
15 of this section, the information may not be reinserted in the consumer’s file
16 after deletion unless the person who furnishes the information reinvestigates
17 and states in writing or by electronic record to the agency that the information
18 is complete and accurate. Such furnisher shall not provide such statement
19 unless the furnisher reasonably believes that the information is complete and
20 accurate. Upon such reinvestigation and statement by the furnisher, the credit
21 reporting agency shall promptly notify the consumer of any reinsertion.
VT LEG #379078 v.4

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.385
2025 Page 18 of 20
1 (g) A credit reporting agency shall provide written notice of the results of
2 any reinvestigation under this subsection within five business days of
3 following the completion of the reinvestigation, by mail or, if authorized by the
4 consumer for that purpose, by telephone. This notice shall include:
5 (1) a statement that the reinvestigation is complete;
6 (2) a statement of the determination of the agency on the completeness
7 or accuracy of the disputed information;
8 (3) a credit report that is based upon the consumer’s file as that file is
9 revised as a result of the reinvestigation;
10 (4) a description of the manner in which the information disputed by the
11 consumer has been altered, changed, deleted, or modified in the consumer’s
12 credit report;
13 (5) a description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and
14 completeness of the information, including the name, business address, and, if
15 available, the telephone number of any person contacted in connection with
16 such information; and
17 (6) a notification that the consumer has the right, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.
18 § 1681i, to add a statement to the consumer’s file disputing the accuracy or
19 completeness of the information.
20 (h) If a consumer asserts that a debt or any portion of a debt is the result of
21 coerced debt as defined in subdivision 2495a(3) of this title and provides to the
VT LEG #379078 v.4

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.385
2025 Page 19 of 20
1 consumer reporting agency either a court order of relief pursuant to subsection
2 2495d(b) of this title or a statement of coerced debt as defined in subdivision
3 2495a(10) of this title and adequate documentation as defined in subdivision
4 2495a(2) of this title, the consumer reporting agency shall reinvestigate the
5 debt pursuant to this section. If after the reinvestigation it is determined that
6 the debt is the result of coerced debt, the consumer reporting agency shall
7 remove any reference to the debt or any portion of the debt determined to be
8 the result of coerced debt from the consumer’s credit report. As used in this
9 section, “statement of coerced debt” means a signed statement that includes:
10 (1) an assertion that the debtor is a survivor of domestic abuse,
11 economic abuse, or human trafficking;
12 (2) a recitation of the facts supporting the claim that the debt is coerced;
13 and
14 (3) if only a portion of the debt is claimed to be coerced debt, an
15 itemization of the portion of the debt that is claimed to be coerced debt.
16 Sec. 4. 9 V.S.A. § 2480k is amended to read:
17 § 2480k. COMPLAINTS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES
18 A person who has learned or reasonably suspects that his or her the person’s
19 personal identifying information has been unlawfully used by another, as
20 described in 13 V.S.A. § 2030(a) 2030, may make a complaint about the
21 unlawful use of personal identifying information to the State Police or to the

2 take the complaint and provide the complainant with a copy of the complaint,
3 the name of the law enforcement officer taking the complaint, and an incident
4 number or case number assigned to the complaint by the law enforcement
5 agency. If the suspected crime was committed in a different jurisdiction, the
6 law enforcement agency shall take the complaint and provide the complainant
7 with a copy of the complaint, the name of the law enforcement officer taking
8 the complaint, and an incident number or case number assigned to the
9 complaint by the law enforcement agency and refer the complaint to a law
10 enforcement agency in that different jurisdiction.
