6 to reports of alleged neglect or abuse that occurred in Vermont and to out-of-
7 state conduct when the child is a resident of or is present in Vermont.
8 (b) If the report is accepted as a valid allegation of abuse or neglect, the

12 an investigation within 72 hours after the receipt of a report made pursuant to
13 section 4914 of this title, provided that it has sufficient information to proceed.
14 The Commissioner may waive the 72-hour requirement only when necessary
15 to locate the child who is the subject of the allegation or to ensure the safety of
16 the child or social worker.
17 (c) The decision to conduct an assessment shall include consideration of
18 the following factors:
19 (1) the nature of the conduct and the extent of the child’s injury, if any;

21 thereof; and

7 a child’s welfare involving or resulting in abandonment, child fatality,
8 malicious punishment, or abuse or neglect that causes serious physical injury.
9 The Department may conduct an investigation of any report.
10 (e) The Department shall begin an immediate investigation if, at any time
11 during an assessment, it appears that an investigation is appropriate.
12 (f) The Department may shall collaborate with child protection, law
13 enforcement, child advocacy centers, empaneled multidisciplinary teams
14 pursuant to section 4917 of this title, and other departments and agencies
15 entities in Vermont and other jurisdictions to evaluate risk to a child and to
