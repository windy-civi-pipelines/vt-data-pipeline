1 (2) legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the State, federal, or
2 international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value
3 of cryptocurrency;
4 (3) transactions in cryptocurrency may be irreversible and, accordingly,
5 losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable;
6 (4) the value of cryptocurrency may be derived from the continued
7 willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for
8 cryptocurrency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss
9 of value of a particular cryptocurrency should the market for the
10 cryptocurrency disappear; and
11 (5) the volatility and unpredictability of the price of cryptocurrency
12 relative to fiat currency may result in significant loss over a short period of
13 time.
14 (b) It is the intent of this act to establish regulatory policies that safeguard
15 public funds, protect consumers from fraudulent activities, promote the public
