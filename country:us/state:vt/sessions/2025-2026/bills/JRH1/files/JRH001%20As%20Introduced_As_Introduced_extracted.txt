Joint House Resolution
J.R.H. 1
Offered by Representative Higley of Lowell
United States Constitution
Whereas, the founders of our Constitution empowered State Legislators to be guardians of liberty
against future abuses of power by the federal government, and
Whereas, the federal government has created a crushing national debt through improper and
imprudent spending, and
Whereas, the federal government has invaded the legitimate roles of the states through the
manipulative process of federal mandates, most of which are unfunded to a great extent, and
Whereas, the federal government has ceased to live under a proper interpretation of the Constitution
of the United States, and
Whereas, it is the solemn duty of the States to protect the liberty of our people—particularly for the
generations to come—by proposing Amendments to the Constitution of the United States through a
Convention of the States under Article V for the purpose of restraining these and related abuses of
power, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly of the State of Vermont hereby applies to Congress under the provisions
of Article V of the Constitution of the United States, and be it further
Resolved: That the General Assembly requests that the convention of the States be limited to
proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United States that impose fiscal restraints on the
federal government, limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government, and limit the terms of
office for its officials and for members of Congress, and be it further
Resolved: That this application constitutes a continuing application in accordance with Article V of
the Constitution of the United States until the legislatures of at least two-thirds of the several states have
made applications on the same subject, and be it further
