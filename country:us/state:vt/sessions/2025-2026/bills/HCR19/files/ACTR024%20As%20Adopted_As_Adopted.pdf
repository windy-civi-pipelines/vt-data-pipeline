establishing a new one-year world vertical skiing record of 3,590,097 feet.
(H.C.R.19)
Offered by Representatives Lipsky of Stowe, Morrow of Weston, Bos-Lun of
Westminster, Durfee of Shaftsbury, Hango of Berkshire, Harple of Glover, Hunter of
Manchester, Kleppner of Burlington, Lalley of Shelburne, Masland of Thetford, McCoy
of Poultney, Morgan, L. of Milton, North of Ferrisburgh, O'Brien of Tunbridge, Priestley
of Bradford, Sheldon of Middlebury, Tagliavia of Corinth, Torre of Moretown, Wells of
Brownington, and White of Waitsfield
Whereas, uphill or vertical skiing entails different modes of energy and exertion than a
downhill traverse, and when a skier accumulates millions of feet in the condensed time
frame of one year, the stamina and strength required is most impressive, and
Whereas, Vermonter Noah Dines set out to establish a new world record for the most
number of feet skied vertically in a single year, an ambitious goal since the existing
record, set in 2016, was 2,500,000 feet, and
Whereas, the mileage required to meet his objective was undeniably daunting, but
Noah Dines was hardly deterred; he pursued this project with the utmost enthusiasm, and
Whereas, he commenced this endeavor on his home mountain in Stowe, ascending
upwards nearly 10,000 feet each day, plus the requisite descent necessitated to complete
each round trip, and
Whereas, realizing that year-round snow, not merely the limited months it was
accessible in Stowe, was essential for his mission, Noah Dines traveled within the United
States to Colorado, Oregon, and Utah, and abroad to Austria, Chile, and France, and
Whereas, in pursuit of his target, Noah Dines maximized three pairs of ski boots, five
sets of skis, and 12 pairs of skins, and
Whereas, in September 2024, Noah Dines broke the then-existing 2,500,000-foot
record, but he was hardly finished, as his original hope was to ski 3,000,000 feet, and
Whereas, he far exceeded that mark, concluding on December 30, 2024, having skied
vertically 3,590,097 feet, with supporting statistics of 6,082 total miles and 2,268.34 total
hours skied, and having averaged a daily 9,836 vertical feet, 6.13 hours, 16.66 miles, and
1.8 bags of candy, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates Vermonter Noah Dines on establishing a
new one-year world vertical skiing record of 3,590,097 feet, the equivalent of 120 ascents
of Mount Everest, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Noah Dines.
