House concurrent resolution congratulating Vermonter Noah Dines on establishing a new one-year world
vertical skiing record of 3,590,097 feet
Whereas, uphill or vertical skiing entails different modes of energy and exertion than a downhill traverse,
and when a skier accumulates millions of feet in the condensed time frame of one year, the stamina and strength
required is most impressive, and
Whereas, Vermonter Noah Dines set out to establish a new world record for the most number of feet skied
vertically in a single year, an ambitious goal since the existing record, set in 2016, was 2,500,000 feet, and
Whereas, the mileage required to meet his objective was undeniably daunting, but Noah Dines was hardly
deterred; he pursued this project with the utmost enthusiasm, and
Whereas, he commenced this endeavor on his home mountain in Stowe, ascending upwards nearly 10,000
feet each day, plus the requisite descent necessitated to complete each round trip, and
Whereas, realizing that year-round snow, not merely the limited months it was accessible in Stowe, was
essential for his mission, Noah Dines traveled within the United States to Colorado, Oregon, and Utah, and
abroad to Austria, Chile, and France, and
Whereas, in pursuit of his target, Noah Dines maximized three pairs of ski boots, five sets of skis, and 12
pairs of skins, and
Whereas, in September 2024, Noah Dines broke the then-existing 2,500,000-foot record, but he was hardly
finished, as his original hope was to ski 3,000,000 feet, and
Whereas, he far exceeded that mark, concluding on December 30, 2024, having skied vertically 3,590,097
feet, with supporting statistics of 6,082 total miles and 2,268.34 total hours skied, and having averaged a daily
9,836 vertical feet, 6.13 hours, 16.66 miles, and 1.8 bags of candy, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates Vermonter Noah Dines on establishing a new one-year world
vertical skiing record of 3,590,097 feet, the equivalent of 120 ascents of Mount Everest, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to Noah Dines.
