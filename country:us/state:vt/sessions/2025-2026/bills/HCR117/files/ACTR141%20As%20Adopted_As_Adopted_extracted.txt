teacher Andrew Kasprisin on his designation as the 2025 Vermont finalist for the
Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching.
(H.C.R.117)
Offered by Representatives McCann of Montpelier, Brady of Williston, Brown of
Richmond, Conlon of Cornwall, Dodge of Essex, Dolan of Essex Junction, Garofano of
Essex, Harple of Glover, Houghton of Essex Junction, Hunter of Manchester, and Long
of Newfane
Whereas, since Congress established this program in 1983, the Presidential Awards for
Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching (PAEMST), which the National
Science Foundation (NSF) administers on behalf of the Office of the President and the
White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), has been the federal
government’s highest recognition for K–12 math and science teachers, and
Whereas, PAEMST recognizes the importance of elementary and secondary school
educators in encouraging students to pursue mathematics, engineering, computer science,
and natural science education in the classroom and as a potential career, and
Whereas, jurisdictional finalists for this prestigious honor are selected through a
rigorous review process in each state, the District of Columbia, American territories, and
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and
Whereas, the 2025 PAEMST Vermont finalist is Essex Middle School science teacher
Andrew Kasprisin, a distinguished public educator, whose teaching excellence at the
Vermont Academy of Science and Engineering has been previously recognized, and
Whereas, Andrew Kasprisin directs his students to examine topics as if they were
scientists and not merely reading information from a book, and he poses questions to the
students that guide them through an innovative applied learning process, incorporating
real-world phenomena, and
Whereas, this exemplary practitioner of secondary school science pedagogy is a
superb choice for designation as the Vermont finalist, and
Whereas, once the jurisdictional finalists are selected, the NSF convenes a national
selection committee; the committee then evaluates the finalists and recommends two per
jurisdiction (assuming the jurisdiction had a minimum of two finalists) to the OSTP for
national finalist recognition; and the national finalists attend a special conference in
Washington, DC, which has historically featured a presidential event, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates Essex Middle School science teacher
Andrew Kasprisin on his designation as the 2025 Vermont finalist for the Presidential
Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Andrew Kasprisin.
