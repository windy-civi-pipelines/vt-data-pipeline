House concurrent resolution congratulating EssexMiddle School science teacher Andrew Kasprisin on his
designation as the 2025 Vermont finalist for the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science
Teaching
Whereas, since Congress established this program in 1983, the Presidential Awards for Excellence in
Mathematics and Science Teaching (PAEMST), which the National Science Foundation (NSF) administers on
behalf of the Office of the President and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP),
has been the federal government’s highest recognition for K–12 math and science teachers, and
Whereas, PAEMST recognizes the importance of elementary and secondary school educators in encouraging
students to pursue mathematics, engineering, computer science, and natural science education in the classroom
and as a potential career, and
Whereas, jurisdictional finalists for this prestigious honor are selected through a rigorous review process in
each state, the District of Columbia, American territories, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and
Whereas, the 2025 PAEMST Vermont finalist is EssexMiddle School science teacher Andrew Kasprisin, a
distinguished public educator, whose teaching excellence at the Vermont Academy of Science and Engineering
has been previously recognized, and
Whereas, Andrew Kasprisin directs his students to examine topics as if they were scientists and not merely
reading information from a book, and he poses questions to the students that guide them through an innovative
applied learning process, incorporating real-world phenomena, and
Whereas, this exemplary practitioner of secondary school science pedagogy is a superb choice for
designation as the Vermont finalist, and
Whereas, once the jurisdictional finalists are selected, the NSF convenes a national selection committee; the
committee then evaluates the finalists and recommends two per jurisdiction (assuming the jurisdiction had a
minimum of two finalists) to the OSTP for national finalist recognition; and the national finalists attend a
special conference in Washington, DC, which has historically featured a presidential event, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates EssexMiddle School science teacher Andrew Kasprisin on his
designation as the 2025 Vermont finalist for the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science
Teaching, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to Andrew Kasprisin.
