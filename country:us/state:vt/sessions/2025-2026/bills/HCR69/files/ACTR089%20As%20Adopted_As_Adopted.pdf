Whereas, the percentage of Vermont high school students pursuing postsecondary
education has declined significantly in recent years, and
Whereas, an important antidote to this trend is the Early College Program (ECP) that
enables high school students simultaneously to complete their senior year and freshman
year of college, and
Whereas, the enactment of 2013 Acts and Resolves No. 77, “An act… encouraging
flexible pathways to secondary school completion,” updated Vermont’s long history of
offering alternative methods to achieve high school graduation, and this act was designed
to improve postsecondary readiness and enrollment, and
Whereas, the ECP established in Act 77 represents approximately 0.4 percent of the
expenditures from the Education Fund, and it is intended to encourage postsecondary
education enrollment among students who might not otherwise consider this option, and
Whereas, demonstrable gains have occurred during the past three years in the
equitable admission of students into the ECP at the Community College of Vermont,
including a 250 percent increase in the enrollment of students with low income, and
Whereas, Vermont associate degree graduates are among the most likely in the
country to realize a positive return on their investment, a figure that stands at 79 percent
according to the Strada Education Foundation, and
Whereas, the ECP has a major influence in directing the personal postsecondary
education and career aspirations of the State’s students, and it prospectively strengthens
the future Vermont workforce, and
Whereas, today, April 2, 2025, ECP enrollees who are studying at the Community
College of Vermont are visiting the State House, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly designates April 2, 2025 as Early College Day at the State
House, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the president of the Community College of Vermont and the Secretary of Education.
