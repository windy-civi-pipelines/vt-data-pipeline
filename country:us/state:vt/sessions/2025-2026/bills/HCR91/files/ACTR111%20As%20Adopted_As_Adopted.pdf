Whereas, the most enduring boys’ basketball rivalry in Vermont, matching the top-
seeded Burlington Seahorses against the second-ranked Rice Memorial High School
Green Knights, was renewed in 2025 in all its glory at the University of Vermont’s
Patrick Gymnasium, and
Whereas, the emotional level this year was raised considerably with 2024’s leading
Rice scorer now assuming the same role for Burlington and achieving 29 points, the most
any individual player has scored in the Division I season’s finale since 1994, and
Whereas, Burlington, which retained the lead for nearly the entire game, built a 27–22
halftime lead into a 64–60 game triumph, and
Whereas, the exuberant Seahorses were Graham McNeil, Pascal Munezero, Ben Koh,
Mohamed Abdirahman, Khamis Ali, Abdi Sharif, Byron Robertson Jr., Leander Buckley,
Michee Kasongo, Chris Thompson, Hayden McConville, Tyrell Robertson, Colton
Bramhall, Sawyer Judkins, Jimmy Homsted, and Miles Kenny, and
Whereas, Head Coach B.J. Robertson; assistant coaches Kevin Garrison, John
O’Brien, and Deng Adiang; and managers Caleb Ploof, Mustafa Khudaier, and Tobey
Bernabe were each fantastic throughout the 2024–2025 season, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2025 Burlington High School Seahorses
Division I championship boys’ basketball team, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Burlington High School.
