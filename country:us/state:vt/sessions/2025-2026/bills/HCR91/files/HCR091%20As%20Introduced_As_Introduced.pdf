House concurrent resolution congratulating the 2025 Burlington High School Seahorses Division I
championship boys’ basketball team
Whereas, the most enduring boys’ basketball rivalry in Vermont, matching the top-seeded Burlington
Seahorses against the second-ranked Rice Memorial High School Green Knights, was renewed in 2025
in all its glory at the University of Vermont’s Patrick Gymnasium, and
Whereas, the emotional level this year was raised considerably with 2024’s leading Rice scorer now
assuming the same role for Burlington and achieving 29 points, the most any individual player has
scored in the Division I season’s finale since 1994, and
Whereas, Burlington, which retained the lead for nearly the entire game, built a 27–22 halftime lead
into a 64–60 game triumph, and
Whereas, the exuberant Seahorses were Graham McNeil, Pascal Munezero, Ben Koh, Mohamed
Abdirahman, Khamis Ali, Abdi Sharif, Byron Robertson Jr., Leander Buckley, Michee Kasongo,
Chris Thompson, Hayden McConville, Tyrell Robertson, Colton Bramhall, Sawyer Judkins, Jimmy
Homsted, and Miles Kenny, and
Whereas, Head Coach B.J. Robertson; assistant coaches Kevin Garrison, John O’Brien, and Deng
Adiang; and managers Caleb Ploof, Mustafa Khudaier, and Tobey Bernabe were each fantastic
throughout the 2024–2025 season, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2025 Burlington High School Seahorses Division I
championship boys’ basketball team, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to Burlington
High School.
