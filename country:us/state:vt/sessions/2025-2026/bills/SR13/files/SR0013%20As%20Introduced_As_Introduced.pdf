S.R. 13. Senate resolution relating to strongly objecting to the manner and
circumstances under which U.S. immigration authorities arrested and detained Mohsen
Mahdawi and strongly advocating that he be afforded due process under the law and
released immediately from detention.
Whereas, Mohsen Mahdawi is a resident of White River Junction and has been a U.S.
permanent resident (green card holder) for the past decade, and
Whereas, on Monday, April 14, 2025, in the belief that he was to participate in his final
interview for U.S. citizenship, Mohsen Mahdawi arrived at the U.S. immigration office in
Colchester, and
Whereas, instead of commencing the interview, armed immigration authorities in plain
clothes with faces covered arrested Mohsen Mahdawi and refused to provide any
information regarding where he was being taken or what would happen to him, and
Whereas, in a joint statement that U.S. Senators Sanders and Welch and U.S.
Representative Balint released, they described this action as “immoral, inhumane, and
illegal,” and
Whereas, Vermont’s three federal legislators also demanded that Mohsen Mahdawi be
afforded “due process under the law and immediately released from detention,” now
therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate:
That the Senate of the State of Vermont strongly objects to the manner and
circumstances under which U.S. immigration authorities arrested and detained Mohsen
Mahdawi and strongly advocate that he be afforded due process under the law and released
immediately from detention, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of the Senate be directed to send a copy of this resolution
to U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, Immigration and Customs
Enforcement Acting Director Todd Lyons, and the Vermont Congressional Delegation.
