J.R.S. 15. Joint resolution supporting Vermont's transgender and non-binary
community and declaring Vermont's commitment to fighting discrimination and
treating all citizens with respect and dignity.
Whereas, Vermont is deeply committed to the principles of equity and inclusion
and values the transgender and non-binary individuals in our community, and
Whereas, Vermont has been a leader in establishing policies that prohibit
discrimination based on gender identity, enacting broad protections in law in the
areas of employment, housing, education, banking, and public accommodations, and
Whereas, Vermont enacted legislation permitting individuals to amend their vital
records to accurately reflect and affirm their gender identities, and
Whereas, Vermont recently enacted comprehensive legislation to affirm the right
of individuals to obtain essential gender-affirming medical care and to protect those
individuals, their families, and their health care providers from legal attacks initiated
outside our State, and
Whereas, Vermont unequivocally rejects any attempt to stigmatize, devalue, and
discriminate against individuals based on their gender identity and is committed to
ensuring that transgender and non-binary individuals living in, working in, or
visiting our State receive equal protection under the laws of our State, now
therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly recommits to the principle that all individuals are
welcome here and deserve to be treated with dignity and respect and that Vermont
will continue to stand with our transgender and non-binary family, friends, and
neighbors against discrimination, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution
to the Pride Center of Vermont and Outright Vermont.
