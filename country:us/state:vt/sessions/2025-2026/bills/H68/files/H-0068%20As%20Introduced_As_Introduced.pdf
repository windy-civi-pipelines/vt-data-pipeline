13 institution, the benefit shall be the in-state tuition rate charged by UVM.
14 (3) For courses at an eligible training institution offering nondegree,
15 certificate training, or continuing education programs, the benefit shall be the
16 lower of the institution’s standard tuition or the in-state tuition rate charged by
17 UVM.
18 (4) For courses at a non-Vermont approved postsecondary education

1 (b) Tuition benefit.
2 (1) The tuition benefit provided under the Program shall be paid on
3 behalf of the member by the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation
4 (VSAC), subject to the appropriation of funds by the General Assembly
5 specifically for this purpose. An eligible Vermont postsecondary institution
6 that accepts or receives the tuition benefit on behalf of a member shall charge
7 the member the tuition rate for an in-state student. The amount of tuition for a
8 member who attends an educational institution under the Program on less than
9 a full-time basis shall be reduced to reflect the member’s course load in a
10 manner determined by VSAC under subdivision (f)(1) of this section.
11 (2) The tuition benefit shall be conditioned upon the member’s
12 executing a promissory note obligating the member to repay the member’s
13 tuition benefit, in whole or in part, if the member fails to complete the period
14 of Vermont National Guard service required in subsection (d) of this section,
15 or if the member’s benefit is terminated pursuant to subdivision (e)(1) of this
16 section. If the member is pursuing a graduate degree under the Program, the
17 member shall agree in the promissory note to, upon receipt of the graduate
18 degree and until the individual’s service commitment under subsection (d) of
19 this section is satisfied, be employed full time in Vermont or, if unemployed,
20 be actively seeking full-time employment in Vermont.
