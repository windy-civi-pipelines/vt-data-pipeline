12 assessor for the municipality shall certify the original taxable value and shall
13 certify to the legislative body in each year thereafter during the life of the
14 housing development site the amount by which the total valuation as

19 or assessor shall include not more than the original taxable value of the real
20 property in the assessed valuation upon which the treasurer computes the rates
21 of all taxes levied by the municipality and every other taxing district in which
VT LEG #383831 v.1

SENATE PROPOSAL OF AMENDMENT H.479
2025 Page 52 of 60
1 the housing development site is situated, but the treasurer shall extend all rates
2 so determined against the entire assessed valuation of real property for that

7 (d) Annually throughout the life of the housing development site, the
8 municipality shall hold apart, rather than remit to the taxing districts, that
9 proportion of all taxes paid that year on the real property within the housing
10 development site that the excess valuation bears to the total assessed valuation.
11 The amount held apart each year is the “tax increment” for that year. The tax
12 increment shall only be used for financing and related costs.
13 (e) Not more than the percentages established pursuant to section 1910c of
14 this subchapter of the municipal and State education tax increments received
15 with respect to the housing development site and committed for the payment
16 for financing for improvements and related costs shall be segregated by the
17 municipality in a special tax increment financing account and in its official
18 books and records until all capital indebtedness incurred for the housing
19 infrastructure project has been fully paid. The final payment shall be reported
20 to the treasurer, who shall thereafter include the entire assessed valuation of the
21 housing development site in the assessed valuations upon which the municipal
VT LEG #383831 v.1

SENATE PROPOSAL OF AMENDMENT H.479

5 taxes assessed within a housing development site shall be subject to the
6 provisions of this section. Special assessments levied under chapter 76A or 87
7 of this title or under a municipal charter shall not be considered property taxes
8 for the purpose of this section if the proceeds are used exclusively for
9 operating expenses related to properties within the housing development site
10 and not for improvements within the housing development site.
11 § 1910c. USE OF TAX INCREMENT; RETENTION PERIOD

4 municipal property tax increment may be retained, beginning the first year in
5 which debt is incurred for the housing infrastructure project.

12 (B) to place in a special tax increment financing account required
13 pursuant to subsection 1910b(e) of this subchapter and use for future financing
14 payments; or
15 (C) to use for defeasance of the financing.
16 (2) Any remaining portion of the excess education property tax
17 increment shall be distributed to the Education Fund. Any remaining portion
18 of the excess municipal property tax increment shall be distributed to the city,
19 town, or village budget in the proportion that each budget bears to the
20 combined total of the budgets unless otherwise negotiated by the city, town, or
21 village.
