increment shall only be used for financing and related costs.

(c) On or before January 15, 2035, the Vermont Economic Progress
Council shall submit a report to the Senate Committees on Economic
Development, Housing and General Affairs and on Finance and the House
Committees on Commerce and Economic Development and on Ways and
Means evaluating the success of the Community and Housing Infrastructure
Program in achieving its purpose, as stated in section 1907 of this chapter,
including by identifying the amount and kinds of housing produced through
the Program and by determining whether housing development pursued
through the Program meets the project criterion and location criteria of section
1910 of this chapter.

§ 1910e. AUDITING
Annually on or before April 1 until the year following the end of the period
for retention of education property tax increment, a municipality with a
housing infrastructure project approved under this subchapter shall ensure that
the special tax increment financing account required by section 1910b of this
subchapter is subject to the annual audit prescribed in section 1681 or 1690 of
this title and submit a copy to the Vermont Economic Progress Council. If an
account is subject only to the audit under section 1681 of this title, the Council
shall ensure a process is in place to subject the account to an independent
audit. Procedures for the audit must include verification of the original taxable
value and annual and total municipal and education property tax increments
generated, expenditures for financing and related costs, and current balance.
§ 1910f. GUIDANCE
(a) The Secretary of Commerce and Community Development, after
reasonable notice to a municipality and an opportunity for a hearing, may issue
decisions to a municipality on questions and inquiries concerning the
administration of housing infrastructure projects, statutes, rules,
noncompliance with this subchapter, and any instances of noncompliance
identified in audit reports conducted pursuant to section 1910e of this
subchapter.
(b) The Vermont Economic Progress Council shall prepare
recommendations for the Secretary of Commerce and Community
Development prior to any decision issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this
section. The Council may prepare recommendations in consultation with the
Commissioner of Taxes, the Attorney General, and the State Treasurer. In
preparing recommendations, the Council shall provide a municipality with a
reasonable opportunity to submit written information in support of its position.
(c) The Secretary of Commerce and Community Development shall review
the recommendations of the Council and issue a final written decision on each
matter within 60 days following receipt of the recommendations. The
Secretary may permit an appeal to be taken by any party to a Superior Court
for determination of questions of law in the same manner as the Supreme
Court may by rule provide for appeals before final judgment from a Superior
Court before issuing a final decision.
(d) The Vermont Economic Progress Council may adopt rules that are
reasonably necessary to implement this subchapter.

necessary to permit new surface water direct discharges of domestic
wastewater in Vermont, identifying funding sources available to support the
construction of such projects, and any recommendations for improving or
streamlining the process.
