Act No. 62 (S.63). An act relating to modifying the regulatory duties of the Green
Mountain Care Board
Subjects: Health; Green Mountain Care Board; accountable care organizations;
hospital budgets; health information technology
This act eliminates certain regulatory duties of the Green Mountain Care Board
(GMCB), including duties to review and approve the statewide Health Information
Technology Plan, the criteria for health care providers to create or maintain connectivity
to the State’s health information exchange network, and the annual budget of the
Vermont Information Technology Leaders. The act modifies the GMCB billback
formula to eliminate the eight percent allocation for accountable care organizations
(ACOs) and to increase the allocations for hospitals and health insurers accordingly. The
act expands the scope of ACOs that must be certified in order to operate in Vermont from
only those that receive payments from Medicaid or commercial insurance through a
payment reform program to any ACO that operates in Vermont. It modifies and
simplifies the criteria that must be met for the GMCB to certify an ACO and allows the
GMCB to adopt rules creating a streamlined certification process for Medicare-only
ACOs. The act also eliminates existing ACO budget review provisions, creates new
budget review criteria for ACOs that accept payments from Medicaid or commercial
insurance, or both, and establishes fees for ACO certification and budget review.
The act allows private psychiatric hospitals to operate on a fiscal year that aligns with
the calendar year, rather than the October 1 to September 30 fiscal year that applies to
other hospitals. The act specifies that the GMCB’s review, establishment, and
enforcement of hospital budgets should not be construed to be a contested case under the
Administrative Procedures Act, but that anyone aggrieved by a final GMCB action,
order, or determination, including an enforcement decision, may appeal pursuant to the
GMCB’s existing appeal statute. The act also modifies the scope of requirements
regarding meetings of an ACO’s governing body to apply only to an ACO that contracts
with Vermont Medicaid and it eliminates a requirement that the GMCB annually review
any all-inclusive population-based payment arrangement between the Department of
Vermont Health Access and an ACO and issue an advisory opinion.
