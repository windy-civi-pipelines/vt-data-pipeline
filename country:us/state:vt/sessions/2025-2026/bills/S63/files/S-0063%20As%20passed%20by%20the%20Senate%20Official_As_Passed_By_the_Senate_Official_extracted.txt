1 S.63
2 Introduced by Senators Lyons, Cummings and Gulick
3 Referred to Committee on Health and Welfare
4 Date: February 11, 2025
5 Subject: Health; Green Mountain Care Board; health information technology;
6 accountable care organizations; hospital budgets
7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to eliminate the
8 Green Mountain Care Board’s responsibility for approving the State’s Health
9 Information Technology Plan, for reviewing the budget of the Vermont
10 Information Technology Leaders, and for conducting Medicaid advisory rate
11 cases. The bill would modify the scope of the Green Mountain Care Board’s
12 certification of accountable care organizations and its review of their budgets
13 and would limit the application of provisions regarding meetings of
14 accountable care organization governing bodies to only the accountable care
15 organizations that contract with Vermont Medicaid. The bill would establish
16 fees for accountable care board certification and budget review and would
17 remove accountable care organizations from the billback formula under which
18 Board expenses are allocated in part to other regulated entities. The bill would
19 also specify that the Board’s review, establishment, and enforcement of
20 hospital budgets includes the right to the Board’s appeals processes and does
21 not constitute a contested case under the Administrative Procedures Act.

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.63

1 S.63
2 Introduced by Senators Lyons, Cummings and Gulick
3 Referred to Committee on Health and Welfare
4 Date: February 11, 2025
5 Subject: Health; Green Mountain Care Board; health information technology;
6 accountable care organizations; hospital budgets
7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to eliminate the
8 Green Mountain Care Board’s responsibility for approving the State’s Health
9 Information Technology Plan, for reviewing the budget of the Vermont
10 Information Technology Leaders, and for conducting Medicaid advisory rate
11 cases. The bill would modify the scope of the Green Mountain Care Board’s
12 certification of accountable care organizations and its review of their budgets
13 and would limit the application of provisions regarding meetings of
14 accountable care organization governing bodies to only the accountable care
15 organizations that contract with Vermont Medicaid. The bill would establish
16 fees for accountable care board certification and budget review and would
17 remove accountable care organizations from the billback formula under which
18 Board expenses are allocated in part to other regulated entities. The bill would
19 also specify that the Board’s review, establishment, and enforcement of
20 hospital budgets includes the right to the Board’s appeals processes and does
21 not constitute a contested case under the Administrative Procedures Act.

6 (C) The Plan shall include standards and protocols designed to

1 pilot programs, and following approval of the proposed updates by the Green
2 Mountain Care Board, may enter into a contract or grant agreement with

14 (d) The Health Information Technology Plan shall serve as the framework
15 within which the Green Mountain Care Board reviews certificate of need
16 applications for information technology under section 9440b of this title. In
17 addition, the Commissioner of Information and Innovation Secretary of Digital
18 Services shall use the Health Information Technology Plan as the basis for
