2 § 8002. DEFINITIONS
3 As used in this chapter:
4 * * *
5 (17) “New renewable energy” means renewable energy capable of
6 delivery in New England and produced by a specific and identifiable plant
7 coming into service on or after January 1, 2010, but excluding energy
8 generated by a hydroelectric generation plant with a capacity of 200 MW or
9 greater.
10 * * *
11 (B) Except as provided in subdivision 8005(c)(3) of this title, “new
12 “New renewable energy” also includes the additional energy from an existing
13 renewable energy plant retrofitted with advanced technologies or otherwise
14 operated, modified, or expanded to increase the kWh output of the plant in
15 excess of a historical baseline established by calculating the average output of
16 that plant for the 10-year period that ended January 1, 2010. If the production
17 of new renewable energy through changes in operations, modification, or
18 expansion involves combustion of the resource, the system also must result in
19 an incrementally higher level of energy conversion efficiency or significantly
20 reduced emissions.
