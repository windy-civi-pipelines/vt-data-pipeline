Section 1:
State of Vermont
House of Representatives
Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 28
Offered by Senators Brock and Norris
House concurrent resolution congratulating the 2024 Bellows Free Academy-FairfaxHigh
School Bullets Division III championship baseball team
Whereas, based on their respective rankings, the sixth-seeded Bellows Free Academy-Fairfax
Bullets and the fifth-seeded White River Valley Wildcats Division III baseball championship
showdown at Centennial Field in Burlington should have resulted in a score of narrow
difference, and
Whereas, the reality proved entirely different as the Bullets were the undeniably superior
team as they both offensively and defensively overwhelmed the Wildcats, and
Whereas, the Bullets quickly displayed their baseball prowess, as they established a 3–0 lead
in the first inning, increased their scoring advantage to 4–0 in the second, 5–0 in the fourth; and
widened their lead to 7–0 in the fifth, which they sustained until the final out, and
Whereas, the energized Bullets, who returned home triumphantly with their school’s first
baseball title since 2015, were MaxClark, Tyler Gillilan, Rylan Muehl, Trent Hurley, Braydon
Gillilan, Kayden Lovejoy, Xavier Gillilan, Reagan Baumeister, Teddy Colling, Dylan Sicard,
Ryan Sheehan, Chase Murray, Alden Kalbfleisch, Unai Laskurain, Kris Mummert, James
Benjamin, and Bryant Matton, and
Whereas, Head Coach Mike Brown and assistant coaches Chris Cowey, Bruce Gillilan, and
Mitch Thayer, as well as statistician Victoria Brown and scorekeeper Peyton Metruk, were each
thrilled with this victory, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2024 Bellows Free Academy-FairfaxHigh
School Bullets Division III championship baseball team, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to Bellows
Free Academy-FairfaxHigh School.
