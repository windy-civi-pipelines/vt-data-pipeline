Whereas, based on their respective rankings, the sixth-seeded Bellows Free Academy-
Fairfax Bullets and the fifth-seeded White River Valley Wildcats Division III baseball
championship showdown at Centennial Field in Burlington should have resulted in a
score of narrow difference, and
Whereas, the reality proved entirely different as the Bullets were the undeniably
superior team as they both offensively and defensively overwhelmed the Wildcats, and
Whereas, the Bullets quickly displayed their baseball prowess, as they established a 3–
0 lead in the first inning, increased their scoring advantage to 4–0 in the second, 5–0 in
the fourth; and widened their lead to 7–0 in the fifth, which they sustained until the final
out, and
Whereas, the energized Bullets, who returned home triumphantly with their school’s
first baseball title since 2015, were Max Clark, Tyler Gillilan, Rylan Muehl, Trent
Hurley, Braydon Gillilan, Kayden Lovejoy, Xavier Gillilan, Reagan Baumeister, Teddy
Colling, Dylan Sicard, Ryan Sheehan, Chase Murray, Alden Kalbfleisch, Unai Laskurain,
Kris Mummert, James Benjamin, and Bryant Matton, and
