7 Date:
8 Subject: Corrections; facilities; private; for-profit; prohibition
9 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to restrict the
10 Commissioner of Corrections’ authority to assign and transfer persons in the
11 custody of the Department of Corrections by only permitting the assignment
12 and transfer of such persons to facilities operated by public or nonprofit
13 entities and pursuant to an interstate or federal compact. The bill further
14 proposes that the Department of Corrections create an implementation plan to
15 repatriate incarcerated individuals housed out of state back to Vermont.
16 An act relating to prohibiting the use of private and for-profit correctional
17 facilities
18 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
19 Sec. 1. FINDINGS AND INTENT
20 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
VT LEG #380474 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.191
2025 Page 2 of 6
1 (1) The population of inmates in Vermont has risen from approximately
2 300 detainees per day in 2020 to approximately 500 detainees per day in 2024
3 while the sentenced population has remained relatively stable during the same
4 time period.
5 (2) Housing individuals in an out-of-state correctional facility is not a
6 temporary solution and results in a long-term costly and unsustainable practice
7 for the State.
8 (3) Sending individuals out of state discourages visits from family and
9 friends. Studies have shown a correlation between visitation and reduced
10 recidivism upon completion of prison time.
11 (4) Incarcerated individuals housed out of state have restricted access to
12 legal counsel, resulting in an increased reliance on telecommunication. This
13 additional burden subjects prisoners and those who wish to contact them to
14 exorbitant correctional facility phone rates.
15 (5) The State is unable to provide the same level of oversight and care
16 for incarcerated individuals held at out-of-state correctional facilities.
17 (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly that, by 2034, Vermont’s
18 practice of housing incarcerated individuals in privately operated, for-profit, or
19 out-of-state correctional facilities shall be prohibited so that corporations are
20 not enriched for depriving the liberty of persons sentenced to imprisonment. It
21 is the further intent of the General Assembly that such a prohibition does not
