5 Sec. 4. 9 V.S.A. chapter 63, subchapter 11 is amended to read:
6 Subchapter 11. Pregnancy Services Centers Health Care Services
7 § 2491. FINDINGS; LEGISLATIVE INTENT
8 (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds that:
9 (1) Centers that seek to counsel clients against abortion, often referred to
10 as crisis pregnancy centers or limited-services pregnancy centers, have become
11 common across the country, including in Vermont. Accurate information
12 about the services that a limited-services pregnancy center performs, in
13 addition to forthright acknowledgement of its limitations, is essential to enable
14 individuals in this State to make informed decisions about their care. This
15 includes individuals being informed of whether they are receiving services
16 from a licensed and qualified health care provider at a limited-services
17 pregnancy center, as this allows individuals to determine if they need to seek
18 medical care elsewhere in order to continue or terminate a pregnancy.
19 (2) Although some limited-services pregnancy centers openly
20 acknowledge in their advertising, on their websites, and at their facilities that
21 they neither provide abortions nor refer clients to other providers of abortion
VT LEG #383082 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.28
2025 Page 5 of 26
1 services, others provide confusing and misleading information to pregnant
2 individuals contemplating abortion by leading those individuals to believe that
3 their facilities offer abortion services and unbiased counseling. Some limited-
4 services pregnancy centers have promoted patently false or biased medical
5 claims about abortion, pregnancy, contraception, and reproductive health care
6 providers.
7 (3) False and misleading advertising by centers that do not offer or refer
8 clients for abortion is of special concern to the State because of the time-
9 sensitive and constitutionally protected nature of the decision to continue or
10 terminate a pregnancy. When a pregnant individual is misled into believing
11 that a center offers services that it does not in fact offer or receives false or
12 misleading information regarding health care options, the individual loses time
13 crucial to the decision whether to terminate a pregnancy and may lose the
14 option to choose a particular method or to terminate a pregnancy at all.
15 (4) Telling the truth is how trained health care providers demonstrate
16 respect for patients, foster trust, promote self-determination, and cultivate an
17 environment where best practices in shared decision-making can flourish.
18 Without veracity in information and communication, it is difficult for
19 individuals to make informed, voluntary choices that are essential to one’s
20 sense of personal agency and autonomy.
VT LEG #383082 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE S.28
2025 Page 6 of 26
1 (5)(2) Advertising strategies and educational information about health
2 care options that lack transparency, use misleading or ambiguous terminology,
3 misrepresent or obfuscate services provided, or provide factually inaccurate
4 information are a form of manipulation that disrespects individuals,
5 undermines trust, broadens health disparity, and can result in patient harm.
6 (b) Intent.
7 (1) It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that the public is
8 provided with accurate, factual information about the types of health care
9 services that are available to pregnant individuals in this State. The General
10 Assembly respects the constitutionally protected right of each individual to
11 personal reproductive autonomy, which includes the right to receive clear,
12 honest, and nonmisleading information about the individual’s options and to
13 make informed, voluntary choices after considering all relevant information.
14 (2) The General Assembly respects the right of limited-services
15 pregnancy centers to counsel individuals against abortion, and nothing in this
16 subchapter should be construed to regulate, limit, or curtail such advocacy.
17 § 2492. DEFINITIONS DEFINITION
18 As used in this subchapter:,
19 (1) “Abortion” means any medical treatment intended to induce the
20 termination of, or to terminate, a clinically diagnosable pregnancy except for

15 (a) It is an unfair and deceptive act and practice in commerce and a
16 violation of section 2453 of this title for any limited-services pregnancy center
17 person to disseminate or cause to be disseminated to the public any advertising
18 about the health care services or proposed services performed at that center in
19 this State that is untrue or clearly designed to mislead the public about the

1 medium, such as newspapers, magazines, mailers, or handouts; and any
2 broadcast medium, such as television or radio, telephone marketing, or
3 advertising over the Internet internet such as through websites and, web ads
4 advertisements, and social media. For purposes of this chapter, advertising or
5 the provision of services by a limited-services pregnancy center about health
6 care services is an act in commerce.

8 the Vermont Statutes Annotated who are employed by, contracted to provide
9 services for or on behalf of, or volunteer to provide services at a limited-
10 services pregnancy center shall be responsible for conducting and providing

13 Vermont Statutes Annotated to conduct or to ensure that health care services,
14 information, and counseling at the limited-services pregnancy services center
15 are conducted in accordance with State law and professional standards of

17 V.S.A. § 1354. [Repealed.]
18 (c) The Attorney General has the same authority to make rules, conduct
19 civil investigations, and bring civil actions with respect to violations of
