2 Introduced by Senators Hardy, Lyons, Clarkson, Gulick, Vyhovsky and White
3 Referred to Committee on
4 Date:
5 Subject: Health; health care professionals; legally protected health care;
6 limited-services pregnancy centers; Consumer Protection Act;
7 unprofessional conduct; medication abortions; fetal death reports
8 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to expand the
9 prohibition on untrue or misleading advertising by a limited-services
10 pregnancy center under the Consumer Protection Act to apply to any untrue or
11 misleading advertising about health care services. It would eliminate specific
12 responsibility for licensed health care providers who provide services at a
13 limited-services pregnancy center for the services provided at the center and
14 would remove language indicating that failure to ensure those services are
15 conducted in accordance with the law could constitute unprofessional conduct.
16 The bill would also clarify and expand the types of actions that could be
17 considered unprofessional conduct for physicians, physician assistants,
18 advanced practice registered nurses, and naturopathic physicians under their
19 licensure statutes. The bill would eliminate restrictions on a physician,
20 physician assistant, or advanced practice registered nurse prescribing
21 medication to terminate an individual’s pregnancy based on asynchronous
VT LEG #379226 v.1

1 electronic or other online communication with the individual. It would also
2 specify that fetal death reports required by law must be kept confidential.
3 An act relating to access to certain legally protected health care services
4 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
5 Sec. 1. 9 V.S.A. chapter 63, subchapter 11 is amended to read:
6 Subchapter 11. Pregnancy Services Centers Health Care Services
7 § 2491. FINDINGS; LEGISLATIVE INTENT
8 (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds that:
9 (1) Centers that seek to counsel clients against abortion, often referred to
10 as crisis pregnancy centers or limited-services pregnancy centers, have become
11 common across the country, including in Vermont. Accurate information
12 about the services that a limited-services pregnancy center performs, in
13 addition to forthright acknowledgement of its limitations, is essential to enable
14 individuals in this State to make informed decisions about their care. This
15 includes individuals being informed of whether they are receiving services
16 from a licensed and qualified health care provider at a limited-services
17 pregnancy center, as this allows individuals to determine if they need to seek
18 medical care elsewhere in order to continue or terminate a pregnancy.
19 (2) Although some limited-services pregnancy centers openly
20 acknowledge in their advertising, on their websites, and at their facilities that
VT LEG #379226 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.28
2025 Page 3 of 22
1 they neither provide abortions nor refer clients to other providers of abortion
2 services, others provide confusing and misleading information to pregnant
3 individuals contemplating abortion by leading those individuals to believe that
4 their facilities offer abortion services and unbiased counseling. Some limited-
5 services pregnancy centers have promoted patently false or biased medical
6 claims about abortion, pregnancy, contraception, and reproductive health care
7 providers.
8 (3) False and misleading advertising by centers that do not offer or refer
9 clients for abortion is of special concern to the State because of the time-
10 sensitive and constitutionally protected nature of the decision to continue or
11 terminate a pregnancy. When a pregnant individual is misled into believing
12 that a center offers services that it does not in fact offer or receives false or
13 misleading information regarding health care options, the individual loses time
14 crucial to the decision whether to terminate a pregnancy and may lose the
15 option to choose a particular method or to terminate a pregnancy at all.
16 (4) Telling the truth is how trained health care providers demonstrate
17 respect for patients, foster trust, promote self-determination, and cultivate an
18 environment where best practices in shared decision-making can flourish.
19 Without veracity in information and communication, it is difficult for
20 individuals to make informed, voluntary choices that are essential to one’s
21 sense of personal agency and autonomy.
VT LEG #379226 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED S.28
2025 Page 4 of 22
1 (5)(2) Advertising strategies and educational information about health
2 care options that lack transparency, use misleading or ambiguous terminology,
3 misrepresent or obfuscate services provided, or provide factually inaccurate
4 information are a form of manipulation that disrespects individuals,
5 undermines trust, broadens health disparity, and can result in patient harm.
6 (b) Intent.
7 (1) It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that the public is
8 provided with accurate, factual information about the types of health care
9 services that are available to pregnant individuals in this State. The General
10 Assembly respects the constitutionally protected right of each individual to
11 personal reproductive autonomy, which includes the right to receive clear,
12 honest, and nonmisleading information about the individual’s options and to
13 make informed, voluntary choices after considering all relevant information.
14 (2) The General Assembly respects the right of limited-services
15 pregnancy centers to counsel individuals against abortion, and nothing in this
16 subchapter should be construed to regulate, limit, or curtail such advocacy.
17 § 2492. DEFINITIONS DEFINITION
18 As used in this subchapter:,

16 (a) It is an unfair and deceptive act and practice in commerce and a
17 violation of section 2453 of this title for any limited-services pregnancy center
18 person to disseminate or cause to be disseminated to the public any advertising

1 directly to consumers; marketing practices; communication in any print
2 medium, such as newspapers, magazines, mailers, or handouts; and any
3 broadcast medium, such as television or radio, telephone marketing, or
4 advertising over the Internet internet such as through websites and, web ads

7 care services is an act in commerce.

9 the Vermont Statutes Annotated who are employed by, contracted to provide

14 Vermont Statutes Annotated to conduct or to ensure that health care services,

18 V.S.A. § 1354. [Repealed.]
19 (c) The Attorney General has the same authority to make rules, conduct
20 civil investigations, and bring civil actions with respect to violations of
