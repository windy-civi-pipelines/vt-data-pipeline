Sec. 4. 9 V.S.A. chapter 63, subchapter 11 is amended to read:
Subchapter 11. Pregnancy Services Centers Health Care Services

Section 4:
§ 2491. FINDINGS; LEGISLATIVE INTENT
(a) Findings. The General Assembly finds that:
(1) Centers that seek to counsel clients against abortion, often referred to
as crisis pregnancy centers or limited-services pregnancy centers, have become
common across the country, including in Vermont. Accurate information
about the services that a limited-services pregnancy center performs, in
addition to forthright acknowledgement of its limitations, is essential to enable
individuals in this State to make informed decisions about their care. This
includes individuals being informed of whether they are receiving services
from a licensed and qualified health care provider at a limited-services
pregnancy center, as this allows individuals to determine if they need to seek
medical care elsewhere in order to continue or terminate a pregnancy.
(2) Although some limited-services pregnancy centers openly
acknowledge in their advertising, on their websites, and at their facilities that
they neither provide abortions nor refer clients to other providers of abortion
services, others provide confusing and misleading information to pregnant
VT LEG #383719 v.1
No. 20 Page 5 of 25
2025
individuals contemplating abortion by leading those individuals to believe that
their facilities offer abortion services and unbiased counseling. Some limited-
services pregnancy centers have promoted patently false or biased medical
claims about abortion, pregnancy, contraception, and reproductive health care
providers.
(3) False and misleading advertising by centers that do not offer or refer
clients for abortion is of special concern to the State because of the time-
sensitive and constitutionally protected nature of the decision to continue or
terminate a pregnancy. When a pregnant individual is misled into believing
that a center offers services that it does not in fact offer or receives false or
misleading information regarding health care options, the individual loses time
crucial to the decision whether to terminate a pregnancy and may lose the
option to choose a particular method or to terminate a pregnancy at all.
(4) Telling the truth is how trained health care providers demonstrate
respect for patients, foster trust, promote self-determination, and cultivate an
environment where best practices in shared decision-making can flourish.
Without veracity in information and communication, it is difficult for
individuals to make informed, voluntary choices that are essential to one’s
sense of personal agency and autonomy.
(5)(2) Advertising strategies and educational information about health
care options that lack transparency, use misleading or ambiguous terminology,
misrepresent or obfuscate services provided, or provide factually inaccurate
VT LEG #383719 v.1
No. 20 Page 6 of 25
2025
information are a form of manipulation that disrespects individuals,
undermines trust, broadens health disparity, and can result in patient harm.
(b) Intent.
(1) It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that the public is
provided with accurate, factual information about the types of health care
services that are available to pregnant individuals in this State. The General
Assembly respects the constitutionally protected right of each individual to
personal reproductive autonomy, which includes the right to receive clear,
honest, and nonmisleading information about the individual’s options and to
make informed, voluntary choices after considering all relevant information.
(2) The General Assembly respects the right of limited-services
pregnancy centers to counsel individuals against abortion, and nothing in this
subchapter should be construed to regulate, limit, or curtail such advocacy.

Section 5:

§ 2493. UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE ACT
(a) It is an unfair and deceptive act and practice in commerce and a

this State that is untrue or clearly designed to mislead the public about the
nature of the services provided. Advertising includes representations made

medium, such as newspapers, magazines, mailers, or handouts; and any

health care professional certified, registered, or licensed under Title 26 of the
Vermont Statutes Annotated to conduct or to ensure that health care services,
information, and counseling at the limited-services pregnancy services center
are conducted in accordance with State law and professional standards of
practice may constitute unprofessional conduct under 3 V.S.A. § 129a and 26
V.S.A. § 1354. [Repealed.]
(c) The Attorney General has the same authority to make rules, conduct
civil investigations, and bring civil actions with respect to violations of

Sec. 4. 9 V.S.A. chapter 63, subchapter 11 is amended to read:
Subchapter 11. Pregnancy Services Centers Health Care Services
§ 2491. FINDINGS; LEGISLATIVE INTENT
(a) Findings. The General Assembly finds that:
(1) Centers that seek to counsel clients against abortion, often referred to
as crisis pregnancy centers or limited-services pregnancy centers, have become
common across the country, including in Vermont. Accurate information
about the services that a limited-services pregnancy center performs, in
addition to forthright acknowledgement of its limitations, is essential to enable
individuals in this State to make informed decisions about their care. This
includes individuals being informed of whether they are receiving services
from a licensed and qualified health care provider at a limited-services
pregnancy center, as this allows individuals to determine if they need to seek
medical care elsewhere in order to continue or terminate a pregnancy.
(2) Although some limited-services pregnancy centers openly
acknowledge in their advertising, on their websites, and at their facilities that
they neither provide abortions nor refer clients to other providers of abortion
services, others provide confusing and misleading information to pregnant
VT LEG #383719 v.1

No. 20 Page 5 of 25
2025
individuals contemplating abortion by leading those individuals to believe that
their facilities offer abortion services and unbiased counseling. Some limited-
services pregnancy centers have promoted patently false or biased medical
claims about abortion, pregnancy, contraception, and reproductive health care
providers.
(3) False and misleading advertising by centers that do not offer or refer
clients for abortion is of special concern to the State because of the time-
sensitive and constitutionally protected nature of the decision to continue or
terminate a pregnancy. When a pregnant individual is misled into believing
that a center offers services that it does not in fact offer or receives false or
misleading information regarding health care options, the individual loses time
crucial to the decision whether to terminate a pregnancy and may lose the
option to choose a particular method or to terminate a pregnancy at all.
(4) Telling the truth is how trained health care providers demonstrate
respect for patients, foster trust, promote self-determination, and cultivate an
environment where best practices in shared decision-making can flourish.
Without veracity in information and communication, it is difficult for
individuals to make informed, voluntary choices that are essential to one’s
sense of personal agency and autonomy.
(5)(2) Advertising strategies and educational information about health
care options that lack transparency, use misleading or ambiguous terminology,
misrepresent or obfuscate services provided, or provide factually inaccurate
VT LEG #383719 v.1

No. 20 Page 6 of 25
2025
information are a form of manipulation that disrespects individuals,
undermines trust, broadens health disparity, and can result in patient harm.
(b) Intent.
(1) It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that the public is
provided with accurate, factual information about the types of health care
services that are available to pregnant individuals in this State. The General
Assembly respects the constitutionally protected right of each individual to
personal reproductive autonomy, which includes the right to receive clear,
honest, and nonmisleading information about the individual’s options and to
make informed, voluntary choices after considering all relevant information.
(2) The General Assembly respects the right of limited-services
pregnancy centers to counsel individuals against abortion, and nothing in this
subchapter should be construed to regulate, limit, or curtail such advocacy.
§ 2492. DEFINITIONS DEFINITION

(1) “Abortion” means any medical treatment intended to induce the
termination of, or to terminate, a clinically diagnosable pregnancy except for
the purpose of producing a live birth.

sonograms, or prenatal care to pregnant individuals or has the appearance of a

both.

medium, such as newspapers, magazines, mailers, or handouts; and any
broadcast medium, such as television or radio, telephone marketing, or
advertising over the Internet internet such as through websites and, web ads

the provision of services by a limited-services pregnancy center about health
care services is an act in commerce.
(b) Health care providers certified, registered, or licensed under Title 26 of
the Vermont Statutes Annotated who are employed by, contracted to provide

health care professional certified, registered, or licensed under Title 26 of the
Vermont Statutes Annotated to conduct or to ensure that health care services,
information, and counseling at the limited-services pregnancy services center
are conducted in accordance with State law and professional standards of
