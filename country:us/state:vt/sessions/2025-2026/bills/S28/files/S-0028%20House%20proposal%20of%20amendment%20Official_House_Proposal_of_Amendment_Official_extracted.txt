Subchapter 11. Pregnancy Services Centers Health Care Services

Section 4:
§ 2491. FINDINGS; LEGISLATIVE INTENT
(a) Findings. The General Assembly finds that:
(1) Centers that seek to counsel clients against abortion, often referred
to as crisis pregnancy centers or limited-services pregnancy centers, have
become common across the country, including in Vermont. Accurate
information about the services that a limited-services pregnancy center
performs, in addition to forthright acknowledgement of its limitations, is
essential to enable individuals in this State to make informed decisions about
their care. This includes individuals being informed of whether they are
receiving services from a licensed and qualified health care provider at a
limited-services pregnancy center, as this allows individuals to determine if
they need to seek medical care elsewhere in order to continue or terminate a
pregnancy.
(2) Although some limited-services pregnancy centers openly
acknowledge in their advertising, on their websites, and at their facilities that
they neither provide abortions nor refer clients to other providers of abortion
services, others provide confusing and misleading information to pregnant
individuals contemplating abortion by leading those individuals to believe that
their facilities offer abortion services and unbiased counseling. Some limited-
services pregnancy centers have promoted patently false or biased medical
claims about abortion, pregnancy, contraception, and reproductive health care
providers.
(3) False and misleading advertising by centers that do not offer or refer
clients for abortion is of special concern to the State because of the time-
sensitive and constitutionally protected nature of the decision to continue or
terminate a pregnancy. When a pregnant individual is misled into believing
that a center offers services that it does not in fact offer or receives false or
misleading information regarding health care options, the individual loses time
crucial to the decision whether to terminate a pregnancy and may lose the
option to choose a particular method or to terminate a pregnancy at all.
(4) Telling the truth is how trained health care providers demonstrate
respect for patients, foster trust, promote self-determination, and cultivate an
environment where best practices in shared decision-making can flourish.
Without veracity in information and communication, it is difficult for
individuals to make informed, voluntary choices that are essential to one’s
sense of personal agency and autonomy.
(5)(2) Advertising strategies and educational information about health
care options that lack transparency, use misleading or ambiguous terminology,
misrepresent or obfuscate services provided, or provide factually inaccurate
information are a form of manipulation that disrespects individuals,
undermines trust, broadens health disparity, and can result in patient harm.
(b) Intent.
(1) It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that the public is
provided with accurate, factual information about the types of health care
services that are available to pregnant individuals in this State. The General
Assembly respects the constitutionally protected right of each individual to
personal reproductive autonomy, which includes the right to receive clear,
honest, and nonmisleading information about the individual’s options and to
make informed, voluntary choices after considering all relevant information.
(2) The General Assembly respects the right of limited-services
pregnancy centers to counsel individuals against abortion, and nothing in this
subchapter should be construed to regulate, limit, or curtail such advocacy.

Section 5:
§ 2492. DEFINITIONS DEFINITION
As used in this subchapter:,
(1) “Abortion” means any medical treatment intended to induce the
termination of, or to terminate, a clinically diagnosable pregnancy except for
the purpose of producing a live birth.
(2) “Client” means an individual who is inquiring about or seeking
services at a pregnancy services center.
(3) “Emergency contraception” means any drug approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration as a contraceptive method for use after sexual

(4) “Health information” means any oral or written information in any
form or medium that relates to health insurance or the past, present, or future
physical or mental health or condition of a client.
(5) “Limited-services pregnancy center” means a pregnancy services
center that does not directly provide, or provide referrals to clients for,
abortions or emergency contraception.

sonograms, or prenatal care to pregnant individuals or has the appearance of a
medical facility. A pregnancy services center has the appearance of a medical

both.

uniforms.

Section 6:
§ 2493. UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE ACT
(a) It is an unfair and deceptive act and practice in commerce and a
violation of section 2453 of this title for any limited-services pregnancy center
person to disseminate or cause to be disseminated to the public any advertising
about the health care services or proposed services performed at that center in
this State that is untrue or clearly designed to mislead the public about the
nature of the services provided. Advertising includes representations made
directly to consumers; marketing practices; communication in any print
medium, such as newspapers, magazines, mailers, or handouts; and any
broadcast medium, such as television or radio, telephone marketing, or
advertising over the Internet internet such as through websites and, web ads
advertisements, and social media. For purposes of this chapter, advertising or
the provision of services by a limited-services pregnancy center about health
care services is an act in commerce.

the Vermont Statutes Annotated who are employed by, contracted to provide
services for or on behalf of, or volunteer to provide services at a limited-
services pregnancy center shall be responsible for conducting and providing
health care services, information, and counseling at the center. The failure of a
health care professional certified, registered, or licensed under Title 26 of the
Vermont Statutes Annotated to conduct or to ensure that health care services,
information, and counseling at the limited-services pregnancy services center
are conducted in accordance with State law and professional standards of
practice may constitute unprofessional conduct under 3 V.S.A. § 129a and 26
V.S.A. § 1354. [Repealed.]

civil investigations, and bring civil actions with respect to violations of

undertaken one or more acts or omissions while in another U.S. jurisdiction to
aid or encourage, or attempt to aid or encourage, any person in the exercise
and enjoyment, or attempted exercise and enjoyment, of rights to reproductive
health care services or gender-affirming health care services that would have

Sec. 4. 9 V.S.A. chapter 63, subchapter 11 is amended to read:

Subchapter 11. Pregnancy Services Centers Health Care Services
§ 2491. FINDINGS; LEGISLATIVE INTENT
(a) Findings. The General Assembly finds that:
(1) Centers that seek to counsel clients against abortion, often referred
to as crisis pregnancy centers or limited-services pregnancy centers, have
become common across the country, including in Vermont. Accurate
information about the services that a limited-services pregnancy center
performs, in addition to forthright acknowledgement of its limitations, is
essential to enable individuals in this State to make informed decisions about
their care. This includes individuals being informed of whether they are
receiving services from a licensed and qualified health care provider at a
limited-services pregnancy center, as this allows individuals to determine if
they need to seek medical care elsewhere in order to continue or terminate a
pregnancy.
(2) Although some limited-services pregnancy centers openly
acknowledge in their advertising, on their websites, and at their facilities that
they neither provide abortions nor refer clients to other providers of abortion
services, others provide confusing and misleading information to pregnant
individuals contemplating abortion by leading those individuals to believe that
their facilities offer abortion services and unbiased counseling. Some limited-
services pregnancy centers have promoted patently false or biased medical
claims about abortion, pregnancy, contraception, and reproductive health care
providers.
(3) False and misleading advertising by centers that do not offer or refer
clients for abortion is of special concern to the State because of the time-
sensitive and constitutionally protected nature of the decision to continue or
terminate a pregnancy. When a pregnant individual is misled into believing
that a center offers services that it does not in fact offer or receives false or
misleading information regarding health care options, the individual loses time
crucial to the decision whether to terminate a pregnancy and may lose the
option to choose a particular method or to terminate a pregnancy at all.
(4) Telling the truth is how trained health care providers demonstrate
respect for patients, foster trust, promote self-determination, and cultivate an
environment where best practices in shared decision-making can flourish.
Without veracity in information and communication, it is difficult for
individuals to make informed, voluntary choices that are essential to one’s
sense of personal agency and autonomy.
(5)(2) Advertising strategies and educational information about health
care options that lack transparency, use misleading or ambiguous terminology,
misrepresent or obfuscate services provided, or provide factually inaccurate

information are a form of manipulation that disrespects individuals,
undermines trust, broadens health disparity, and can result in patient harm.
(b) Intent.
(1) It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that the public is
provided with accurate, factual information about the types of health care
services that are available to pregnant individuals in this State. The General
Assembly respects the constitutionally protected right of each individual to
personal reproductive autonomy, which includes the right to receive clear,
honest, and nonmisleading information about the individual’s options and to
make informed, voluntary choices after considering all relevant information.
(2) The General Assembly respects the right of limited-services
pregnancy centers to counsel individuals against abortion, and nothing in this
subchapter should be construed to regulate, limit, or curtail such advocacy.
§ 2492. DEFINITIONS DEFINITION
As used in this subchapter:,
(1) “Abortion” means any medical treatment intended to induce the
termination of, or to terminate, a clinically diagnosable pregnancy except for
the purpose of producing a live birth.
(2) “Client” means an individual who is inquiring about or seeking
services at a pregnancy services center.
(3) “Emergency contraception” means any drug approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration as a contraceptive method for use after sexual
intercourse, whether provided over the counter or by prescription.
(4) “Health information” means any oral or written information in any
form or medium that relates to health insurance or the past, present, or future
physical or mental health or condition of a client.
(5) “Limited-services pregnancy center” means a pregnancy services
center that does not directly provide, or provide referrals to clients for,
abortions or emergency contraception.
(6) “Pregnancy services center” means a facility, including a mobile
facility, where the primary purpose is to provide services to individuals who
are or may be pregnant and that either offers obstetric ultrasounds, obstetric
sonograms, or prenatal care to pregnant individuals or has the appearance of a
medical facility. A pregnancy services center has the appearance of a medical
facility if two or more of the following factors are present:
(A) The center offers pregnancy testing or pregnancy diagnosis, or
both.

(B) The center has staff or volunteers who wear medical attire or
uniforms.
(C) The center contains one or more examination tables.
(D) The center contains a private or semiprivate room or area
containing medical supplies or medical instruments.
(E) The center has staff or volunteers who collect health information
from clients.
(F) The center is located on the same premises as a State-licensed
medical facility or provider or shares facility space with a State-licensed
medical provider.
(7) “Premises” means land and improvements or appurtenances or any
part thereof “health care services” means all supplies, care, and services of a
medical, dental, behavioral health, mental health, substance use disorder
treatment, surgical, psychiatric, therapeutic, diagnostic, preventative,
rehabilitative, or supportive nature, including medication.
§ 2493. UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE ACT
(a) It is an unfair and deceptive act and practice in commerce and a
violation of section 2453 of this title for any limited-services pregnancy center
person to disseminate or cause to be disseminated to the public any advertising
about the health care services or proposed services performed at that center in
this State that is untrue or clearly designed to mislead the public about the
nature of the services provided. Advertising includes representations made
directly to consumers; marketing practices; communication in any print
medium, such as newspapers, magazines, mailers, or handouts; and any
broadcast medium, such as television or radio, telephone marketing, or
advertising over the Internet internet such as through websites and, web ads
advertisements, and social media. For purposes of this chapter, advertising or
the provision of services by a limited-services pregnancy center about health
care services is an act in commerce.
(b) Health care providers certified, registered, or licensed under Title 26 of
the Vermont Statutes Annotated who are employed by, contracted to provide
services for or on behalf of, or volunteer to provide services at a limited-
services pregnancy center shall be responsible for conducting and providing
health care services, information, and counseling at the center. The failure of a
health care professional certified, registered, or licensed under Title 26 of the
Vermont Statutes Annotated to conduct or to ensure that health care services,
information, and counseling at the limited-services pregnancy services center
are conducted in accordance with State law and professional standards of
practice may constitute unprofessional conduct under 3 V.S.A. § 129a and 26
V.S.A. § 1354. [Repealed.]

(c) The Attorney General has the same authority to make rules, conduct
civil investigations, and bring civil actions with respect to violations of
subsection (a) of this section as provided under subchapter 1 of this chapter.
Sec. 5. 12 V.S.A. § 7306 is amended to read:
§ 7306. NONCOOPERATION
(a) No public agency or employee, appointee, officer or official, or any
other person individual acting on behalf of a public agency may knowingly
provide any information or expend or use time, money, facilities, property,
equipment, personnel, or other resources in furtherance of any interstate or
federal investigation or proceeding seeking to impose civil or criminal liability
upon a person an individual or entity for:
(1) the provision, seeking or receipt of, or inquiring about legally
protected health care activity that is legal in this State; or
(2) assisting any person individual or entity providing, seeking,
receiving, or responding to an inquiry about legally protected health care
activity that is legal in this State.
(b) This section shall not apply to:
(1) any investigation or proceeding where the conduct subject to
potential liability under the investigation or proceeding would be subject to
liability under the laws of this State if committed in this State;
(2) any action taken by the Judicial Branch in judicial proceedings order
issued by a Vermont State court or a federal court; or
(3) a public agency or employee, appointee, officer or official, or any
other individual acting on behalf of a public agency who, in the course of
normal business, is responding to a warrant or extradition demand on the good
faith belief that the warrant or demand is valid in this State.
Sec. 6. 18 V.S.A. § 1881 is amended to read:

reidentification and is related to a legally protected health care activity:
(A) to any government entity other than the State of Vermont or its
political subdivisions or instrumentalities if the covered entity or business

committed within or outside the State, constitutes unprofessional conduct:
* * *
(2) all advertising of about health care services or a medical business

upon credulous or ignorant persons and so be harmful or injurious to public
morals or safety;
* * *
(21) permitting one’s name or license to be used by a person, group, or
corporation when not actually in charge of, or responsible for, or actively
overseeing the treatment given or other health care services provided;
* * *

medication is in fact the patient, and is in fact who the person claims to be;
(ii) establishment of documented diagnosis through the use of

prior to the patient’s first appointment; or
(v)(vi) emergency situations where life or health of the patient is
