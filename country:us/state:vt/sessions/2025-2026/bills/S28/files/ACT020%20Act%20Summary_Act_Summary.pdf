Act No. 20 (S.28). An act relating to access to certain legally protected health care services
Subjects: Health; health care professionals; legally protected health care activity;
Consumer Protection Act; limited-services pregnancy centers; unprofessional
conduct; medication abortions; fetal death reports
This act creates reciprocity with other states that also safeguard access to reproductive
health care and gender-affirming health care services, which Vermont law refers to as
“legally protected health care activity.” It establishes a new exemption from the Public
Records Act for records held by a State professional licensing entity if the records contain
the telephone number, email address, or physical or mailing address of an applicant or
licensee, other than an address that the applicant or licensee has designated as a public
address. The act amends laws describing unprofessional conduct for professions
regulated by the Office of Professional Regulation and the Board of Medical Practice to
include advertising that is intended or has a tendency to mislead as well as to deceive and
permitting one’s name or license to be used when not actively overseeing the services
provided, in addition to when not actually in charge of or responsible for those services.
The act also creates an exception to the prohibition on using a questionnaire for the initial
evaluation of a patient to allow prescribing medication to a patient to terminate
pregnancy based on an adaptive questionnaire that allows the provider to get additional
medical history and ask follow-up questions as needed.
The act expands the scope of health-related conduct that violates the Consumer
Protection Act from advertising of services by limited-services pregnancy centers to
untrue or misleading advertising by any person regarding health care services performed
in this State. It adds federal investigations and proceedings to an existing prohibition on
public agencies and officials cooperating in an interstate investigation or proceeding that
seeks to impose civil or criminal liability on anyone who has engaged in legally protected
health care activity in Vermont, with a corresponding exemption for compliance with
federal court orders in addition to Vermont court orders. The act modifies limitations on
disclosure of protected health information related to a legally protected health care
activity and requires that reports of fetal deaths, which are already excluded from the
Public Records Act, be kept confidential, prevents them from being discoverable in legal
proceedings, and reduces the time after which the records must be destroyed from five
years to two years. The act also allows prescribers and pharmacists to request their
names be removed from fulfilled prescriptions for medications for gender-affirming or
reproductive health care services and provides immunity for licensed members of a
pharmacy’s staff who fail to remove a prescriber’s or pharmacist’s name as long as the
staff member’s acts or omissions did not constitute gross negligence, recklessness, or
intentional misconduct.
