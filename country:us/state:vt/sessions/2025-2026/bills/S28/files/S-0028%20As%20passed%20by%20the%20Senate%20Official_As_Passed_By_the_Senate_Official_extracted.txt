1 S.28
2 Introduced by Senators Hardy, Lyons, Clarkson, Gulick, Vyhovsky and White
3 Referred to Committee on Health and Welfare
4 Date: January 29, 2025
5 Subject: Health; health care professionals; legally protected health care;
6 limited-services pregnancy centers; Consumer Protection Act;
7 unprofessional conduct; medication abortions; fetal death reports
8 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to expand the
9 prohibition on untrue or misleading advertising by a limited-services
10 pregnancy center under the Consumer Protection Act to apply to any untrue or
11 misleading advertising about health care services. It would eliminate specific
12 responsibility for licensed health care providers who provide services at a
13 limited-services pregnancy center for the services provided at the center and
14 would remove language indicating that failure to ensure those services are
15 conducted in accordance with the law could constitute unprofessional conduct.
16 The bill would also clarify and expand the types of actions that could be
17 considered unprofessional conduct for physicians, physician assistants,
18 advanced practice registered nurses, and naturopathic physicians under their
19 licensure statutes. The bill would eliminate restrictions on a physician,
20 physician assistant, or advanced practice registered nurse prescribing
21 medication to terminate an individual’s pregnancy based on asynchronous
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.28

1 electronic or other online communication with the individual. It would also
2 specify that fetal death reports required by law must be kept confidential.
3 An act relating to access to certain legally protected health care services
4 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
5 Sec. 1. 9 V.S.A. chapter 63, subchapter 11 is amended to read:
6 Subchapter 11. Pregnancy Services Centers Health Care Services
7 § 2491. FINDINGS; LEGISLATIVE INTENT
8 (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds that:
9 (1) Centers that seek to counsel clients against abortion, often referred
10 to as crisis pregnancy centers or limited-services pregnancy centers, have
11 become common across the country, including in Vermont. Accurate
12 information about the services that a limited-services pregnancy center
13 performs, in addition to forthright acknowledgement of its limitations, is
14 essential to enable individuals in this State to make informed decisions about
15 their care. This includes individuals being informed of whether they are
16 receiving services from a licensed and qualified health care provider at a
17 limited-services pregnancy center, as this allows individuals to determine if
18 they need to seek medical care elsewhere in order to continue or terminate a
19 pregnancy.
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.28

1 (2) Although some limited-services pregnancy centers openly
2 acknowledge in their advertising, on their websites, and at their facilities that
3 they neither provide abortions nor refer clients to other providers of abortion
4 services, others provide confusing and misleading information to pregnant
5 individuals contemplating abortion by leading those individuals to believe that
6 their facilities offer abortion services and unbiased counseling. Some limited-
7 services pregnancy centers have promoted patently false or biased medical
8 claims about abortion, pregnancy, contraception, and reproductive health care
9 providers.
10 (3) False and misleading advertising by centers that do not offer or refer
11 clients for abortion is of special concern to the State because of the time-
12 sensitive and constitutionally protected nature of the decision to continue or
13 terminate a pregnancy. When a pregnant individual is misled into believing
14 that a center offers services that it does not in fact offer or receives false or
15 misleading information regarding health care options, the individual loses time
16 crucial to the decision whether to terminate a pregnancy and may lose the
17 option to choose a particular method or to terminate a pregnancy at all.
18 (4) Telling the truth is how trained health care providers demonstrate
19 respect for patients, foster trust, promote self-determination, and cultivate an
20 environment where best practices in shared decision-making can flourish.
21 Without veracity in information and communication, it is difficult for
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.28
2025 Page 4 of 34
1 individuals to make informed, voluntary choices that are essential to one’s
2 sense of personal agency and autonomy.
3 (5)(2) Advertising strategies and educational information about health
4 care options that lack transparency, use misleading or ambiguous terminology,
5 misrepresent or obfuscate services provided, or provide factually inaccurate
6 information are a form of manipulation that disrespects individuals,
7 undermines trust, broadens health disparity, and can result in patient harm.
8 (b) Intent.
9 (1) It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that the public is
10 provided with accurate, factual information about the types of health care
11 services that are available to pregnant individuals in this State. The General
12 Assembly respects the constitutionally protected right of each individual to
13 personal reproductive autonomy, which includes the right to receive clear,
14 honest, and nonmisleading information about the individual’s options and to
15 make informed, voluntary choices after considering all relevant information.
16 (2) The General Assembly respects the right of limited-services
17 pregnancy centers to counsel individuals against abortion, and nothing in this
18 subchapter should be construed to regulate, limit, or curtail such advocacy.

Subchapter 11. Pregnancy Services Centers Health Care Services

Section 3:
§ 2491. FINDINGS; LEGISLATIVE INTENT
(a) Findings. The General Assembly finds that:
(1) Centers that seek to counsel clients against abortion, often referred
to as crisis pregnancy centers or limited-services pregnancy centers, have
become common across the country, including in Vermont. Accurate
information about the services that a limited-services pregnancy center
performs, in addition to forthright acknowledgement of its limitations, is
essential to enable individuals in this State to make informed decisions about
their care. This includes individuals being informed of whether they are
receiving services from a licensed and qualified health care provider at a
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.28
2025 Page 25 of 34
limited-services pregnancy center, as this allows individuals to determine if
they need to seek medical care elsewhere in order to continue or terminate a
pregnancy.
(2) Although some limited-services pregnancy centers openly
acknowledge in their advertising, on their websites, and at their facilities that
they neither provide abortions nor refer clients to other providers of abortion
services, others provide confusing and misleading information to pregnant
individuals contemplating abortion by leading those individuals to believe that
their facilities offer abortion services and unbiased counseling. Some limited-
services pregnancy centers have promoted patently false or biased medical
claims about abortion, pregnancy, contraception, and reproductive health care
providers.
(3) False and misleading advertising by centers that do not offer or
refer clients for abortion is of special concern to the State because of the time-
sensitive and constitutionally protected nature of the decision to continue or
terminate a pregnancy. When a pregnant individual is misled into believing
that a center offers services that it does not in fact offer or receives false or
misleading information regarding health care options, the individual loses time
crucial to the decision whether to terminate a pregnancy and may lose the
option to choose a particular method or to terminate a pregnancy at all.
(4) Telling the truth is how trained health care providers demonstrate
respect for patients, foster trust, promote self-determination, and cultivate an
environment where best practices in shared decision-making can flourish.
Without veracity in information and communication, it is difficult for
individuals to make informed, voluntary choices that are essential to one’s
sense of personal agency and autonomy.
(5)(2) Advertising strategies and educational information about health
care options that lack transparency, use misleading or ambiguous terminology,
misrepresent or obfuscate services provided, or provide factually inaccurate
information are a form of manipulation that disrespects individuals,
undermines trust, broadens health disparity, and can result in patient harm.
(b) Intent.
(1) It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that the public is
provided with accurate, factual information about the types of health care
services that are available to pregnant individuals in this State. The General
Assembly respects the constitutionally protected right of each individual to
personal reproductive autonomy, which includes the right to receive clear,
honest, and nonmisleading information about the individual’s options and to
make informed, voluntary choices after considering all relevant information.
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.28
2025 Page 26 of 34
(2) The General Assembly respects the right of limited-services
pregnancy centers to counsel individuals against abortion, and nothing in this
subchapter should be construed to regulate, limit, or curtail such advocacy.

Section 4:
§ 2492. DEFINITIONS DEFINITION

person to disseminate or cause to be disseminated to the public any advertising
about the health care services or proposed services performed at that center in
this State that is untrue or clearly designed to mislead the public about the

medium, such as newspapers, magazines, mailers, or handouts; and any
broadcast medium, such as television or radio, telephone marketing, or
advertising over the Internet internet such as through websites and, web ads

(c) The Attorney General has the same authority to make rules, conduct
civil investigations, and bring civil actions with respect to violations of
subsection (a) of this section as provided under subchapter 1 of this chapter.

Raw Text:
BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.28
2025 Page 1 of 34
1 S.28
2 Introduced by Senators Hardy, Lyons, Clarkson, Gulick, Vyhovsky and White
3 Referred to Committee on Health and Welfare
4 Date: January 29, 2025
5 Subject: Health; health care professionals; legally protected health care;
6 limited-services pregnancy centers; Consumer Protection Act;
7 unprofessional conduct; medication abortions; fetal death reports
8 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to expand the
9 prohibition on untrue or misleading advertising by a limited-services
10 pregnancy center under the Consumer Protection Act to apply to any untrue or
11 misleading advertising about health care services. It would eliminate specific
12 responsibility for licensed health care providers who provide services at a
13 limited-services pregnancy center for the services provided at the center and
14 would remove language indicating that failure to ensure those services are
15 conducted in accordance with the law could constitute unprofessional conduct.
16 The bill would also clarify and expand the types of actions that could be
17 considered unprofessional conduct for physicians, physician assistants,
18 advanced practice registered nurses, and naturopathic physicians under their
19 licensure statutes. The bill would eliminate restrictions on a physician,
20 physician assistant, or advanced practice registered nurse prescribing
21 medication to terminate an individual’s pregnancy based on asynchronous

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.28

1 electronic or other online communication with the individual. It would also
2 specify that fetal death reports required by law must be kept confidential.
3 An act relating to access to certain legally protected health care services
4 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
5 Sec. 1. 9 V.S.A. chapter 63, subchapter 11 is amended to read:
6 Subchapter 11. Pregnancy Services Centers Health Care Services
7 § 2491. FINDINGS; LEGISLATIVE INTENT
8 (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds that:
9 (1) Centers that seek to counsel clients against abortion, often referred
10 to as crisis pregnancy centers or limited-services pregnancy centers, have
11 become common across the country, including in Vermont. Accurate
12 information about the services that a limited-services pregnancy center
13 performs, in addition to forthright acknowledgement of its limitations, is
14 essential to enable individuals in this State to make informed decisions about
15 their care. This includes individuals being informed of whether they are
16 receiving services from a licensed and qualified health care provider at a
17 limited-services pregnancy center, as this allows individuals to determine if
18 they need to seek medical care elsewhere in order to continue or terminate a
19 pregnancy.

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.28
2025 Page 3 of 34
1 (2) Although some limited-services pregnancy centers openly
2 acknowledge in their advertising, on their websites, and at their facilities that
3 they neither provide abortions nor refer clients to other providers of abortion
4 services, others provide confusing and misleading information to pregnant
5 individuals contemplating abortion by leading those individuals to believe that
6 their facilities offer abortion services and unbiased counseling. Some limited-
7 services pregnancy centers have promoted patently false or biased medical
8 claims about abortion, pregnancy, contraception, and reproductive health care
9 providers.
10 (3) False and misleading advertising by centers that do not offer or refer
11 clients for abortion is of special concern to the State because of the time-
12 sensitive and constitutionally protected nature of the decision to continue or
13 terminate a pregnancy. When a pregnant individual is misled into believing
14 that a center offers services that it does not in fact offer or receives false or
15 misleading information regarding health care options, the individual loses time
16 crucial to the decision whether to terminate a pregnancy and may lose the
17 option to choose a particular method or to terminate a pregnancy at all.
18 (4) Telling the truth is how trained health care providers demonstrate
19 respect for patients, foster trust, promote self-determination, and cultivate an
20 environment where best practices in shared decision-making can flourish.
21 Without veracity in information and communication, it is difficult for

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.28
2025 Page 4 of 34
1 individuals to make informed, voluntary choices that are essential to one’s
2 sense of personal agency and autonomy.
3 (5)(2) Advertising strategies and educational information about health
4 care options that lack transparency, use misleading or ambiguous terminology,
5 misrepresent or obfuscate services provided, or provide factually inaccurate
6 information are a form of manipulation that disrespects individuals,
7 undermines trust, broadens health disparity, and can result in patient harm.
8 (b) Intent.
9 (1) It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that the public is
10 provided with accurate, factual information about the types of health care
11 services that are available to pregnant individuals in this State. The General
12 Assembly respects the constitutionally protected right of each individual to
13 personal reproductive autonomy, which includes the right to receive clear,
14 honest, and nonmisleading information about the individual’s options and to
15 make informed, voluntary choices after considering all relevant information.
16 (2) The General Assembly respects the right of limited-services
17 pregnancy centers to counsel individuals against abortion, and nothing in this
18 subchapter should be construed to regulate, limit, or curtail such advocacy.

Sec. 3. 9 V.S.A. chapter 63, subchapter 11 is amended to read:
Subchapter 11. Pregnancy Services Centers Health Care Services
§ 2491. FINDINGS; LEGISLATIVE INTENT
(a) Findings. The General Assembly finds that:
(1) Centers that seek to counsel clients against abortion, often referred
to as crisis pregnancy centers or limited-services pregnancy centers, have
become common across the country, including in Vermont. Accurate
information about the services that a limited-services pregnancy center
performs, in addition to forthright acknowledgement of its limitations, is
essential to enable individuals in this State to make informed decisions about
their care. This includes individuals being informed of whether they are
receiving services from a licensed and qualified health care provider at a

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.28
2025 Page 25 of 34
limited-services pregnancy center, as this allows individuals to determine if
they need to seek medical care elsewhere in order to continue or terminate a
pregnancy.
(2) Although some limited-services pregnancy centers openly
acknowledge in their advertising, on their websites, and at their facilities that
they neither provide abortions nor refer clients to other providers of abortion
services, others provide confusing and misleading information to pregnant
individuals contemplating abortion by leading those individuals to believe that
their facilities offer abortion services and unbiased counseling. Some limited-
services pregnancy centers have promoted patently false or biased medical
claims about abortion, pregnancy, contraception, and reproductive health care
providers.
(3) False and misleading advertising by centers that do not offer or
refer clients for abortion is of special concern to the State because of the time-
sensitive and constitutionally protected nature of the decision to continue or
terminate a pregnancy. When a pregnant individual is misled into believing
that a center offers services that it does not in fact offer or receives false or
misleading information regarding health care options, the individual loses time
crucial to the decision whether to terminate a pregnancy and may lose the
option to choose a particular method or to terminate a pregnancy at all.
(4) Telling the truth is how trained health care providers demonstrate
respect for patients, foster trust, promote self-determination, and cultivate an
environment where best practices in shared decision-making can flourish.
Without veracity in information and communication, it is difficult for
individuals to make informed, voluntary choices that are essential to one’s
sense of personal agency and autonomy.
(5)(2) Advertising strategies and educational information about health
care options that lack transparency, use misleading or ambiguous terminology,
misrepresent or obfuscate services provided, or provide factually inaccurate
information are a form of manipulation that disrespects individuals,
undermines trust, broadens health disparity, and can result in patient harm.
(b) Intent.
(1) It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that the public is
provided with accurate, factual information about the types of health care
services that are available to pregnant individuals in this State. The General
Assembly respects the constitutionally protected right of each individual to
personal reproductive autonomy, which includes the right to receive clear,
honest, and nonmisleading information about the individual’s options and to
make informed, voluntary choices after considering all relevant information.

BILLAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED BY SENATE S.28
2025 Page 26 of 34
(2) The General Assembly respects the right of limited-services
pregnancy centers to counsel individuals against abortion, and nothing in this
subchapter should be construed to regulate, limit, or curtail such advocacy.
§ 2492. DEFINITIONS DEFINITION
