3 Referred to Committee on
4 Date:
5 Subject: Corrections; release prior to trial; supervision of adult inmates and
6 offenders; classification of inmates and offenders; release after
7 incarceration; reentry facility
8 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to create a
9 statutory framework for the Department of Corrections to establish and use
10 reentry facilities designed to house persons with low-level risk and needs
11 assessments upon release from incarceration. The bill proposes that the
12 Department of Corrections assess and place appropriate persons in a reentry
13 facility to provide the least restrictive security level necessary to protect the
14 public while providing any transitional services needed by the person. The bill
15 also proposes that reentry facility placement be condition of release available
16 to the courts. The bill also proposes that the Department of Corrections submit
17 annual reports on the use of reentry facilities and a plan to develop any reentry
18 facilities.
19 An act relating to establishing reentry facilities for persons under the
20 custody of the Commissioner of Corrections

1 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
2 Sec. 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE
3 (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds that:
4 (1) Housing insecurity disproportionately impacts women in the
5 criminal justice system, resulting in inequitable detention outcomes.
6 (2) Women nearing the end of their criminal sentences or detained
7 pretrial lack consistent access to appropriate low-security settings, impeding
8 successful reentry and exacerbating equity concerns.
9 (3) Current practices, such as reward-based housing classifications,
10 create barriers to equitable access to low-security or reentry-focused facilities.
11 (4) The Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility was not designed to
12 meet the diverse security and reentry needs of incarcerated women.
13 (b) Purpose. The purpose of this act is to:
14 (1) ensure all incarcerated women are housed at the least restrictive
15 security level appropriate to their risk and needs;
16 (2) establish a statutory framework for reentry-specific facilities that
17 prioritize rehabilitation, equity, and community reintegration;
18 (3) address inequities in pretrial detention related to housing insecurity;
19 and
20 (4) minimize barriers to reentry by reforming incarceration classification
21 and housing policies.

VT LEG #380894 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.436

1 sentencing or commitment, excluding weekends and holidays, classify the
2 person to determine whether he or she the person shall be incarcerated, held at
3 a community work camp, placed in a reentry facility, or furloughed. Failure to
4 classify within the five-day period shall not create a private right of action
5 against the State, its political subdivisions, or its employees.
6 (b) Notwithstanding 13 V.S.A. § 7554, the Commissioner may place on
7 furlough under provisions of section 808 of this title or in a reentry facility
8 pursuant to section 602 of this title, a misdemeanor defendant when the
9 Commissioner, based upon a completed classification, has determined that the
10 defendant is likely to appear in court as directed. If the Commissioner places
11 such a defendant on furlough or in a reentry facility, the Commissioner shall
12 impose not only the conditions of release initially ordered by the judicial
13 officer, but also such additional terms or conditions deemed necessary to
14 ensure that the defendant will appear in court. The Commissioner shall
15 supervise compliance with all such conditions imposed.

17 § 808. TEMPORARY FURLOUGHS GRANTED TO OFFENDERS
18 (a) The Department may extend the limits of the place of confinement of an
19 offender at any correctional facility or reentry facility if the offender agrees to
20 comply with such conditions of supervision the Department, in its sole
21 discretion, deems appropriate for that offender’s furlough. The Department
VT LEG #380894 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.436
2025 Page 7 of 12
1 may authorize a temporary furlough for a defined period for any of the
2 following reasons:
3 (1) to visit a critically ill relative;
4 (2) to attend the funeral of a relative;
5 (3) to obtain medical services;
6 (4) to contact prospective employers; or
7 (5) to secure a suitable residence for use upon discharge.
8 (b) An offender granted a temporary furlough pursuant to this section may
9 be accompanied by an employee of the Department, in the discretion of the
10 Commissioner, during the period of the offender’s furlough. The Department
11 may use electronic monitoring equipment such as global position monitoring,
12 automated voice recognition telephone equipment, and transdermal alcohol
13 monitoring equipment to enable more effective or efficient supervision of
14 individuals placed on furlough.
15 (c) The extension of the limits of the place of confinement authorized by
16 this section shall in no way be interpreted as a probation or parole of the
17 offender, but shall constitute solely a permitted extension of the limits of the
18 place of confinement for offenders committed to the custody of the
19 Commissioner.
20 (d) When any enforcement officer, as defined in 23 V.S.A. § 4; employee
21 of the Department; or correctional officer responsible for supervising an
VT LEG #380894 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.436
2025 Page 8 of 12
1 offender believes the offender is in violation of any verbal or written condition
2 of the temporary furlough, the officer or employee may immediately lodge the
3 offender at a correctional or reentry facility or orally or in writing deputize any
4 law enforcement officer or agency to arrest and lodge the offender at such a
5 correctional or reentry facility. The officer or employee shall subsequently
6 document the reason for taking such action.
7 (e) The Commissioner may place on medical furlough any offender who is
8 serving a sentence, including an offender who has not yet served the minimum
9 term of the sentence, who is diagnosed with a terminal or serious medical
10 condition so as to render the offender unlikely to be physically capable of
11 presenting a danger to society. The Commissioner shall develop a policy
12 regarding the application for, standards for eligibility of, and supervision of
13 persons on medical furlough. The offender may be released to a reentry
14 facility, hospital, hospice, other licensed inpatient facility, or other housing
15 accommodation deemed suitable by the Commissioner. As used in this
16 subsection, a “serious medical condition” does not mean a condition caused by
17 noncompliance with a medical treatment plan.
18 (f) [Repealed.]
19 (g) Subsection (b) of this section shall also apply to sections section 808a
20 and 808c of this title.

1 Sec. 6. 28 V.S.A. § 808a is amended to read:
2 § 808a. TREATMENT FURLOUGH
3 (a) An offender may be sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment, but
4 placed by a court on treatment furlough to participate in such programs
5 administered by the Department at a reentry facility or in the community that
6 reduce the offender’s risk to reoffend or that provide reparation to the
7 community in the form of supervised work activities.
8 (b) Provided the approval of the sentencing judge, if available, otherwise a
9 Superior Court judge, is first obtained, the Department may place on treatment
10 furlough an offender who has not yet served the minimum term of the
11 sentence, who, in the Department’s determination, needs residential treatment
12 services not available in a correctional facility. The services may include
13 treatment for substance abuse or personal violence or any other condition that
14 the Department has determined should be addressed in order to reduce the
15 offender’s risk to reoffend or cause harm to himself or herself themselves or to
16 others in the facility. The offender shall be released only to a reentry facility
17 established pursuant to section 602 of this title or a hospital or residential
18 treatment facility that provides services to the general population. The State’s
19 share of the cost of placement in such a facility, net of any private or federal
20 participation, shall be paid pursuant to memoranda of agreement between and
21 within State agencies reflective of their shared responsibilities to maximize the
VT LEG #380894 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.436
2025 Page 10 of 12
1 efficient and effective use of State resources. In the event that a memorandum
2 of agreement cannot be reached, the Secretary of Administration shall make a
3 final determination as to the manner in which costs will be allocated.
4 (c) [Repealed.]
5 Sec. 7. 13 V.S.A. § 7554 is amended to read:
6 § 7554. RELEASE PRIOR TO TRIAL
7 (a) Release; conditions of release. Any person charged with an offense,
8 other than a person held without bail under section 7553 or 7553a of this title,
9 shall at the person’s appearance before a judicial officer be ordered released
10 pending trial in accordance with this section.
11 (1) The defendant shall be ordered released on personal recognizance or
12 upon the execution of an unsecured appearance bond in an amount specified by
13 the judicial officer unless the judicial officer determines that such a release will
14 not reasonably mitigate the risk of flight from prosecution as required. In
15 determining whether the defendant presents a risk of flight from prosecution,
16 the judicial officer shall consider, in addition to any other factors, the
17 seriousness of the offense charged; the number of offenses with which the
18 person is charged; whether, at the time of the current offense or arrest, the
19 defendant was released on conditions or personal recognizance, on probation,
20 furlough, parole, or other release pending trial, sentencing, appeal, or
21 completion of a sentence for an offense under federal or state law; and
VT LEG #380894 v.1

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.436
2025 Page 11 of 12
1 whether, in connection with a criminal prosecution, the defendant is compliant
2 with court orders or has failed to appear at a court hearing. If the judicial
3 officer determines that the defendant presents a risk of flight from prosecution,
4 the officer shall, either in lieu of or in addition to the methods of release in this
5 section, impose the least restrictive of the following conditions or the least
6 restrictive combination of the following conditions that will reasonably
7 mitigate the risk of flight of the defendant as required:
8 * * *
9 (I) Place the defendant in the home detention program pursuant to
10 section 7554b of this title.
11 (J) Place the defendant in a reentry facility pursuant to 28 V.S.A.
12 § 602.
13 (2) If the judicial officer determines that conditions of release imposed
14 to mitigate the risk of flight will not reasonably protect the public, the judicial
15 officer may impose, in addition, the least restrictive of the following conditions
16 or the least restrictive combination of the following conditions that will
17 reasonably ensure protection of the public:
18 * * *
19 (H) Place the defendant in the home detention program pursuant to
20 section 7554b of this title.
