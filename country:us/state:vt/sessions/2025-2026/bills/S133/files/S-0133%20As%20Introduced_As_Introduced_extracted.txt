13 shall publish on its website and submit to the House Committee on
14 Environment and to the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy

16 in the Vermont Wetland Rules subsections 9.5(b) and (c). The guidance shall
17 clearly identify the process applicants should follow and the information and
