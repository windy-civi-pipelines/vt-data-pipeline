3 Referred to Committee on
4 Date:
5 Subject: General provisions; common law; general rights; Open Meeting Law;
6 right to attend meetings of public agencies; disruption of meetings
7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to expressly
8 authorize the chairs of public bodies to adopt rules governing public comment
9 and the disruption of a meeting by a member of the public. This bill also

14 effective conduct of a meeting as a basis for a disorderly conduct violation.

1 assemble, and the necessity for the effective and efficient conduct of
2 governmental business. Members of the public should be able to attend
3 meetings and engage in the free interchange of ideas, but should not be
4 permitted to obstruct the continuation of a meeting without regard to the
5 explicit rules governing the meeting’s conduct. The obstructive conduct of one
6 member of the public should not be permitted to eliminate the interests of other
7 members of the public to peacefully assemble at an open meeting. Public
8 bodies should understand that an adverse audience is part of the democratic
9 process and should not attempt to enforce arbitrary rules of order or attempt to
10 remove members of the public who do not cause the substantial disruption of a
11 meeting. Accordingly, it is the intent of the General Assembly that all public
12 bodies have the authority to adopt appropriate rules governing the conduct and
13 participation of the public at a meeting subject to Vermont’s Open Meeting
14 Law. Further, it is the intent of the General Assembly that an individual’s
15 actions be subject to Vermont’s disorderly conduct statute when the actions
16 interfere with a meeting of a public body so that the meeting prematurely
17 terminates or consist of numerous and sustained efforts to disrupt the meeting
18 after the public body has requested that the individual desist.
19 Sec. 2. 1 V.S.A. § 312 is amended to read:
20 § 312. RIGHT TO ATTEND MEETINGS OF PUBLIC AGENCIES
