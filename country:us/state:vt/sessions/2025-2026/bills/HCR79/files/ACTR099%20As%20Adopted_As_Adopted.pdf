Whereas, in 1993, Matthew Perry and Patricia Pedreira established the Vermont Arts
Exchange (VAE) that was originally located in the old mill at the end of Sage Street in
North Bennington, and in 1994, VAE was officially established as a 501c(3) nonprofit
arts and community development organization, and
Whereas, VAE conducts studio-based programs in arts media such as “papermaking,
printmaking, ceramics, sculpture, drawing, painting, writing, music and dance,” and it has
a “focus on working in the environment, using the outdoors as …[its]…studio,” and
Whereas, in 1997, VAE cleared a waterway, Paran Creek, and made artwork from the
junk collected; in 1998, it created the Vermont Arts Housing and Preservation
Partnership Project, a coordinated project with Housing Vermont that created 15 local
affordable housing units for families with low and moderate income and studio space for
artists; in 2003, the Preservation Trust of Vermont presented VAE with the Trust’s
Biennial Preservation Award; and in 2004, the organization inaugurated the cabaret style
Basement Music Series, and
Whereas, the Art Bus brings VAE’s “Mission in Motion” traveling art studio to
individuals in many locations, and
Whereas, in 2010, Matthew Perry assumed the executive directorship of VAE, and in
2015, VAE moved to a more visible location at 48 Main Street, prompting the creation of
a “campus model” of arts programming, and
Whereas, although primarily supporting arts programs in Bennington County, VAE’s
creative presence extends across the nation and internationally, and
Whereas, on Saturday, April 5, 2025, the artistic achievements and initiatives of VAE
will be recognized with events at the Bennington Museum as part of a month-long exhibit
“From the Studio to the Streets: Vermont Arts Exchange, 30 Years of Community
Engagement through the Arts,” a celebration of VAE’s artistic achievements and
community impact, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly celebrates the 30th anniversary of the Vermont Arts
Exchange and its collaborative artistic endeavors, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
VAE and the Bennington Museum.
