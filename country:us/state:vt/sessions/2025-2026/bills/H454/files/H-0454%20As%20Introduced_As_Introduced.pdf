8 of Education; State Board of Education
9 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to transform
10 Vermont’s education governance, quality, and finance systems. It would
11 create five school districts to govern the public education system for the entire
12 State, each governed by a school board and operated by a central office. This
13 bill also proposes to transform Vermont’s education financing system to a
14 foundation formula, with a base amount of $13,200.00 per student, in fiscal
15 year 2025, with additional weights based on student need, school scale, and
16 district sparsity, developed based on an evidence-based model that has been
17 adjusted to the Vermont context.
18 An act relating to transforming Vermont’s education governance, quality,
19 and finance systems

1 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
2 * * * Findings and Intent * * *
3 Sec. 1. FINDINGS; INTENT
4 The General Assembly finds that:
5 (1) The study commissioned in 2024 titled “An Evidence-Based
6 Approach to Identifying an Adequate Education Spending Level in Vermont”
7 by Allan Odden and Lawrence O. Picus evaluated Vermont education spending
8 against research-informed best practices. The evidence-based model is
9 designed to identify an array of staffing and resources that high-performing
10 schools need to provide every student with robust opportunities to meet college
11 and career-ready standards. Performing to those standards would substantially
12 improve student achievement and reduce demographic related performance
13 gaps.
14 (2) The evidence-based model represents an adequate model for the
15 level of education funding necessary to improve student achievement. It was
16 developed by experts in education funding with more than 25 years of
17 experience across the United States in determining how to adequately fund
18 schools, meaning providing a level of resources that would enable schools to
19 provide every student with an equal opportunity to learn to high performance
20 standards. The State has a Constitutional obligation to ensure that all students
21 are provided a quality education on a reasonably equal basis, without regard to
VT LEG #380731 v.5

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.454
2025 Page 3 of 194
1 town of residence. Doing so will require significant change to the current
2 system of education.
3 (3) Vermont’s current funding model equalizes school district’s ability
4 to raise education taxes, leveling out the distinctions in property wealth among
5 districts. The current funding system does not provide equalized education
6 dollars to districts. The choice to spend or not spend equitable amounts of
7 education funding per student across the State rests with individual districts.
8 Spending patterns demonstrate that many districts do not utilize the tax
9 equalization mechanisms to increase spending, even in the districts with the
10 most demonstrated student need.
11 (4) Vermont’s current school and school district sizes do not align with
12 the Evidence-Based Model, and contribute to higher costs that are not fully
13 addressed by the Model. In order to ensure the Model can be implemented in a
14 way that improves education quality, the State must be organized into larger
15 school districts that are responsible for approximately at minimum 3,900
16 students, a population that represents the minimum to achieve efficiency in
17 delivering the Evidence-Based Model.
18 (5) Additionally, larger school districts, consistent with State-level
19 guidance for school size, average class size, and budgetary priorities, must
20 examine the appropriate number of schools for the student population,
21 geography, student need, and community desires of the school district.
VT LEG #380731 v.5

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.454
2025 Page 4 of 194
1 (6) The intent of the proposed five districts is to charge school boards to
2 represent a diverse set of student and community needs to promote equitable
3 budgeting and district policies and to create central offices that provide
4 specialized resources and support for students and teachers in alignment with
5 best practices for teaching and learning.
6 Sec. 2. 16 V.S.A. § 43 is amended to read:
7 § 43. FEDERAL EDUCATION AID FUNDS; ADMINISTRATION; LOCAL
8 EDUCATION AGENCY
9 (a) The Agency, as sole state agency, may administer federal funds made
10 available to the State under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of
11 1965, Public L. No. 89-10, as amended, and the No Child Left Behind Act of
12 2001, Public L. No. 107-110. Those funds may be accepted and shall be
13 distributed and accounted for by the State Treasurer in accordance with that
14 law and rules and regulations of the United States issued under it if there is
15 conflict between that law or those rules and regulations and the laws of this
16 State.
17 (b) For purposes of distribution of funds under this section, a supervisory
18 union school district shall be a local education agency as that term is defined in
19 20 U.S.C. § 7801(26).
20 (c) For purposes of determining student performance and application of
21 consequences for failure to meet standards and for provision of compensatory

17 action ordered by the State Board shall be the least intrusive consistent with the
18 need to provide students attending the school substantially equal educational
19 opportunities. A school board aggrieved by an order of the State Board may
20 appeal the order in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure.

4 private right of action.
5 (e) If the Secretary determines at any time that the failure of a school to
6 meet the education quality standards listed in subsection (a) of this section is

2 course of study pursuant to section 906 of this title and that it substantially
3 complies with all statutory requirements for approved independent schools and
4 the Board’s rules for approved independent schools. An independent school
5 that intends to accept public tuition shall be approved by the State Board only
6 on the condition that the school agrees, notwithstanding any provision of law
7 to the contrary, to enroll any student who requires special education services
8 and who is placed in or referred to the approved independent school as an
9 appropriate placement and least restrictive environment for the student by the
10 student’s individualized education program team or by the local education
11 agency; provided, however, that this requirement shall not apply to an
12 independent school that limits enrollment to students who are on an
13 individualized education program or a plan under Section 504 of the
14 Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and who are enrolled pursuant to
15 a written agreement between the local education agency and the school. Except
16 as provided in subdivision (6) of this subsection, the Board’s rules must at
17 minimum require that the school have the resources required to meet its stated
18 objectives, including financial capacity, faculty who are qualified by training
19 and experience in the areas in which they are assigned, and physical facilities
20 and special services that are in accordance with any State or federal law or
21 regulation. Approval may be granted without State Board evaluation in the

1 case of any school accredited by a private, State, or regional agency recognized
2 by the State Board for accrediting purposes, provided that the State Board shall
3 determine that the school complies with all student enrollment provisions
4 required by law.
5 (1) On application, the State Board shall approve an independent school
6 that offers kindergarten but no other graded education if it finds, after
7 opportunity for hearing, that the school substantially complies with the Board’s
8 rules for approved independent kindergartens. The State Board may delegate to
9 another State agency the authority to evaluate the safety and adequacy of the
10 buildings in which kindergartens are conducted but shall consider all findings
11 and recommendations of any such agency in making its approval decision.
12 (2) Approvals under this subsection (b) shall be for a term established
13 by rule of the Board but not greater than five years.
14 (3) A approved independent school shall provide to the parent or
15 guardian responsible for each of its students, prior to accepting any money for
16 a student, an accurate statement in writing of its status under this section and a
17 copy of this section. Failure to comply with this provision may create a
18 permissible inference of false advertising in violation of 13 V.S.A. § 2005.
19 (4) Each approved independent school shall provide to the Secretary on
20 October 1 of each year the names, genders, dates of birth, and addresses of its
21 enrolled students. Within seven days of the termination of a student’s

3 officials as provided in section 1126 of this title.
4 (5) The State Board may revoke, suspend, or impose conditions upon
5 the approval of an approved independent school, after having provided an
6 opportunity for a hearing, for substantial failure to comply with the minimum
7 course of study, for failure to demonstrate that the school has the resources
8 required to meet its stated objectives, for failure to comply with statutory
9 requirements or the Board’s rules for approved independent schools, or for
10 failure to report under subdivision (4) of this subsection (b). Upon that
11 revocation or suspension, students required to attend school who are enrolled
12 in that school shall become truant unless they enroll in a public school, an
13 approved or recognized independent school, or a home study program.
14 (6) This subdivision (6) applies to an independent school located in
15 Vermont that offers a distance learning program and that, because of its
16 structure, does not meet some or all the rules of the State Board for approved
17 independent schools. In order to be approved under this subdivision, a school
18 shall meet the standards adopted by rule of the State Board for approved
19 independent schools that can be applied to the applicant school and any other
20 standards or rules adopted by the State Board regarding these types of schools.

15 the period of its approved status, then the Secretary shall notify the school in
16 writing of the reasons for this belief and permit the school a reasonable
17 opportunity to respond.
18 (ii) If the Secretary, after having provided the school a reasonable
19 opportunity to respond, does not find that the school has satisfactorily
20 responded or demonstrated its financial capacity, the Secretary may establish a

9 municipality to total long-term membership of the member municipality; and
10 the ratio of long-term membership attending a school other than the union

5 provide to that homeowner, by January 31, a certificate specifying the
6 allocated amount. The certificate shall indicate the proportion of total property
7 tax on the parcel that was assessed for municipal property tax and for statewide
8 property tax and the proportion of total value of the parcel. A homeowner

1 § 6066a. DETERMINATION OF HOMESTEAD PROPERTY TAX
2 EXEMPTION AND MUNICIPAL PROPERTY TAX CREDIT
3 (a) Annually, the Commissioner shall determine the homestead property tax
4 exemption and the municipal property tax credit amount under section 6066 of
5 this title, related to a homestead owned by the claimant, based on the prior
6 taxable year’s income and for the municipal property tax credit, crediting
7 property taxes paid in the prior year, and for the homestead property tax
8 exemption, exempting the housesite value in the claim year. The
9 Commissioner shall notify the municipality in which the housesite is located of
10 the amount of the homestead property tax exemption and municipal property
11 tax credit for the claimant for homestead property tax liabilities on a monthly
12 basis. The municipal property tax credit of a claimant who was assessed
13 property tax by a town that revised the dates of its fiscal year, however, is the
14 excess of the property tax that was assessed in the last 12 months of the revised
15 fiscal year, over the adjusted property tax of the claimant for the revised fiscal
16 year, as determined under section 6066 of this title, related to a homestead
17 owned by the claimant.
18 (b) The Commissioner shall include in the total homestead property tax
19 exemption and municipal property tax credit amount determined under
20 subsection (a) of this section, for credit to the taxpayer for homestead statewide
21 education property tax and school district spending tax liabilities, any income

1 tax overpayment remaining after allocation under section 3112 of this title and
2 setoff under section 5934 of this title, which the taxpayer has directed to be
3 used for payment of property taxes.
4 (c) The Commissioner shall notify the municipality of any claim and refund
5 amounts unresolved by November 1 at the time of final resolution, including
6 adjudication, if any; provided, however, that towns will not be notified of any
7 additional credit amounts after November 1 of the claim year, and such
8 amounts shall be paid to the claimant by the Commissioner.
9 (d) [Repealed.]
10 (e) At the time of notice to the municipality, the Commissioner shall notify
11 the taxpayer of the homestead property tax credit exemption amount
12 determined under subdivision 6066(a)(1) of this title, the amount determined
13 under subdivision 6066(a)(3) of this title,; any additional municipal property
14 credit amounts amount due the homestead owner under section subdivision
15 6066(a)(2) of this title,; the amount of income tax refund, if any, allocated to
16 payment of homestead statewide education property tax liabilities,; and any
17 late-claim reduction amount.
18 (f)(1) For taxpayers and amounts stated in the notice to towns on or before
19 July 1, municipalities shall create and send to taxpayers a homestead property
20 tax bill, instead of the bill required under subdivision 5402(b)(1) of this title,
21 providing the total amount allocated to payment of homestead statewide
VT LEG #380731 v.5

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.454

1 education property tax liabilities and notice of the balance due. Municipalities
2 shall apply the amount of the homestead property tax exemption allocated
3 under this chapter to current year property taxes in equal amounts to each of
4 the taxpayers’ property tax installments that include education taxes and the
5 amount of the municipal property tax credit allocated under this chapter to
6 current year municipal property taxes in equal amounts to each of the
7 taxpayers’ property tax installments that include municipal taxes.
8 Notwithstanding section 4772 of this title, if a town issues a corrected bill as a
9 result of the notice sent by the Commissioner under subsection (a) of this
10 section, issuance of the corrected new bill does not extend the time for
11 payment of the original bill nor relieve the taxpayer of any interest or penalties
12 associated with the original bill. If the corrected bill is less than the original
13 bill, and there are also no unpaid current year taxes, interest, or penalties, and
14 no past year delinquent taxes or penalties and interest charges, any
15 overpayment shall be reflected on the corrected tax bill and refunded to the
16 taxpayer.
17 (2) For homestead property tax exemption and municipal property tax
18 credit amounts for which municipalities receive notice after November 1,
19 municipalities shall issue a new homestead property tax bill with notice to the
20 taxpayer of the total amount allocated to payment of homestead property tax
21 liabilities and notice of the balance due.

1 (3) The homestead property tax exemption and municipal property tax
2 credit amount determined for the taxpayer shall be allocated first to current
3 year housesite value and property tax on the homestead parcel, next to current-
4 year homestead parcel penalties and interest, next to any prior year homestead
5 parcel penalties and interest, and last to any prior year housesite value and
6 property tax on the homestead parcel. No homestead property tax exemption
7 or municipal credit shall be allocated to a housesite value or property tax
8 liability for any year after the year for which the claim or refund allocation was
9 filed. No municipal tax-reduction incentive for early payment of taxes shall
10 apply to any amount allocated to the property tax bill under this chapter.
11 (4) If the homestead property tax exemption or the municipal property
12 tax credit amount as described in subsection (e) of this section exceeds the
13 property tax, penalties, and interest due for the current and all prior years, the
14 municipality shall refund the excess to the taxpayer, without interest, within 20
15 days of the first date upon which taxes become due and payable or 20 days
16 after notification of the exemption or credit amount by the Commissioner of
17 Taxes, whichever is later.
18 (g) The Commissioner of Taxes shall pay monthly to each municipality the
19 amount of municipal property tax credit of which the municipality was last
20 notified related to municipal property tax on homesteads within that
21 municipality, as determined by the Commissioner of Taxes.
