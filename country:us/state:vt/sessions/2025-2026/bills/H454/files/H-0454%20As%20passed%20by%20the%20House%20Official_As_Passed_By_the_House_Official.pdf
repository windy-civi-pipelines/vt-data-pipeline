8 of Education; State Board of Education
9 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to transform
10 Vermont’s education governance, quality, and finance systems. It would create
11 five school districts to govern the public education system for the entire State,
12 each governed by a school board and operated by a central office. This bill
13 also proposes to transform Vermont’s education financing system to a
14 foundation formula, with a base amount of $13,200.00 per student, in fiscal
15 year 2025, with additional weights based on student need, school scale, and
16 district sparsity, developed based on an evidence-based model that has been
17 adjusted to the Vermont context.
18 An act relating to transforming Vermont’s education governance, quality,
19 and finance systems

2 * * * Findings and Intent * * *
3 Sec. 1. FINDINGS; INTENT
4 The General Assembly finds that:
5 (1) The study commissioned in 2024 titled “An Evidence-Based
6 Approach to Identifying an Adequate Education Spending Level in Vermont”
7 by Allan Odden and Lawrence O. Picus evaluated Vermont education spending
8 against research-informed best practices. The evidence-based model is
9 designed to identify an array of staffing and resources that high-performing
10 schools need to provide every student with robust opportunities to meet
11 college and career-ready standards. Performing to those standards would
12 substantially improve student achievement and reduce demographic related
13 performance gaps.
14 (2) The evidence-based model represents an adequate model for the
15 level of education funding necessary to improve student achievement. It was
16 developed by experts in education funding with more than 25 years of
17 experience across the United States in determining how to adequately fund
18 schools, meaning providing a level of resources that would enable schools to
19 provide every student with an equal opportunity to learn to high performance
20 standards. The State has a Constitutional obligation to ensure that all students
21 are provided a quality education on a reasonably equal basis, without regard to

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 3 of 415
1 town of residence. Doing so will require significant change to the current
2 system of education.
3 (3) Vermont’s current funding model equalizes school district’s ability
4 to raise education taxes, leveling out the distinctions in property wealth among
5 districts. The current funding system does not provide equalized education
6 dollars to districts. The choice to spend or not spend equitable amounts of
7 education funding per student across the State rests with individual districts.
8 Spending patterns demonstrate that many districts do not utilize the tax
9 equalization mechanisms to increase spending, even in the districts with the
10 most demonstrated student need.
11 (4) Vermont’s current school and school district sizes do not align with
12 the Evidence-Based Model, and contribute to higher costs that are not fully
13 addressed by the Model. In order to ensure the Model can be implemented in
14 a way that improves education quality, the State must be organized into larger
15 school districts that are responsible for approximately at minimum 3,900
16 students, a population that represents the minimum to achieve efficiency in
17 delivering the Evidence-Based Model.
18 (5) Additionally, larger school districts, consistent with State-level
19 guidance for school size, average class size, and budgetary priorities, must
20 examine the appropriate number of schools for the student population,
21 geography, student need, and community desires of the school district.

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 4 of 415
1 (6) The intent of the proposed five districts is to charge school boards to
2 represent a diverse set of student and community needs to promote equitable
3 budgeting and district policies and to create central offices that provide
4 specialized resources and support for students and teachers in alignment with
5 best practices for teaching and learning.
6 Sec. 2. 16 V.S.A. § 43 is amended to read:
7 § 43. FEDERALEDUCATION AID FUNDS; ADMINISTRATION; LOCAL
8 EDUCATION AGENCY
9 (a) The Agency, as sole state agency, may administer federal funds made
10 available to the State under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of
11 1965, Public L. No. 89-10, as amended, and the No Child Left Behind Act of
12 2001, Public L. No. 107-110. Those funds may be accepted and shall be
13 distributed and accounted for by the State Treasurer in accordance with that
14 law and rules and regulations of the United States issued under it if there is
15 conflict between that law or those rules and regulations and the laws of this
16 State.
17 (b) For purposes of distribution of funds under this section, a supervisory
18 union school district shall be a local education agency as that term is defined in
19 20 U.S.C. § 7801(26).
20 (c) For purposes of determining student performance and application of
21 consequences for failure to meet standards and for provision of compensatory

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454

1 and remedial services pursuant to 20 U.S.C. §§ 6311–6318, a supervisory

11 effectiveness. The Secretary shall establish which data are to be included
12 pursuant to this subdivision and, notwithstanding that the other elements of the
13 report are to be presented in a format selected by the school board, shall

11 Vermont public school are provided educational opportunities substantially
12 equal to those provided in other public schools. If the Secretary determines
13 that a school is not meeting the education quality standards listed in subsection
14 (a) of this section or that the school is making insufficient progress in
15 improving student performance in relation to the standards for student
16 performance set forth in subdivision 164(9) of this title, he or she the Secretary
17 shall describe in writing actions that a district must take in order to meet either
18 or both sets of standards and shall provide technical assistance to the school.

21 one or more of the following actions:

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 21 of 415
1 (1) the Agency continue to provide technical assistance for one more
2 cycle of review;
3 (2) the State Board adjust supervisory union boundaries or
4 responsibilities of the superintendency pursuant to section 242 of this title;
5 (3) the Secretary assume administrative control of an individual school,
6 or school district, or supervisory union, including budgetary control to ensure
7 sound financial practices, only to the extent necessary to correct deficiencies;
8 (4) the State Board close an individual school or schools and require
9 that the school district pay tuition to another public school or an approved
10 independent school pursuant to chapter 21 of this title assign students to a
11 different school operated by the district; or
12 (5) the State Board require two or more school districts to consolidate
13 their governance structures.
14 (c) The State Board, after offering the school board an opportunity for a
15 hearing, shall either dismiss the Secretary’s recommendation or order that one
16 or more of the actions listed in subsection (b) of this section be taken. The
17 action ordered by the State Board shall be the least intrusive consistent with
18 the need to provide students attending the school substantially equal
19 educational opportunities. A school board aggrieved by an order of the State
20 Board may appeal the order in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure.

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 22 of 415
1 (d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to entitle any student to
2 educational programs or services identical to those received by students in the
3 same or any other school district. Further, nothing in this section shall create a
4 private right of action.
5 (e) If the Secretary determines at any time that the failure of a school to
6 meet the education quality standards listed in subsection (a) of this section is
7 severe or pervasive, potentially results in physical or emotional harm to
8 students or significant deprivation of equal education opportunities, and the
9 school has either unreasonably refused to remedy the problem or its efforts
10 have proved ineffective, he or she the Secretary may recommend to the State
11 Board one or more of the actions listed in subsection (b) of this section. The
12 State Board shall then follow the procedure of subsection (c) of this section.
13 (f) In order to be designated an independent school meeting education
14 quality standards, an independent school shall participate in the education
15 quality standards process of subsection (b) of this section. An independent
16 school shall receive technical assistance in accordance with the provisions of
17 subsection (b), but shall not be subject to subdivisions (b)(2)–(4) of this
18 section. The school shall be an independent school meeting education quality

17 (a) Authority. An independent school may operate and provide elementary
18 education or secondary education if it is either approved or recognized or
19 designated as a school choice school as set forth in this section.
20 (b) Approved independent schools. On application, the State Board shall
21 approve an independent school that offers elementary or secondary education

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 24 of 415
1 if it finds, after opportunity for hearing, that the school provides a minimum
2 course of study pursuant to section 906 of this title and that it substantially
3 complies with all statutory requirements for approved independent schools and
4 the Board’s rules for approved independent schools. An independent school
5 that intends to accept public tuition shall be approved by the State Board only
6 on the condition that the school agrees, notwithstanding any provision of law
7 to the contrary, to enroll any student who requires special education services
8 and who is placed in or referred to the approved independent school as an
9 appropriate placement and least restrictive environment for the student by the
10 student’s individualized education program team or by the local education
11 agency; provided, however, that this requirement shall not apply to an
12 independent school that limits enrollment to students who are on an
13 individualized education program or a plan under Section 504 of the
14 Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and who are enrolled pursuant to
15 a written agreement between the local education agency and the school. Except
16 as provided in subdivision (6) of this subsection, the Board’s rules must at
17 minimum require that the school have the resources required to meet its stated
18 objectives, including financial capacity, faculty who are qualified by training
19 and experience in the areas in which they are assigned, and physical facilities
20 and special services that are in accordance with any State or federal law or
21 regulation. Approval may be granted without State Board evaluation in the

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 25 of 415
1 case of any school accredited by a private, State, or regional agency
2 recognized by the State Board for accrediting purposes, provided that the State
3 Board shall determine that the school complies with all student enrollment
4 provisions required by law.
5 (1) On application, the State Board shall approve an independent school
6 that offers kindergarten but no other graded education if it finds, after
7 opportunity for hearing, that the school substantially complies with the
8 Board’s rules for approved independent kindergartens. The State Board may
9 delegate to another State agency the authority to evaluate the safety and
10 adequacy of the buildings in which kindergartens are conducted but shall
11 consider all findings and recommendations of any such agency in making its
12 approval decision.
13 (2) Approvals under this subsection (b) shall be for a term established
14 by rule of the Board but not greater than five years.
15 (3) A approved independent school shall provide to the parent or
16 guardian responsible for each of its students, prior to accepting any money for
17 a student, an accurate statement in writing of its status under this section and a
18 copy of this section. Failure to comply with this provision may create a
19 permissible inference of false advertising in violation of 13 V.S.A. § 2005.
20 (4) Each approved independent school shall provide to the Secretary on
21 October 1 of each year the names, genders, dates of birth, and addresses of its

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454

2 enrollment, the school choice school shall notify the Secretary of the name and
3 address of the student. The Secretary shall notify the appropriate school
4 officials as provided in section 1126 of this title.
5 (5) The State Board may revoke, suspend, or impose conditions upon
6 the approval of an approved independent school, after having provided an
7 opportunity for a hearing, for substantial failure to comply with the minimum
8 course of study, for failure to demonstrate that the school has the resources
9 required to meet its stated objectives, for failure to comply with statutory
10 requirements or the Board’s rules for approved independent schools, or for
11 failure to report under subdivision (4) of this subsection (b). Upon that
12 revocation or suspension, students required to attend school who are enrolled
13 in that school shall become truant unless they enroll in a public school, an
14 approved or recognized independent school, or a home study program.
15 (6) This subdivision (6) applies to an independent school located in
16 Vermont that offers a distance learning program and that, because of its
17 structure, does not meet some or all the rules of the State Board for approved
18 independent schools. In order to be approved under this subdivision, a school
19 shall meet the standards adopted by rule of the State Board for approved
20 independent schools that can be applied to the applicant school and any other
21 standards or rules adopted by the State Board regarding these types of schools.

7 inspecting entity, declaring satisfactory completion of the inspection and
8 identifying the date by which a new inspection must occur, shall be posted at
9 the school in a public location. The school shall provide a copy of the
10 certificate to the Secretary of Education after each annual inspection. The
11 school shall pay the actual cost of the inspection unless waived or reduced by
12 the inspecting entity.
13 (8)(A) If an approved independent school experiences any of the
14 following financial reporting events during the period of its approved status,
15 the school shall notify the Secretary of Education within five days after its
16 knowledge of the event unless the failure is de minimis:
17 (i) the school’s failure to file its federal or State taxreturns when
18 due, after permissible extension periods have been taken into account;
19 (ii) the school’s failure to meet its payroll obligations as they are
20 due or to pay federal or State payroll taxobligations as they are due;

7 months, including the school’s failure to make interest or principal payments
8 as they are due or to maintain any required financial ratios;
9 (vi) the withdrawal or conditioning of the school’s accreditation
10 on financial grounds by a private, State, or regional agency recognized by the
11 State Board for accrediting purposes; or
12 (vii) the school’s insolvency, as defined in 9 V.S.A. § 2286(a).
13 (B)(i) If the Secretary reasonably believes that an approved
14 independent school lacks financial capacity to meet its stated objectives during
15 the period of its approved status, then the Secretary shall notify the school in
16 writing of the reasons for this belief and permit the school a reasonable
17 opportunity to respond.
18 (ii) If the Secretary, after having provided the school a reasonable
19 opportunity to respond, does not find that the school has satisfactorily
20 responded or demonstrated its financial capacity, the Secretary may establish a

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 29 of 415
1 review team that, with the consent of the school, includes a member of the
2 Council of Independent Schools, to:
3 (I) conduct a school visit to assess the school’s financial
4 capacity;
5 (II) obtain from the school such financial documentation as the
6 review team requires to perform its assessment; and
7 (III) submit a report of its findings and recommendations to the
8 State Board.
9 (iii) If the State Board concludes that an approved independent
10 school lacks financial capacity to meet its stated objectives during the period
11 of its approved status, the State Board may take any action that is authorized
12 by this section.
13 (iv) In considering whether an independent school lacks financial
14 capacity to meet its stated objectives during the period of its approved status
15 and what actions the State Board should take if it makes this finding, the State
16 Board may consult with, and draw on the analytical resources of, the Vermont
17 Department of Financial Regulation.

9 guardian responsible for each of its students, prior to accepting any money for
10 a student, an accurate statement in writing of its status under this section and a

8 Notwithstanding section 4772 of this title, if a town issues a corrected bill as a
9 result of the notice sent by the Commissioner under subsection (a) of this
10 section, issuance of the corrected new bill does not extend the time for
11 payment of the original bill nor relieve the taxpayer of any interest or penalties
12 associated with the original bill. If the corrected bill is less than the original
13 bill, and there are also no unpaid current year taxes, interest, or penalties, and
14 no past year delinquent taxes or penalties and interest charges, any
15 overpayment shall be reflected on the corrected taxbill and refunded to the
16 taxpayer.
17 (2) For homestead property taxexemption and municipal property tax
18 credit amounts for which municipalities receive notice after November 1,
19 municipalities shall issue a new homestead property taxbill with notice to the
20 taxpayer of the total amount allocated to payment of homestead property tax
21 liabilities and notice of the balance due.

4 year homestead parcel penalties and interest, next to any prior year homestead
5 parcel penalties and interest, and last to any prior year housesite value and
6 property taxon the homestead parcel. No homestead property taxexemption
7 or municipal credit shall be allocated to a housesite value or property tax
8 liability for any year after the year for which the claim or refund allocation
9 was filed. No municipal tax-reduction incentive for early payment of taxes
10 shall apply to any amount allocated to the property taxbill under this chapter.
11 (4) If the homestead property taxexemption or the municipal property
12 taxcredit amount as described in subsection (e) of this section exceeds the
13 property tax, penalties, and interest due for the current and all prior years, the
14 municipality shall refund the excess to the taxpayer, without interest, within 20
15 days of the first date upon which taxes become due and payable or 20 days
16 after notification of the exemption or credit amount by the Commissioner of
17 Taxes, whichever is later.
18 (g) The Commissioner of Taxes shall pay monthly to each municipality the

* * * Findings and Intent * * *
Sec. 1. FINDINGS; INTENT; PLAN
(a) The General Assembly finds that:
(1) In 1997, the first piece of law the General Assembly enacted in
response to the Brigham decision stated, “[t]he right to public education is
integral to Vermont’s constitutional form of government and its guarantees of
political and civil rights…[and] fundamental for the success of Vermont’s
children in a rapidly-changing society and global marketplace as well as the
State’s own economic and social prosperity.” 16 V.S.A. § 1.

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 195 of 415
(2) From the very first attempt at creating a basic frame of government,
Vermont’s founders chose to include a right to public education, the only
governmental service included in Vermont’s first Constitution of 1777.
(3) As the U.S. Supreme Court stated in Brown v. Board of Education,
347 U.S. 483 (1954), “education is perhaps the most important function of
state and local governments…[i]t is required in the performance of our most
basic public responsibilities…[i]t is the very foundation of good citizenship.”
(5) The most enduring legacy of Brigham v. State, 166 Vt. 246 (1997) is
the State’s responsibility to ensure substantially equal educational
opportunities for all Vermont students.
(6) The education system is still reeling from the effects of a global
pandemic, yet the same challenges that have faced Vermont’s education system
remain. Thirty to 40 years ago, Vermont educated more than 110,000 students
each year. Today, there are approximately 84,000 students in the public
education system. Many schools have lost a significant number of students
and, with them, the ability to offer robust services and programs at every
school. Vermont’s youth need to be prepared for a rapidly evolving future.
(7) Vermonters deserve an exceptional educational system that is stable
and predictable and where a student’s home address does not dictate the
quality of education they receive. School district size and boundaries, school
size, and class size are all influential factors in shaping the quality of

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 196 of 415
instruction and overall student outcomes. The effectiveness of our schools
depends on teacher quality, resource availability, and the unique strengths of
local communities. Change in our educational system is needed. Systems are
made of people, so change must come carefully and thoughtfully, with
meaningful engagement by all Vermonters.
(b) Intent; plan.
(1) To ensure each student is provided substantially equal educational
opportunities that will prepare them to thrive in a 21st-century world, it is the
intent of the General Assembly to work strategically, intentionally, and
thoughtfully to ensure that each incremental change made to Vermont’s public
education system provides strength and support to its only constitutionally
required governmental service.
(2) It is further the intent of the General Assembly to:
(A) in the 2026 session, enact new, larger school district boundaries
and begin the process to create voting wards within each school district to
ensure school board membership is apportioned in such a manner as to
achieve substantially equal weighting of the votes of all voters in the election
of school board members;
(B) provide or enable the provision of the necessary staffing,
resources, and support to the Agency of Education, the Secretary of State’s
Office, town clerks, and other integral parties to the election system to hold the

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 197 of 415
first school board member elections within the newly created school districts in
November 2028; and
(C) provide or enable the provision of the necessary staffing,
resources, and support to the Agency of Education, State Board of Education,
and other integral parties to ensure that the necessary guidance and funding is
in place to allow for a smooth and successful transition between the operation
of Vermont’s current 119 school districts to the new, larger school districts,
with new school districts assuming responsibility for the education of all
resident students on July 1, 2029.

§ 165. EDUCATION QUALITY STANDARDS; EQUAL EDUCATIONAL
OPPORTUNITIES; INDEPENDENT SCHOOL MEETING

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 214 of 415
EDUCATION QUALITY STANDARDS
(a) In order to carry out Vermont’s policy that all Vermont children will be
afforded educational opportunities that are substantially equal in quality, each
Vermont public school, including each career technical center, shall meet the
following education quality standards:
* * *
(9) The school complies with average class size minimum standards;
provided, however, that when class size minimums apply to content areas, an
individual class may be smaller than the minimum average. As used in this
subdivision, “content area” means a group of courses within a specific
licensing endorsement area.
(A) Class size standards.
(i) The average class size minimum for kindergarten classes shall
be 12 students.
(ii) The average class size minimum for grades one through four
shall be 15 students.
(iii) The average class size minimum for grades five through 12 in
all required content area classes shall be 18 students.
(iv) Multiage classrooms for grades kindergarten through eight
shall be limited to two grade levels per classroom.

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 215 of 415
(v) Career and technical education, flexible pathways, terminal
courses, advanced placement courses, courses that require specialized
equipment, and driver’s education classes shall be excluded from the class size
minimum requirements in this subdivision (9). Small group services for the
purpose of providing special education, supplemental or targeted academic
intervention, or English learner instruction shall also be excluded from the
class size minimum requirements in this subdivision (9).
(vi) Class sizes shall not exceed the maximum occupancy limits
established by local and State fire codes, including egress and safety
requirements.
(B) Waivers. If a school board determines that it operates a school
that is unable to comply with the class size minimum standards due to
geographic isolation, or a school has developed an implementation plan to
meet the standards contained in this subdivision (9) that may include
consolidation or merger, the school board may ask the State Board of
Education to grant it waiver from this subdivision (9). The State Board shall
define what qualifies as geographic isolation in its rules adopted pursuant to
subdivision (a)(3) of this section. The State Board’s decision shall be final.
(C) State Board action. If the Secretary determines that a school is
not meeting the class size minimum standards set forth in this subdivision (9)
over the course of two consecutive school years, the Secretary shall

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 216 of 415
recommend to the State Board one or more of the actions listed in subsection
(b) of this section, regardless of whether the school is meeting all other
education quality standards. The State Board shall then follow the procedure
of subsection (c) of this section.
(b) Annually, the Secretary shall determine whether students in each
Vermont public school are provided educational opportunities substantially
equal to those provided in other public schools. If the Secretary determines
that a school is not meeting the education quality standards listed in
subsection (a) of this section or that the school is making insufficient progress
in improving student performance in relation to the standards for student
performance set forth in subdivision 164(9) of this title, he or she the Secretary
shall describe in writing actions that a district must take in order to meet
either or both sets of standards and shall provide technical assistance to the
school. If the school fails to meet the standards or make sufficient progress
within two years of following the determination, the Secretary shall
recommend to the State Board one or more of the following actions:
(1) the Agency continue to provide technical assistance for one more
cycle of review;
(2) the State Board adjust supervisory union boundaries or
responsibilities of the superintendency pursuant to section 261 of this title;

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 217 of 415
(3) the Secretary assume administrative control of an individual school,
school district, or supervisory union, including budgetary control to ensure
sound financial practices, only to the extent necessary to correct deficiencies;
(4) the State Board close an individual school or schools and require
that the school district pay tuition to another public school or an approved
independent school pursuant to chapter 21 of this title; or
(5) the State Board require two or more school districts to consolidate
their governance structures.
(c) The State Board, after offering the school board an opportunity for a
hearing, shall either dismiss the Secretary’s recommendation or order that one
or more of the actions listed in subsection (b) of this section be taken. The
action ordered by the State Board shall be the least intrusive consistent with
the need to provide students attending the school substantially equal
educational opportunities. A school board aggrieved by an order of the State
Board may appeal the order in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure.
* * *
(e) If the Secretary determines at any time that the failure of a school to
meet the education quality standards listed in subsection (a) of this section is
severe or pervasive, potentially results in physical or emotional harm to
students or significant deprivation of equal education opportunities, and the
school has either unreasonably refused to remedy the problem or its efforts

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 218 of 415
have proved ineffective, he or she the Secretary may recommend to the State
Board one or more of the actions listed in subsection (b) of this section. The
State Board shall then follow the procedure of subsection (c) of this section.
* * *
(g) In addition to the education quality standards provided in subsection
(a) of this section, each Vermont school district shall meet the school district
quality standards adopted by rule of the Agency of Education regarding the
business, facilities management, and governance practices of school districts.
These standards shall include a process for school district quality reviews to be
conducted by the Agency of Education. Annually, the Secretary shall publish
metrics regarding the outcomes of school district quality reviews.
Sec. 5. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH EDUCATION QUALITY
STANDARDS; STATE BOARD ACTION
Notwithstanding 16 V.S.A. § 165(b)(4) and (5) and any other provision of
law to the contrary, the State Board shall be prohibited from ordering school
district consolidation or school consolidation if a school fails to comply with
class size minimum education quality standards and the resulting consolidation
would result in school construction costs in excess of the applicable district’s
capital reserve account until the General Assembly establishes new school
district boundaries and takes further action regarding the consequences for
failure to meet education quality standards.

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 219 of 415
Sec. 6. STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION; RULES; REPORT
(a) Rules.
(1) The State Board of Education shall initiate rulemaking to amend the
Education Quality Standards rule 2000 series, Agency of Education,
Education Quality Standards (22-000-003), pursuant to 3 V.S.A. chapter 25:
(A) on or before August 1, 2026, to ensure compliance with the class
size minimum standards set pursuant to 16 V.S.A. § 165(a)(9); and
(B) On or before July 1, 2027, to adopt standards for statewide
proficiency-based graduation requirements based on standards adopted by the

that intend to accept public tuition to comply with the class size minimum
standards set pursuant to 16 V.S.A. § 165(a)(9). The amendments shall also
create a process for review by the State Board for failure to meet the class size
minimum requirements and the corresponding actions the Board may take for
such noncompliance; provided, however, that the Board shall provide an
approved independent school a substantially similar opportunity to come into

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 220 of 415
compliance with class size minimum standards that it would provide to a
public school.
(b) Report. On or before December 1, 2025, the State Board of Education
shall submit a written report to the House and Senate Committees on
Education with proposed standards for schools to be deemed “small by
necessity.”
Sec. 7. SCHOOL SIZE; INTENT
(a) It is the intent of the General Assembly to encourage the efficient use of
public funds to modernize school infrastructure to deliver identified 21st
century educational goals.
(b) It is further the intent of the General Assembly that each public school
operating grades six through 12, or some subset of those grades, shall have a
minimum average daily membership of at least 450 students, at least in part by
providing a robust State aid for school construction program that is driven by
standards for quality for public schools, geographic accessibility, statewide
enrollment trends, and capacity and scale that support substantially equal
educational opportunities for all Vermont students.
Sec. 8. PROHIBITION ON SCHOOL CLOSURE AND TRANSITION TO
PAYING TUITION
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a school district shall
be prohibited from closing an existing public school and then providing for the

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 221 of 415
education of its resident students by paying tuition for its students to attend a
public or approved independent school chosen by the parents of the district’s
students. If a school district that closes an existing public school is unable to
provide for the education of its affected resident students in a different school
or schools operated by the district, the school district shall provide for the
education of its resident students by designating three or fewer public schools
to serve as the public school or schools of the district, in accordance with the
process contained in 16 V.S.A. § 827.
Sec. 9. 16 V.S.A. § 3440 is added to read:
§ 3440. STATEMENT OF POLICY
It is the intent of this chapter to encourage the efficient use of public funds
to modernize school infrastructure in alignment with current educational
needs. School construction projects supported by this chapter should be
developed taking consideration of standards of quality for public schools under
section 165 of this title and prioritizing cost, geographic accessibility, 21st
century education facilities standards, statewide enrollment trends, and
capacity and scale that support best educational practices. Further, it is the
intent of this chapter to encourage the use of existing infrastructure to meet the
needs of Vermont students. Joint construction projects between two or more
school districts and consolidation of buildings within a district where feasible
and educationally appropriate are encouraged.

* * * Findings and Intent * * *
Sec. 1. FINDINGS; INTENT; PLAN
(a) The General Assembly finds that:
(1) In 1997, the first piece of law the General Assembly enacted in
response to the Brigham decision stated, “[t]he right to public education is
integral to Vermont’s constitutional form of government and its guarantees of
political and civil rights…[and] fundamental for the success of Vermont’s
children in a rapidly-changing society and global marketplace as well as the
State’s own economic and social prosperity.” 16 V.S.A. § 1.
(2) From the very first attempt at creating a basic frame of government,
Vermont’s founders chose to include a right to public education, the only
governmental service included in Vermont’s first Constitution of 1777.
(3) As the U.S. Supreme Court stated in Brown v. Board of Education,
347 U.S. 483 (1954), “education is perhaps the most important function of
state and local governments…[i]t is required in the performance of our most
basic public responsibilities…[i]t is the very foundation of good citizenship.”
(4) The most enduring legacy of Brigham v. State, 166 Vt. 246 (1997) is
the State’s responsibility to ensure substantially equal educational
opportunities for all Vermont students.

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 246 of 415
(5) The education system is still reeling from the effects of a global
pandemic, yet the same challenges that have faced Vermont’s education system
remain. Thirty to 40 years ago, Vermont educated more than 110,000 students
each year. Today, there are approximately 84,000 students in the public
education system. Many schools have lost a significant number of students
and, with them, the ability to offer robust services and programs at every
school. Vermont’s youth need to be prepared for a rapidly evolving future.
(6) Vermonters deserve an exceptional educational system that is stable
and predictable and where a student’s home address does not dictate the
quality of education they receive. School district size and boundaries, school
size, and class size are all influential factors in shaping the quality of
instruction and overall student outcomes. The effectiveness of our schools
depends on teacher quality, resource availability, and the unique strengths of
local communities. Change in our educational system is needed. Systems are
made of people, so change must come carefully and thoughtfully, with
meaningful engagement by all Vermonters.
(b) Intent; plan.
(1) To ensure each student is provided substantially equal educational
opportunities that will prepare them to thrive in a 21st-century world, it is the
intent of the General Assembly to work strategically, intentionally, and
thoughtfully to ensure that each incremental change made to Vermont’s public

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 247 of 415
education system provides strength and support to its only constitutionally
required governmental service.
(2) It is further the intent of the General Assembly to:
(A) in the 2026 session:
(i) enact new, larger school district boundaries that would be
effective July 1, 2027;
(ii) enact updates to career and technical education governance
systems, both at the local and statewide levels, that are reflective of the larger
public education governance transformation to new, larger school districts;
(iii) create a coordinated and coherent statewide strategy for
career and technical education that is responsive to students and the State’s
workforce needs and that provides opportunities for more integration between
career and technical education and traditional high school work;
(iv) enact student-centered updates to career and technical
education funding within a foundation formula that does not create
competition between sending schools and career and technical education
programs for available funds; and
(v) begin the process to create voting wards within each school
district to ensure school board membership is apportioned in such a manner as
to achieve substantially equal weighting of the votes of all voters in the
election of school board members;

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 248 of 415
(B) provide or enable the provision of the necessary staffing,
resources, and support to the Agency of Education, the Secretary of State’s
Office, town clerks, and other integral parties to the election system to hold the
first school board member elections within the newly created school districts in
a special election in March 2028; and
(C) provide or enable the provision of the necessary staffing,
resources, and support to the Agency of Education, State Board of Education,
and other integral parties to ensure that the necessary guidance and funding is
in place to allow for a smooth and successful transition between the operation
of Vermont’s current 119 school districts to the new, larger school districts,
with new school districts assuming responsibility for the education of all
resident students on July 1, 2029.

It is the intent of the General Assembly to transform education in Vermont
by leveraging attainable and research-based scale to increase equity of
opportunity and promote efficiency and affordability.
Sec. 4. 16 V.S.A. § 165 is amended to read:
§ 165. EDUCATION QUALITY STANDARDS; EQUAL EDUCATIONAL
OPPORTUNITIES; INDEPENDENT SCHOOL MEETING
EDUCATION QUALITY STANDARDS
(a) In order to carry out Vermont’s policy that all Vermont children will be
afforded educational opportunities that are substantially equal in quality, each
Vermont public school, including each career technical center, shall meet the
following education quality standards:
* * *
(9) The school complies with average class size minimum standards;
provided, however, that when class size minimums apply to content areas, an
individual class may be smaller than the minimum average. As used in this
subdivision, “content area” means a group of courses within a specific
licensing endorsement area.
(A) Class size standards.
(i) The average class size minimum for kindergarten classes shall
be 12 students.

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 270 of 415
(ii) The average class size minimum for grades one through four
shall be 15 students.
(iii) The average class size minimum for grades five through 12 in
all required content area classes shall be 18 students.
(iv) Multiage classrooms for grades kindergarten through eight
shall be limited to two grade levels per classroom.
(v) Prekindergarten, career and technical education, flexible
pathways, terminal courses, advanced placement courses, courses that require
specialized equipment, and driver’s education classes shall be excluded from
the class size minimum requirements in this subdivision (9). Small group
services for the purpose of providing special education, supplemental or
targeted academic intervention, or English learner instruction shall also be
excluded from the class size minimum requirements in this subdivision (9).
(vi) Class sizes shall not exceed the maximum occupancy limits
established by local and State fire codes, including egress and safety
requirements.
(B) Waivers. If a school board determines that it operates a school
that is unable to comply with the class size minimum standards due to
geographic isolation, or a school has developed an implementation plan to
meet the standards contained in this subdivision (9) that may include
consolidation or merger, the school board may ask the State Board of

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 271 of 415
Education to grant it waiver from this subdivision (9). The State Board shall
define what qualifies as geographic isolation in its rules adopted pursuant to
subdivision (a)(3) of this section. The State Board’s decision shall be final.
(C) State Board action. If the Secretary determines that a school is
not meeting the class size minimum standards set forth in this subdivision (9)
over the course of two consecutive school years, the Secretary shall
recommend to the State Board one or more of the actions listed in subsection
(b) of this section, regardless of whether the school is meeting all other
education quality standards. The State Board shall then follow the procedure
of subsection (c) of this section.
(b) Annually, the Secretary shall determine whether students in each
Vermont public school are provided educational opportunities substantially
equal to those provided in other public schools. If the Secretary determines
that a school is not meeting the education quality standards listed in
subsection (a) of this section or that the school is making insufficient progress
in improving student performance in relation to the standards for student
performance set forth in subdivision 164(9) of this title, he or she the Secretary
shall describe in writing actions that a district must take in order to meet
either or both sets of standards and shall provide technical assistance to the
school. If the school fails to meet the standards or make sufficient progress

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 272 of 415
within two years of following the determination, the Secretary shall
recommend to the State Board one or more of the following actions:
(1) the Agency continue to provide technical assistance for one more
cycle of review;
(2) the State Board adjust supervisory union boundaries or
responsibilities of the superintendency pursuant to section 261 of this title;
(3) the Secretary assume administrative control of an individual school,
school district, or supervisory union, including budgetary control to ensure
sound financial practices, only to the extent necessary to correct deficiencies;
(4) the State Board close an individual school or schools and require
that the school district pay tuition to another public school or an approved
independent school pursuant to chapter 21 of this title; or
(5) the State Board require two or more school districts to consolidate
their governance structures.
(c) The State Board, after offering the school board an opportunity for a
hearing, shall either dismiss the Secretary’s recommendation or order that one
or more of the actions listed in subsection (b) of this section be taken. The
action ordered by the State Board shall be the least intrusive consistent with
the need to provide students attending the school substantially equal
educational opportunities. A school board aggrieved by an order of the State
Board may appeal the order in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure.

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 273 of 415
* * *
(e) If the Secretary determines at any time that the failure of a school to
meet the education quality standards listed in subsection (a) of this section is
severe or pervasive, potentially results in physical or emotional harm to
students or significant deprivation of equal education opportunities, and the
school has either unreasonably refused to remedy the problem or its efforts
have proved ineffective, he or she the Secretary may recommend to the State
Board one or more of the actions listed in subsection (b) of this section. The
State Board shall then follow the procedure of subsection (c) of this section.
* * *
(g) In addition to the education quality standards provided in subsection
(a) of this section, each Vermont school district shall meet the school district
quality standards adopted by rule of the Agency of Education regarding the
business, facilities management, and governance practices of school districts.
These standards shall include a process for school district quality reviews to be
conducted by the Agency of Education. Annually, the Secretary shall publish
metrics regarding the outcomes of school district quality reviews.
Sec. 5. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH EDUCATION QUALITY
STANDARDS; STATE BOARD ACTION
Notwithstanding 16 V.S.A. § 165(b)(4) and (5) and any other provision of
law to the contrary, the State Board shall be prohibited from ordering school

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 274 of 415
district consolidation or school consolidation if a school fails to comply with
class size minimum education quality standards and the resulting consolidation
would result in school construction costs in excess of the applicable district’s
capital reserve account until the General Assembly establishes new school
district boundaries and takes further action regarding the consequences for
failure to meet education quality standards.
Sec. 6. STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION; RULES; REPORT
(a) Rules.
(1) The State Board of Education shall initiate rulemaking to amend the
Education Quality Standards rule 2000 series, Agency of Education,
Education Quality Standards (22-000-003), pursuant to 3 V.S.A. chapter 25:
(A) on or before August 1, 2026, to ensure compliance with the class
size minimum standards set pursuant to 16 V.S.A. § 165(a)(9); and
(B) on or before July 1, 2027, to adopt standards for statewide
proficiency-based graduation requirements based on standards adopted by the
State Board and recommendations from the Agency of Education, which shall
take effect beginning in the 2027–2028 school year for the graduating class of
2031 and every graduating class thereafter.
(2) On or before August 1, 2026, the State Board of Education shall
initiate rulemaking to amend the approved independent school rule 2200

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 275 of 415
004), pursuant to 3 V.S.A. chapter 25, to require approved independent schools
that intend to accept public tuition to comply with the class size minimum
standards set pursuant to 16 V.S.A. § 165(a)(9). The amendments shall also
create a process for review by the State Board for failure to meet the class size
minimum requirements and the corresponding actions the Board may take for
such noncompliance; provided, however, that the Board shall provide an
approved independent school a substantially similar opportunity to come into
compliance with class size minimum standards that it would provide to a
public school.
(b) Report. On or before December 1, 2025, the State Board of Education
shall submit a written report to the House and Senate Committees on
Education with proposed standards for schools to be deemed “small by
necessity.”
Sec. 7. SCHOOL SIZE; INTENT
(a) It is the intent of the General Assembly to encourage the efficient use of
public funds to modernize school infrastructure to deliver identified 21st
century educational goals.
(b) It is further the intent of the General Assembly that each public school
operating grades six through 12, or some subset of those grades, shall have a
minimum average daily membership of at least 450 students, at least in part by
providing a robust State aid for school construction program that is driven by

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 276 of 415
standards for quality for public schools, geographic accessibility, statewide
enrollment trends, and capacity and scale that support substantially equal
educational opportunities for all Vermont students.
Sec. 8. PROHIBITION ON SCHOOL CLOSURE AND TRANSITION TO
PAYING TUITION
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a school district shall
be prohibited from closing an existing public school and then providing for the
education of its resident students by paying tuition for its students to attend a
public or approved independent school chosen by the parents of the district’s
students. If a school district that closes an existing public school is unable to
provide for the education of its affected resident students in a different school
or schools operated by the district, the school district shall provide for the
education of its resident students by designating three or fewer public schools
to serve as the public school or schools of the district. Notwithstanding any
provision of law to the contrary, if designation is required pursuant to this
section, the designation process contained in 16 V.S.A. § 827 shall apply to
schools operating grades kindergarten through grade 12, or any subset of
grades therein.
Sec. 9. 16 V.S.A. § 3440 is added to read:

century education facilities standards, statewide enrollment trends, and
capacity and scale that support best educational practices. Further, it is the
intent of this chapter to encourage the use of existing infrastructure to meet the
needs of Vermont students. Joint construction projects between two or more
school districts and consolidation of buildings within a district where feasible
and educationally appropriate are encouraged.
Sec. 10. 16 V.S.A. § 3442 is added to read:
§ 3442. STATE AID FOR SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM

supplemental district spending tax payment to the State based on grand list
information received by the Commissioner not later than the March 15 prior to
the June 1 net payment. Payment shall be accompanied by a return prescribed
by the Commissioner of Taxes. Each municipality may retain 0.225 of one

(i) Adjustments The homestead property tax exemption and the municipal
property tax credit under subsection (a) of this section shall be calculated
without regard to any exemption under subdivision 3802(11) of this title.
§ 6066a. DETERMINATION OF HOMESTEAD PROPERTY TAX
EXEMPTION AND MUNICIPAL PROPERTY TAX CREDIT
(a) Annually, the Commissioner shall determine the homestead property tax
exemption and the municipal property tax credit amount under section 6066 of
this title, related to a homestead owned by the claimant, based on the prior
taxable year’s income and for the municipal property tax credit, crediting
property taxes paid in the prior year, and for the homestead property tax
exemption, exempting the housesite value in the claim year. The
Commissioner shall notify the municipality in which the housesite is located of
the amount of the homestead property tax exemption and municipal property
tax credit for the claimant for homestead property tax liabilities on a monthly
basis. The municipal property tax credit of a claimant who was assessed
property tax by a town that revised the dates of its fiscal year, however, is the
excess of the property tax that was assessed in the last 12 months of the revised
fiscal year, over the adjusted property tax of the claimant for the revised fiscal

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 371 of 415
year, as determined under section 6066 of this title, related to a homestead
owned by the claimant.
(b) The Commissioner shall include in the total homestead property tax
exemption and municipal property tax credit amount determined under
subsection (a) of this section, for credit to the taxpayer for homestead
statewide education property tax and supplemental district spending tax
liabilities, any income tax overpayment remaining after allocation under
section 3112 of this title and setoff under section 5934 of this title, which the
taxpayer has directed to be used for payment of property taxes.
(c) The Commissioner shall notify the municipality of any claim and refund
amounts unresolved by November 1 at the time of final resolution, including
adjudication, if any; provided, however, that towns will not be notified of any
additional credit amounts after November 1 of the claim year, and such
amounts shall be paid to the claimant by the Commissioner.
(d) [Repealed.]
(e) At the time of notice to the municipality, the Commissioner shall notify
the taxpayer of the homestead property tax credit exemption amount
determined under subdivision 6066(a)(1) of this title, the amount determined
under subdivision 6066(a)(3) of this title,; any additional municipal property
credit amounts amount due the homestead owner under section subdivision
6066(a)(2) of this title,; the amount of income tax refund, if any, allocated to

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 372 of 415
payment of homestead statewide education property tax liabilities,; and any
late-claim reduction amount.
(f)(1) For taxpayers and amounts stated in the notice to towns on or before
July 1, municipalities shall create and send to taxpayers a homestead property
tax bill, instead of the bill required under subdivision 5402(b)(1) of this title,
providing the total amount allocated to payment of homestead statewide
education property tax liabilities and notice of the balance due. Municipalities
shall apply the amount of the homestead property tax exemption allocated
under this chapter to current year property taxes in equal amounts to each of
the taxpayers’ property tax installments that include education taxes and the
amount of the municipal property tax credit allocated under this chapter to
current year municipal property taxes in equal amounts to each of the
taxpayers’ property tax installments that include municipal taxes.
Notwithstanding section 4772 of this title, if a town issues a corrected bill as a
result of the notice sent by the Commissioner under subsection (a) of this
section, issuance of the corrected new bill does not extend the time for payment
of the original bill nor relieve the taxpayer of any interest or penalties
associated with the original bill. If the corrected bill is less than the original
bill, and there are also no unpaid current year taxes, interest, or penalties, and
no past year delinquent taxes or penalties and interest charges, any

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 373 of 415
overpayment shall be reflected on the corrected tax bill and refunded to the
taxpayer.
(2) For homestead property tax exemption and municipal property tax
credit amounts for which municipalities receive notice after November 1,
municipalities shall issue a new homestead property tax bill with notice to the
taxpayer of the total amount allocated to payment of homestead property tax
liabilities and notice of the balance due.
(3) The homestead property tax exemption and municipal property tax
credit amount determined for the taxpayer shall be allocated first to current
year housesite value and property tax on the homestead parcel, next to current-
year homestead parcel penalties and interest, next to any prior year homestead
parcel penalties and interest, and last to any prior year housesite value and
property tax on the homestead parcel. No homestead property tax exemption
or municipal credit shall be allocated to a housesite value or property tax
liability for any year after the year for which the claim or refund allocation
was filed. No municipal tax-reduction incentive for early payment of taxes
shall apply to any amount allocated to the property tax bill under this chapter.
(4) If the homestead property tax exemption or the municipal property
tax credit amount as described in subsection (e) of this section exceeds the
property tax, penalties, and interest due for the current and all prior years, the
