quality, and finance systems.
(H.454)
It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
* * * Findings and Intent * * *
Sec. 1. FINDINGS; INTENT; PLAN
(a) The General Assembly finds that:
(1) In 1997, the first piece of law the General Assembly enacted in
response to Brigham v. State, 166 Vt. 246 (1997) stated, “[t]he right to public
education is integral to Vermont’s constitutional form of government and its
guarantees of political and civil rights…[and] fundamental for the success of
Vermont’s children in a rapidly-changing society and global marketplace as
well as the State’s own economic and social prosperity.” 16 V.S.A. § 1.
(2) From the very first attempt at creating a basic frame of government,
Vermont’s founders chose to include a right to public education, the only
governmental service included in Vermont’s first Constitution of 1777.
(3) As the U.S. Supreme Court stated in Brown v. Board of Education,
347 U.S. 483 (1954), “education is perhaps the most important function of
state and local governments…[i]t is required in the performance of our most
basic public responsibilities…[i]t is the very foundation of good citizenship.”
(4) The most enduring legacy of Brigham is the State’s responsibility to
ensure substantially equal educational opportunities for all Vermont students.
VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 2 of 147
2025
(5) The education system is still reeling from the effects of a global
pandemic, yet the same challenges that have faced Vermont’s education
system remain. Thirty to 40 years ago, Vermont educated more than 110,000
students each year. Today, there are approximately 84,000 students in the
public education system. Many schools have lost a significant number of
students and, with them, the ability to offer robust services and programs at
every school. Vermont’s youth need to be prepared for a rapidly evolving
future.
(6) Vermonters deserve an exceptional educational system that is stable
and predictable and where a student’s home address does not dictate the
quality of education they receive. School district size and boundaries, school
size, and class size are all influential factors in shaping the quality of
instruction and overall student outcomes. The effectiveness of our schools
depends on teacher quality, resource availability, and the unique strengths of
local communities. Change in our educational system is needed. Systems are
made of people, so change must come carefully and thoughtfully, with
meaningful engagement by all Vermonters.
(b) Intent; plan.
(1) To ensure each student is provided substantially equal educational
opportunities that will prepare them to thrive in a 21st-century world, it is the
intent of the General Assembly to work strategically, intentionally, and
thoughtfully to ensure that each incremental change made to Vermont’s public
VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 3 of 147
2025
education system provides strength and support to its only constitutionally
required governmental service.
(2) It is further the intent of the General Assembly to:
(A) in the 2026 session:
(i) enact new, larger school district boundaries that would be
effective July 1, 2026;
(ii) enact updates to career and technical education governance
systems, both at the local and statewide levels, that are reflective of the larger
public education governance transformation to new, larger school districts;
(iii) create a coordinated and coherent statewide strategy for career
and technical education that is responsive to students and the State’s workforce
needs and that provides opportunities for more integration between career and
technical education and traditional high school work;
(iv) enact student-centered updates to fully fund career and
technical education within a foundation formula that does not create
competition between sending schools and career and technical education
programs for available funds nor exceed current spending levels;
(v) begin the process to create voting wards within each school
district to ensure school board membership is apportioned in such a manner as
to achieve substantially equal weighting of the votes of all voters in the
election of school board members; and
VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 4 of 147
2025
(vi) establish an appropriate weight for prekindergarten students,
as well as enact changes to the publicly funded prekindergarten program that
ensure costs are borne by the appropriate funding source depending on the age
of the student and the prekindergarten education provider;
(B) provide or enable the provision of the necessary staffing,
resources, and support to the Agency of Education, the Secretary of State’s
Office, town clerks, and other integral parties to the election system to hold the
first school board member elections within the newly created school districts in
a special election in November 2027; and
(C) provide or enable the provision of the necessary staffing,
resources, and support to the Agency of Education, State Board of Education,
and other integral parties to ensure that the necessary guidance and funding is
in place to allow for a smooth and successful transition between the operation
of Vermont’s current 119 school districts to the new, larger school districts,
with new school districts assuming responsibility for the education of all
resident students on July 1, 2028.
(3) It is further the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that the
imposition of the new statewide education tax rate contemplated by this act
does not result in an increase of education property tax bills relative to
Vermont’s current education funding system for municipalities across
Vermont. The General Assembly intends to mitigate or reduce property tax
bills for Vermonters by, among other things:
VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 5 of 147
2025
(A) enacting new school district boundaries that increase the
efficiency of the delivery of educational services through scale;
(B) addressing inefficiencies of education delivery through
programmatic updates to prekindergarten, career and technical education, and
special education;
(C) improving staffing ratios to increase sustainability and reduce
costs;
(D) addressing high-cost, languishing physical school infrastructure
through implementation of a new State aid for school construction program;
(E) evaluating and consolidating education governance structures to
reduce administrative costs and burdens;
(F) stabilizing education property taxes by transitioning from an
education funding system that funds locally varying budgets to a foundation
formula that funds predictable educational opportunity payments;
(G) implementing a foundation formula with costs reflective of the
most efficient method of delivery of education services to Vermont pupils of
all educational needs within Vermont’s existing education structure;
(H) providing a process for regular recalibration of the foundation
formula to reduce costs over time as educational efficiencies are gained
through the implementation of new governance and programmatic structures;
(I) reserving support for small and sparse schools for schools that are
small or sparse by necessity;
VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 6 of 147
2025
(J) shifting certain education and other related costs off of the
Education Fund and on to other sources of funding that do not impact the
property tax bills of Vermonters;
(K) implementing equalizing measures for any local spending
additional to educational opportunity payments that reserve funds within the
Education Fund to reduce following-year property tax bills;
(L) imposing a cap on local spending additional to educational
opportunity payments to limit property tax rate increases through the
supplemental district spending tax;
(M) providing transitionary measures to ease school district
movement from current education spending to educational opportunity
payments under the new foundation formula; and
(N) replacing the existing property tax credit with a homestead
exemption that increases income sensitivity benefits to Vermonters with low
and moderate income and smooths existing income sensitivity benefit cliffs.

REPORT; MAPS
(a) Creation. There is created the School District Voting Ward Working
Group to create voting district wards within the new school districts
contemplated by this act, to ensure school board membership is apportioned in
such a manner as to achieve substantially equal weighting of the votes of all
voters in the choice of school board members.
(b) Membership. The Working Group shall be composed of the following
members who shall have substantial understanding of Vermont geography,
trade, travel, social interaction, and Vermont’s public education system:
VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 25 of 147
2025
(1) the Secretary of State or designee, who shall be the chair;
(2) three members, who shall be appointed by the Vermont Municipal
Clerk Treasurer Association;
(3) two members, appointed by the Vermont School Boards
Association; and

(c) Powers and duties. On or before October 15, 2025, the Working Group
shall consult with the School District Redistricting Task Force created in Sec. 3
of this act to gain an understanding of the status of the work of the Task Force
and to determine whether the Task Force has one or more boundary proposals
ready for the Working Group to begin the work of creating voting wards.
Using the boundary proposals of the Task Force, the Working Group shall,
following the principles of apportionment followed by the legislative
apportionment board, make recommendations to the General Assembly to
achieve voting districts within each school district that are compact,
contiguous, and drawn to achieve substantially equal weighting of votes and
that meet the requirements of applicable State and federal law. If at any time
during the work of the Working Group, the General Assembly enacts new
school district boundaries, or it appears clear the General Assembly is focused
on only one proposal, the Working Group shall focus its work and
VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 26 of 147
2025
recommendations to align with the work of the General Assembly. The
Working Group’s recommendations shall include:

maximize public representation and democratic input while maintaining
effective school board size; and
(2) boundaries for school district voting wards within each school
district, with alternative options if necessary, including detailed maps clearly
and unambiguously delineating ward boundaries that respect current municipal
boundary lines.
(d) Assistance. The Working Group shall have the administrative,
technical, and legal assistance of the Secretary of State’s office and the
technical assistance of the Agency of Digital Services, Vermont Center for
Geographic Information. The Working Group may contract for such expert
services as may be necessary to carry out its duties.
(e) Meetings.
(1) The Secretary of State shall call the first meeting of the Working
Group to occur on or before October 1, 2025.

Section 4:
§ 165. EDUCATION QUALITY STANDARDS; EQUAL EDUCATIONAL
OPPORTUNITIES; INDEPENDENT SCHOOL MEETING
EDUCATION QUALITY STANDARDS
(a) In order to carry out Vermont’s policy that all Vermont children will be
afforded educational opportunities that are substantially equal in quality, each
VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 28 of 147
2025
Vermont public school, including each career technical center, shall meet the
following education quality standards:
* * *
(9) The school complies with average class size minimum standards;
provided, however, that when class size minimums apply to content areas, an
individual class may be smaller than the minimum average. As used in this
subdivision, “content area” means a group of courses within a specific
licensing endorsement area.
(A) Class size standards.
(i) The average class size minimum for first-grade classes shall be
10 students.
(ii) The average class size minimum for grades two through five
shall be 12 students.
(iii) The average class size minimum for grades six through eight
in all required content areas shall be 15 students.
(iv) The average class size minimum for grades nine through 12 in
all required content area classes shall be 18 students.
(v) Multiage classrooms for grades kindergarten through eight
shall be limited to two grade levels per classroom.
(vi) Prekindergarten, kindergarten, career and technical education,
flexible pathways, terminal courses, advanced placement courses, courses that
require specialized equipment, and driver’s education classes shall be excluded
VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 29 of 147
2025
from the class size minimum requirements in this subdivision (9). Small group
services for the purpose of providing special education, supplemental or
targeted academic intervention, or English learner instruction shall also be
excluded from the class size minimum requirements in this subdivision (9).
(vii) Class sizes shall not exceed the maximum occupancy limits
established by local and State fire codes, including egress and safety
requirements.
(B) Waivers. If a school board determines that it operates a school
that is unable to comply with the class size minimum standards due to
geographic isolation, or a school has developed an implementation plan to
meet the standards contained in this subdivision (9) that may include
consolidation or merger, the school board may ask the State Board of
Education to grant it waiver from this subdivision (9). The State Board shall
define what qualifies as geographic isolation in its rules adopted pursuant to
subdivision (a)(3) of this section. The State Board’s decision shall be final.
(C) State Board action. If the Secretary determines that a school is
not meeting the class size minimum standards set forth in this subdivision (9)
over the course of three consecutive school years, the Secretary may
recommend to the State Board one or more of the actions listed in subsection
(b) of this section, regardless of whether the school is meeting all other
education quality standards. The State Board shall then follow the procedure
of subsection (c) of this section.
VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 30 of 147
2025
(b) Annually, the Secretary shall determine whether students in each
Vermont public school are provided educational opportunities substantially
equal to those provided in other public schools. If the Secretary determines
that a school is not meeting the education quality standards listed in subsection
(a) of this section or that the school is making insufficient progress in
improving student performance in relation to the standards for student
performance set forth in subdivision 164(9) of this title, he or she the Secretary
shall describe in writing actions that a district must take in order to meet either
or both sets of standards and shall provide technical assistance to the school. If
the school fails to meet the standards or make sufficient progress within two
years of following the determination, the Secretary shall recommend to the
State Board one or more of the following actions:
(1) the Agency continue to provide technical assistance for one more
cycle of review;
(2) the State Board adjust supervisory union boundaries or
responsibilities of the superintendency pursuant to section 261 of this title;
(3) the Secretary assume administrative control of an individual school,
school district, or supervisory union, including budgetary control to ensure
sound financial practices, only to the extent necessary to correct deficiencies;
(4) the State Board close an individual school or schools and require that
the school district pay tuition to another public school or an approved
independent school pursuant to chapter 21 of this title; or
VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 31 of 147
2025
(5) the State Board require two or more school districts to consolidate
their governance structures.
(c) The State Board, after offering the school board an opportunity for a
hearing, shall either dismiss the Secretary’s recommendation or order that one
or more of the actions listed in subsection (b) of this section be taken. The
action ordered by the State Board shall be the least intrusive consistent with the
need to provide students attending the school substantially equal educational
opportunities. A school board aggrieved by an order of the State Board may
appeal the order in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure.
* * *
(e) If the Secretary determines at any time that the failure of a school to
meet the education quality standards listed in subsection (a) of this section is
severe or pervasive, potentially results in physical or emotional harm to
students or significant deprivation of equal education opportunities, and the
school has either unreasonably refused to remedy the problem or its efforts
have proved ineffective, he or she the Secretary may recommend to the State
Board one or more of the actions listed in subsection (b) of this section. The
State Board shall then follow the procedure of subsection (c) of this section.

Sec. 7. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH EDUCATION QUALITY
STANDARDS; STATE BOARD ACTION
VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 32 of 147
2025
Notwithstanding 16 V.S.A. § 165(b)(4) and (5) and any other provision of
law to the contrary, the State Board shall be prohibited from ordering school
district consolidation or school consolidation if a school fails to comply with
class size minimum education quality standards and the resulting consolidation
would result in school construction costs in excess of the applicable district’s
capital reserve account until the General Assembly establishes new school
district boundaries and takes further action regarding the consequences for
failure to meet education quality standards.

pupil included in long-term membership residing in a low population density
school district, measured by the number of persons per square mile residing
within the land area of the geographic boundaries of the district as of July 1 of
the year of determination, who is a Newcomer or SLIFE shall receive an
additional weighting amount of: 0.42

(C) 0.07, where the number of persons per square mile is 55 or more
but fewer than 100.
(5) The Secretary shall lastly apply a weight for pupils who attend a
small school. If the number of persons per square mile residing within the land
area of the geographic boundaries of a school district as of July 1 of the year of
determination is 55 or fewer, then, for each pupil listed under subdivision
(b)(3)(C) of this section (pupils who attend small schools) Special education
weights. Each child with a disability included in long-term membership shall
receive an additional weighting amount, based on the categorization of the
child’s disability, of:
(A) where the school has fewer than 100 pupils in average two-year
enrollment, the school district shall receive an additional weighting amount of

Section 20:
0.21 for each pupil included in the small school’s average two-year enrollment

term membership plus the cumulation of the weights assigned by the Secretary
under this subsection.
(e) Hold harmless. A district’s weighted long-term membership shall in no
case be less than 96 and one-half percent of its actual weighted long-term
membership the previous year prior to making any adjustment under this
subsection.
(f) Determination of per pupil education spending educational opportunity
payment. As soon as reasonably possible after a school district budget is
approved by voters, the Secretary shall determine the per pupil education
spending for the next fiscal year for the school district. Per pupil education
spending shall equal a school district’s education spending divided by its
weighted long-term membership The Secretary shall determine each school
district’s educational opportunity payment by multiplying the school district’s
weighted long-term membership determined under subsection (d) of this

Secretary of Education by the supplemental district spending yield. The
legislative body in each member municipality shall then bill each property
taxpayer at the rate determined by the Commissioner under this subsection,
divided by the number resulting from dividing the municipality’s most recent
common level of appraisal by the statewide adjustment and multiplied by the
current grand list value of the property to be taxed. The bill shall show the tax
due and the calculation of the rate.

2025
cooperative declared as a homestead may only include the homestead and a pro
rata share of any common land owned or leased by the cooperative, not to
exceed the two-acre housesite limitation. The share of the cooperative’s
assessed value attributable to the housesite shall be determined by the
cooperative and specified annually in a notice to the co-op member. Property
taxes paid by a mobile home park cooperative, allocable to property used as a
housesite, shall be attributed to the owner of the housesite for the purpose of

VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 119 of 147
2025
allocated amount as property tax paid on the land with the amount of property

the credit property tax liability under this section. The allocated amount shall
be determined by the nonprofit corporation or community land trust on a
proportional basis. The nonprofit corporation or community land trust shall
provide to that homeowner, by January 31, a certificate specifying the
allocated amount. The certificate shall indicate the proportion of total property
tax on the parcel that was assessed for municipal property tax and for statewide
property tax and the proportion of total value of the parcel. A homeowner
under this subsection shall be entitled to a property tax credit in an amount
determined by multiplying the property taxes allocated under this subsection
by the percentage of the exemption for which the homeowner’s household
income qualifies under subdivision (a)(1) of this section.
(h) A homestead owner shall be entitled to an additional property tax credit
amount equal to one percent of the amount of income tax refund that the
claimant elects to allocate to payment of homestead statewide education
property tax under section 6068 of this title.

Section 48:
§ 6066a. DETERMINATION OF HOMESTEAD PROPERTY TAX
EXEMPTION AND MUNICIPAL PROPERTY TAX CREDIT
VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 120 of 147
2025
(a) Annually, the Commissioner shall determine the homestead property
tax exemption and the municipal property tax credit amount under section
6066 of this title, related to a homestead owned by the claimant, based on the
prior taxable year’s income and for the municipal property tax credit, crediting
property taxes paid in the prior year, and for the homestead property tax
exemption, exempting the housesite value in the claim year. The
Commissioner shall notify the municipality in which the housesite is located of
the amount of the homestead property tax exemption and municipal property
tax credit for the claimant for homestead property tax liabilities on a monthly
basis. The municipal property tax credit of a claimant who was assessed
property tax by a town that revised the dates of its fiscal year, however, is the
excess of the property tax that was assessed in the last 12 months of the revised
fiscal year, over the adjusted property tax of the claimant for the revised fiscal
year, as determined under section 6066 of this title, related to a homestead
owned by the claimant.
(b) The Commissioner shall include in the total homestead property tax
exemption and municipal property tax credit amount determined under
subsection (a) of this section, for credit to the taxpayer for homestead statewide
education property tax and supplemental district spending tax liabilities, any
income tax overpayment remaining after allocation under section 3112 of this
title and setoff under section 5934 of this title, which the taxpayer has directed
to be used for payment of property taxes.
VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 121 of 147
2025
(c) The Commissioner shall notify the municipality of any claim and
refund amounts unresolved by November 1 at the time of final resolution,
including adjudication, if any; provided, however, that towns will not be
notified of any additional credit amounts after November 1 of the claim year,
and such amounts shall be paid to the claimant by the Commissioner.
(d) [Repealed.]
(e) At the time of notice to the municipality, the Commissioner shall notify
the taxpayer of the homestead property tax credit exemption amount
determined under subdivision 6066(a)(1) of this title, the amount determined
under subdivision 6066(a)(3) of this title,; any additional municipal property
credit amounts amount due the homestead owner under section subdivision
6066(a)(2) of this title,; the amount of income tax refund, if any, allocated to
payment of homestead statewide education property tax liabilities,; and any
late-claim reduction amount.
(f)(1) For taxpayers and amounts stated in the notice to towns on or before
July 1, municipalities shall create and send to taxpayers a homestead property
tax bill, instead of the bill required under subdivision 5402(b)(1) of this title,
providing the total amount allocated to payment of homestead statewide
education property tax liabilities and notice of the balance due. Municipalities
shall apply the amount of the homestead property tax exemption allocated
under this chapter to current year property taxes in equal amounts to each of
the taxpayers’ property tax installments that include education taxes and the
VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 122 of 147
2025
amount of the municipal property tax credit allocated under this chapter to
current year municipal property taxes in equal amounts to each of the
taxpayers’ property tax installments that include municipal taxes.
Notwithstanding section 4772 of this title, if a town issues a corrected bill as a
result of the notice sent by the Commissioner under subsection (a) of this

Section 49:
section, issuance of the corrected new bill does not extend the time for
payment of the original bill nor relieve the taxpayer of any interest or penalties
associated with the original bill. If the corrected bill is less than the original
bill, and there are also no unpaid current year taxes, interest, or penalties, and
no past year delinquent taxes or penalties and interest charges, any
overpayment shall be reflected on the corrected tax bill and refunded to the
taxpayer.
(2) For homestead property tax exemption and municipal property tax
credit amounts for which municipalities receive notice after November 1,
municipalities shall issue a new homestead property tax bill with notice to the
taxpayer of the total amount allocated to payment of homestead property tax
liabilities and notice of the balance due.
(3) The homestead property tax exemption and municipal property tax
credit amount determined for the taxpayer shall be allocated first to current
year housesite value and property tax on the homestead parcel, next to current-
year homestead parcel penalties and interest, next to any prior year homestead
parcel penalties and interest, and last to any prior year housesite value and
VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 123 of 147
2025
property tax on the homestead parcel. No homestead property tax exemption
or municipal credit shall be allocated to a housesite value or property tax
liability for any year after the year for which the claim or refund allocation was
filed. No municipal tax-reduction incentive for early payment of taxes shall
apply to any amount allocated to the property tax bill under this chapter.
(4) If the homestead property tax exemption or the municipal property
tax credit amount as described in subsection (e) of this section exceeds the
property tax, penalties, and interest due for the current and all prior years, the
municipality shall refund the excess to the taxpayer, without interest, within 20
days of the first date upon which taxes become due and payable or 20 days
after notification of the exemption or credit amount by the Commissioner of
Taxes, whichever is later.
(g) The Commissioner of Taxes shall pay monthly to each municipality the
amount of municipal property tax credit of which the municipality was last
notified related to municipal property tax on homesteads within that
municipality, as determined by the Commissioner of Taxes.

(d) A parcel with two or more portions qualifying for different tax
classifications under this section shall be classified proportionally based on the

classification.
(e) The Commissioner shall amend existing forms, and publish new forms,
as needed to gather the necessary attestations and declarations required under

Sec. 61a. PROPERTY TAX CLASSIFICATIONS; TRANSITION; DATA
COLLECTION
For calendar year 2027, the Commissioner of Taxes shall amend and create
forms so that taxpayers report information on the use of their property for such
property to be classified as homestead, nonhomestead residential,
nonhomestead nonresidential, or a proportional classification of those uses.
The information collected, and classifications determined, shall align with the
definitions and requirements of Sec. 61 of this act. The Commissioner shall
use the information to determine and assign a tax classification for every grand
list parcel and, on or before October 1, 2027, the Commissioner shall provide
that information to the Joint Fiscal Office.
Sec. 61b. PROPERTY TAX CLASSIFICATIONS IMPLEMENTATION
REPORT
(a) The Commissioner of Taxes shall study the implementation of new
property tax classifications under this act and identify any further actions
required by the Department of Taxes, Vermont municipalities, and the General
Assembly to successfully implement the new tax classification system on the
timeline established by this act. The issues considered by the Commissioner
shall include any adjustments to the statutory definitions, any needed changes
to existing forms, whether new forms or taxpayer filings are needed, and how
the Department could identify parcels with dwelling units that do not have an
affiliated homestead declaration or landlord certificate on file.
VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 135 of 147
2025
(b) The Commissioner shall additionally recommend sets of tax rate
multipliers to be applied under 32 V.S.A. § 5402(a) as amended by this act.
(1) The Commissioner shall recommend a multiplier set that would
ensure any new revenue derived from the nonhomestead residential
classification would cover the cost to the Education Fund caused by the
homestead property tax exemption under 32 V.S.A. § 6066(a) as amended by
this act.
(2) The Commissioner shall recommend a different multiplier set that
would ensure that any new revenue derived from the nonhomestead residential
classification would mitigate forecasted property tax increases on homestead
property taxpayers caused by the implementation of this act.
(c) On or before December 15, 2025, the Commissioner of Taxes shall
submit a study report detailing the Commissioner’s findings under this section
to the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on
Finance.
Sec. 61c. TAX CLASSIFICATIONS; RATE MULTIPLIERS; INTENT
It is the intent of the General Assembly that the creation of a tax
classification system, and the specific tax classifications to be used by that
system, will be reevaluated at the same time as any further amendment of the
tax rate multipliers created under 32 V.S.A. § 6066(a) as amended by this act.
VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 136 of 147
2025
Sec. 61d. PROSPECTIVE REPEAL OF TAX CLASSIFICATIONS
In order to ensure successful implementation of education finance reform as
set forth in this act, in the absence of legislative action on or before July 1,
2028 that creates a new tax rate multiplier to be used in a tax classification
system, subdivision (f)(10) of Sec. 70 of this act is repealed on July 1, 2028.

No. 73 Page 139 of 147
2025
advising on the implementation of regional assessment districts and on the
development of guidelines, procedures, and rules needed to effectuate a

* * * Miscellaneous Tax * * *
Sec. 65. 32 V.S.A. § 6066a(f)(1) is amended to read:
(f)(1) For taxpayers and amounts stated in the notice to towns on or before
July 1, municipalities shall create and send to taxpayers a homestead property
tax bill, instead of the bill required under subdivision 5402(b)(1) of this title,
providing the total amount allocated to payment of homestead education
property tax liabilities and notice of the balance due. Nothing in this
VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 140 of 147
2025
subdivision, however, shall be interpreted as altering the requirement under
subdivision 5402(b)(2) of this title that the statewide education homestead tax
be billed in a manner that is stated clearly and separately from any other tax.
Municipalities shall apply the amount allocated under this chapter to current
year property taxes in equal amounts to each of the taxpayers’ property tax
installments that include education taxes. Notwithstanding section 4772 of this
title, if a town issues a corrected bill as a result of the notice sent by the
Commissioner under subsection (a) of this section, issuance of the corrected
new bill does not extend the time for payment of the original bill nor relieve
the taxpayer of any interest or penalties associated with the original bill. If the
corrected bill is less than the original bill, and there are also no unpaid current
year taxes, interest, or penalties, and no past year delinquent taxes or penalties
and interest charges, any overpayment shall be reflected on the corrected tax
bill and refunded to the taxpayer.
Sec. 66. 32 V.S.A. § 5252 is amended to read:

Section 64:
§ 5252. LEVY AND NOTICE OF SALE; SECURING PROPERTY
(a) When the collector of taxes of a town or of a municipality within it has
for collection a tax assessed against real estate in the town and the taxpayer
owes a minimum of $1,500.00 and is delinquent for a period longer than one
year, the collector may extend a warrant on such land. However, no warrant
shall be extended until a delinquent taxpayer is given an opportunity to enter a
written reasonable repayment plan pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. If
VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 141 of 147
2025
a collector receives notice from a mobile home park owner pursuant to 10
V.S.A. § 6248(b), the collector shall, within 15 days after the notice,
commence tax sale proceedings to hold a tax sale within 60 days after the
notice. If the collector fails to initiate such proceedings, the town may initiate
tax sale proceedings only after complying with 10 V.S.A. § 6249(f). If the tax
collector extends the warrant, the collector shall:

Sec. 67. 32 V.S.A. § 4465 is amended to read:

Section 65:
§ 4465. APPOINTMENT OF PROPERTY VALUATION HEARING
OFFICER; OATH; PAY
When an appeal to the Director is not withdrawn or forwarded by the
Director to Superior Court pursuant to subsection 4461(a) of this title, the
Director shall refer the appeal in writing to a person not employed by the
Director, appointed by the Director as hearing officer. The Director shall have
the right to remove a hearing officer for inefficiency, malfeasance in office, or
other cause. In like manner, the Director shall appoint a hearing officer to fill
any vacancy created by resignation, removal, or other cause. Before entering
into their duties, persons appointed as hearing officers shall take and subscribe
the oath of the office prescribed in the Constitution, which oath shall be filed
with the Director. The Director Commissioner of Taxes shall pay each hearing
officer a sum not to exceed $150.00 per diem for each day wherein hearings
are held $38.00 per hour plus a cost-of-living adjustment in an amount equal to
VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 142 of 147
2025
any adjustment approved for exempt employees by the Secretary of
Administration, together with reasonable expenses as the Director
Commissioner may determine. A hearing officer may subpoena witnesses,
records, and documents in the manner provided by law for serving subpoenas
in civil actions and may administer oaths to witnesses.
Sec. 68. 32 V.S.A. § 5402(c)(2) is amended to read:
(2) The Secretary of Education shall determine each municipality’s net
nonhomestead education tax payment and its net homestead education tax
payment to the State based on grand list information received by the Secretary
not later than the March 15 prior to the June 1 net payment. Payment shall be
accompanied by a return prescribed by the Secretary of Education. Each
municipality may retain 0.225 of one percent of the total education tax
collected, only upon timely remittance of net payment to the State Treasurer or
to the applicable school district or districts. Each municipality may also retain
$15.00 for each late property tax credit claim filed after April 15 and before
September 2, as notified by the Department of Taxes, for the cost of issuing a
new property tax bill.
Sec. 69. 32 V.S.A. § 5401(13) is amended to read:
(13)(A) “Education property tax spending adjustment” means the
greater of one or a fraction in which:
(i) the numerator is the district’s per pupil education spending plus
excess spending for the school year, and
VT LEG #384389 v.1
No. 73 Page 143 of 147
2025
(ii) the denominator is the property dollar equivalent yield for the
school year, as defined in subdivision (15) of this section, multiplied by the
statewide adjustment.
(B) “Education income tax spending adjustment” means the greater
of one or a fraction in which the numerator is the district’s per pupil education
spending plus excess spending for the school year, and the denominator is the
income dollar equivalent yield for the school year, as defined in subdivision
(16) of this section.

Raw Text:
No. 73 Page 1 of 147
2025
No. 73. An act relating to transforming Vermont’s education governance,
quality, and finance systems.
(H.454)
It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
* * * Findings and Intent * * *
Sec. 1. FINDINGS; INTENT; PLAN
(a) The General Assembly finds that:
(1) In 1997, the first piece of law the General Assembly enacted in
response to Brigham v. State, 166 Vt. 246 (1997) stated, “[t]he right to public
education is integral to Vermont’s constitutional form of government and its
guarantees of political and civil rights…[and] fundamental for the success of
Vermont’s children in a rapidly-changing society and global marketplace as
well as the State’s own economic and social prosperity.” 16 V.S.A. § 1.
(2) From the very first attempt at creating a basic frame of government,
Vermont’s founders chose to include a right to public education, the only
governmental service included in Vermont’s first Constitution of 1777.
(3) As the U.S. Supreme Court stated in Brown v. Board of Education,
347 U.S. 483 (1954), “education is perhaps the most important function of
state and local governments…[i]t is required in the performance of our most
basic public responsibilities…[i]t is the very foundation of good citizenship.”
(4) The most enduring legacy of Brigham is the State’s responsibility to
ensure substantially equal educational opportunities for all Vermont students.
VT LEG #384389 v.1

No. 73 Page 2 of 147
2025
(5) The education system is still reeling from the effects of a global
pandemic, yet the same challenges that have faced Vermont’s education
system remain. Thirty to 40 years ago, Vermont educated more than 110,000
students each year. Today, there are approximately 84,000 students in the
public education system. Many schools have lost a significant number of
students and, with them, the ability to offer robust services and programs at
every school. Vermont’s youth need to be prepared for a rapidly evolving
future.
(6) Vermonters deserve an exceptional educational system that is stable
and predictable and where a student’s home address does not dictate the
quality of education they receive. School district size and boundaries, school
size, and class size are all influential factors in shaping the quality of
instruction and overall student outcomes. The effectiveness of our schools
depends on teacher quality, resource availability, and the unique strengths of
local communities. Change in our educational system is needed. Systems are
made of people, so change must come carefully and thoughtfully, with
meaningful engagement by all Vermonters.
(b) Intent; plan.
(1) To ensure each student is provided substantially equal educational
opportunities that will prepare them to thrive in a 21st-century world, it is the
intent of the General Assembly to work strategically, intentionally, and
thoughtfully to ensure that each incremental change made to Vermont’s public
VT LEG #384389 v.1

No. 73 Page 3 of 147
2025
education system provides strength and support to its only constitutionally
required governmental service.
(2) It is further the intent of the General Assembly to:
(A) in the 2026 session:
(i) enact new, larger school district boundaries that would be
effective July 1, 2026;
(ii) enact updates to career and technical education governance
systems, both at the local and statewide levels, that are reflective of the larger
public education governance transformation to new, larger school districts;
(iii) create a coordinated and coherent statewide strategy for career
and technical education that is responsive to students and the State’s workforce
needs and that provides opportunities for more integration between career and
technical education and traditional high school work;
(iv) enact student-centered updates to fully fund career and
technical education within a foundation formula that does not create
competition between sending schools and career and technical education
programs for available funds nor exceed current spending levels;
(v) begin the process to create voting wards within each school

additional to educational opportunity payments that reserve funds within the
Education Fund to reduce following-year property tax bills;
(L) imposing a cap on local spending additional to educational
opportunity payments to limit property tax rate increases through the
supplemental district spending tax;
(M) providing transitionary measures to ease school district
movement from current education spending to educational opportunity

OPPORTUNITIES; INDEPENDENT SCHOOL MEETING
EDUCATION QUALITY STANDARDS
(a) In order to carry out Vermont’s policy that all Vermont children will be
afforded educational opportunities that are substantially equal in quality, each
VT LEG #384389 v.1

No. 73 Page 28 of 147
2025
Vermont public school, including each career technical center, shall meet the
following education quality standards:
* * *
(9) The school complies with average class size minimum standards;
provided, however, that when class size minimums apply to content areas, an
individual class may be smaller than the minimum average. As used in this
subdivision, “content area” means a group of courses within a specific
licensing endorsement area.
(A) Class size standards.
(i) The average class size minimum for first-grade classes shall be
10 students.
(ii) The average class size minimum for grades two through five
shall be 12 students.
(iii) The average class size minimum for grades six through eight
in all required content areas shall be 15 students.
(iv) The average class size minimum for grades nine through 12 in
all required content area classes shall be 18 students.
(v) Multiage classrooms for grades kindergarten through eight
shall be limited to two grade levels per classroom.
(vi) Prekindergarten, kindergarten, career and technical education,
flexible pathways, terminal courses, advanced placement courses, courses that
require specialized equipment, and driver’s education classes shall be excluded
VT LEG #384389 v.1

No. 73 Page 29 of 147
2025
from the class size minimum requirements in this subdivision (9). Small group
services for the purpose of providing special education, supplemental or
targeted academic intervention, or English learner instruction shall also be
excluded from the class size minimum requirements in this subdivision (9).
(vii) Class sizes shall not exceed the maximum occupancy limits
established by local and State fire codes, including egress and safety
requirements.
(B) Waivers. If a school board determines that it operates a school
that is unable to comply with the class size minimum standards due to
geographic isolation, or a school has developed an implementation plan to
meet the standards contained in this subdivision (9) that may include
consolidation or merger, the school board may ask the State Board of
Education to grant it waiver from this subdivision (9). The State Board shall
define what qualifies as geographic isolation in its rules adopted pursuant to
subdivision (a)(3) of this section. The State Board’s decision shall be final.
(C) State Board action. If the Secretary determines that a school is
not meeting the class size minimum standards set forth in this subdivision (9)
over the course of three consecutive school years, the Secretary may
recommend to the State Board one or more of the actions listed in subsection
(b) of this section, regardless of whether the school is meeting all other
education quality standards. The State Board shall then follow the procedure
of subsection (c) of this section.
VT LEG #384389 v.1

No. 73 Page 30 of 147
2025
(b) Annually, the Secretary shall determine whether students in each
Vermont public school are provided educational opportunities substantially
equal to those provided in other public schools. If the Secretary determines
that a school is not meeting the education quality standards listed in subsection
(a) of this section or that the school is making insufficient progress in
improving student performance in relation to the standards for student
performance set forth in subdivision 164(9) of this title, he or she the Secretary
shall describe in writing actions that a district must take in order to meet either
or both sets of standards and shall provide technical assistance to the school. If
the school fails to meet the standards or make sufficient progress within two
years of following the determination, the Secretary shall recommend to the
State Board one or more of the following actions:
(1) the Agency continue to provide technical assistance for one more
cycle of review;
(2) the State Board adjust supervisory union boundaries or
responsibilities of the superintendency pursuant to section 261 of this title;
(3) the Secretary assume administrative control of an individual school,
school district, or supervisory union, including budgetary control to ensure
sound financial practices, only to the extent necessary to correct deficiencies;
(4) the State Board close an individual school or schools and require that
the school district pay tuition to another public school or an approved
independent school pursuant to chapter 21 of this title; or
VT LEG #384389 v.1

No. 73 Page 31 of 147
2025
(5) the State Board require two or more school districts to consolidate
their governance structures.
(c) The State Board, after offering the school board an opportunity for a
hearing, shall either dismiss the Secretary’s recommendation or order that one
or more of the actions listed in subsection (b) of this section be taken. The
action ordered by the State Board shall be the least intrusive consistent with the
need to provide students attending the school substantially equal educational
opportunities. A school board aggrieved by an order of the State Board may
appeal the order in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure.
* * *
(e) If the Secretary determines at any time that the failure of a school to
meet the education quality standards listed in subsection (a) of this section is
severe or pervasive, potentially results in physical or emotional harm to
students or significant deprivation of equal education opportunities, and the
school has either unreasonably refused to remedy the problem or its efforts
have proved ineffective, he or she the Secretary may recommend to the State
Board one or more of the actions listed in subsection (b) of this section. The
State Board shall then follow the procedure of subsection (c) of this section.
* * *
Sec. 7. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH EDUCATION QUALITY
STANDARDS; STATE BOARD ACTION
VT LEG #384389 v.1

No. 73 Page 32 of 147
2025
Notwithstanding 16 V.S.A. § 165(b)(4) and (5) and any other provision of
law to the contrary, the State Board shall be prohibited from ordering school
district consolidation or school consolidation if a school fails to comply with
class size minimum education quality standards and the resulting consolidation
would result in school construction costs in excess of the applicable district’s
capital reserve account until the General Assembly establishes new school
district boundaries and takes further action regarding the consequences for
failure to meet education quality standards.

long-term membership, as defined in subdivision 4001(7) of this title, in that
category.
(1) The Secretary shall first apply grade level weights Prekindergarten
weight. Each pupil included in long-term membership shall count as one,
multiplied by the following amounts:
(A) who is enrolled in prekindergarten— shall receive an additional
weighting amount of negative 0.54;

(C) grades nine through 12—0.39.
(2) The Secretary shall next apply a Economic disadvantage weight for
pupils whose family is at or below 185 percent of FPL. Each pupil included in
long-term membership whose family is at or below 185 percent of FPL shall
receive an additional weighting amount of 1.03 1.02.
(3) The Secretary shall next apply a weight for EL pupils EL proficiency
weights. Each EL pupil included in long-term membership shall receive an
additional weighting amount, based on the EL pupil’s English language
proficiency level, of 2.49:
(A) 2.11, if assessed as Level 1;
(B) 1.41, if assessed as Level 2 or 3;
(C) 1.20, if assessed as Level 4; or
(D) 0.12, if assessed as Level 5 or 6.
(4) The Secretary shall then apply a weight for pupils living in low
population density school districts EL Newcomer/SLIFE weight. Each EL
pupil included in long-term membership residing in a low population density
school district, measured by the number of persons per square mile residing
within the land area of the geographic boundaries of the district as of July 1 of
the year of determination, who is a Newcomer or SLIFE shall receive an
additional weighting amount of: 0.42
(A) 0.15, where the number of persons per square mile is fewer than
36 persons;
VT LEG #384389 v.1

No. 73 Page 75 of 147

(B) 0.12, where the number of persons per square mile is 36 or more
but fewer than 55 persons; or
(C) 0.07, where the number of persons per square mile is 55 or more
but fewer than 100.
(5) The Secretary shall lastly apply a weight for pupils who attend a
small school. If the number of persons per square mile residing within the land
area of the geographic boundaries of a school district as of July 1 of the year of
determination is 55 or fewer, then, for each pupil listed under subdivision
(b)(3)(C) of this section (pupils who attend small schools) Special education
weights. Each child with a disability included in long-term membership shall
receive an additional weighting amount, based on the categorization of the
child’s disability, of:
(A) where the school has fewer than 100 pupils in average two-year
enrollment, the school district shall receive an additional weighting amount of
0.21 for each pupil included in the small school’s average two-year enrollment
0.79, if the disability is identified as Category A; or
(B) where the small school has 100 or more but fewer than 250
pupils, the school district shall receive an additional weighting amount of 0.07
for each pupil included in the small school’s average two-year enrollment 1.89,
if the disability is identified as Category B; or
(C) 2.49, if the disability is identified as Category C.
VT LEG #384389 v.1

(6) A school district’s weighted long-term membership shall equal long-
term membership plus the cumulation of the weights assigned by the Secretary
under this subsection.
(e) Hold harmless. A district’s weighted long-term membership shall in no
case be less than 96 and one-half percent of its actual weighted long-term
membership the previous year prior to making any adjustment under this
subsection.
(f) Determination of per pupil education spending educational opportunity
payment. As soon as reasonably possible after a school district budget is
approved by voters, the Secretary shall determine the per pupil education
spending for the next fiscal year for the school district. Per pupil education
spending shall equal a school district’s education spending divided by its
weighted long-term membership The Secretary shall determine each school
district’s educational opportunity payment by multiplying the school district’s
weighted long-term membership determined under subsection (d) of this
section by the base amount.

expenditures from the Education Fund other than supplemental district
spending, after accounting for forecasted non-property tax revenues and any
funds unreserved in the Education Fund following the process under 16 V.S.A.
§ 4032(c). It is the intention of the General Assembly that the statewide
education tax rate under this section shall be adopted for each fiscal year by act

education tax rate for a fiscal year, the statewide education tax rate for the
fiscal year shall equal the product of 110 percent and the statewide education

nonhomestead applicable rate determined by the Commissioner under this
subdivision, multiplied by the education property tax grand list value of the
property, properly classified as homestead or nonhomestead property and

under this chapter. Statewide education property tax bills shall show the tax
due and the calculation of the rate determined under subsection (a) of this
section, divided by the number resulting from dividing the municipality’s most
recent common level of appraisal by the statewide adjustment, multiplied by

may be on a single sheet of paper with the statewide education tax and other
taxes presented separately and side by side.
(3) If a district has not voted a budget by June 30, an interim homestead

adjustment, but without regard to any spending adjustment under subdivision
5401(13) of this title. Within 30 days after a budget is adopted and the
deadline for reconsideration has passed, the Commissioner shall determine the

this subdivision (2), with weighting based upon the ratio of union school long-
term membership, as defined in 16 V.S.A. § 4001(7), from the member
municipality to total long-term membership of the member municipality; and
the ratio of long-term membership attending a school other than the union
school to total long-term membership of the member municipality. Total long-
term membership of the member municipality is based on the number of pupils
who are legal residents of the municipality and attending school at public
expense. If necessary, the Commissioner may adopt a rule to clarify and

Secretary of Education by the supplemental district spending yield. The
legislative body in each member municipality shall then bill each property
taxpayer at the rate determined by the Commissioner under this subsection,
divided by the number resulting from dividing the municipality’s most recent
common level of appraisal by the statewide adjustment and multiplied by the
current grand list value of the property to be taxed. The bill shall show the tax
due and the calculation of the rate.

subsection shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes
assessed under chapter 133 of this title with no tax classification other than as
homestead or nonhomestead property; provided, however, that the tax levied

cooperative declared as a homestead may only include the homestead and a pro
rata share of any common land owned or leased by the cooperative, not to
exceed the two-acre housesite limitation. The share of the cooperative’s
assessed value attributable to the housesite shall be determined by the
cooperative and specified annually in a notice to the co-op member. Property
taxes paid by a mobile home park cooperative, allocable to property used as a
housesite, shall be attributed to the owner of the housesite for the purpose of

allocated amount as property tax paid on the land with the amount of property
taxes paid by the homeowner on the home for the purposes of computation of
the credit property tax liability under this section. The allocated amount shall
be determined by the nonprofit corporation or community land trust on a
proportional basis. The nonprofit corporation or community land trust shall
provide to that homeowner, by January 31, a certificate specifying the
allocated amount. The certificate shall indicate the proportion of total property
tax on the parcel that was assessed for municipal property tax and for statewide
property tax and the proportion of total value of the parcel. A homeowner
under this subsection shall be entitled to a property tax credit in an amount
determined by multiplying the property taxes allocated under this subsection
by the percentage of the exemption for which the homeowner’s household
income qualifies under subdivision (a)(1) of this section.
(h) A homestead owner shall be entitled to an additional property tax credit
amount equal to one percent of the amount of income tax refund that the
claimant elects to allocate to payment of homestead statewide education
property tax under section 6068 of this title.

§ 6066a. DETERMINATION OF HOMESTEAD PROPERTY TAX
EXEMPTION AND MUNICIPAL PROPERTY TAX CREDIT
VT LEG #384389 v.1

No. 73 Page 120 of 147
2025
(a) Annually, the Commissioner shall determine the homestead property
tax exemption and the municipal property tax credit amount under section
6066 of this title, related to a homestead owned by the claimant, based on the
prior taxable year’s income and for the municipal property tax credit, crediting
property taxes paid in the prior year, and for the homestead property tax
exemption, exempting the housesite value in the claim year. The
Commissioner shall notify the municipality in which the housesite is located of
the amount of the homestead property tax exemption and municipal property
tax credit for the claimant for homestead property tax liabilities on a monthly
basis. The municipal property tax credit of a claimant who was assessed
property tax by a town that revised the dates of its fiscal year, however, is the
excess of the property tax that was assessed in the last 12 months of the revised
fiscal year, over the adjusted property tax of the claimant for the revised fiscal
year, as determined under section 6066 of this title, related to a homestead
owned by the claimant.
(b) The Commissioner shall include in the total homestead property tax
exemption and municipal property tax credit amount determined under
subsection (a) of this section, for credit to the taxpayer for homestead statewide
education property tax and supplemental district spending tax liabilities, any
income tax overpayment remaining after allocation under section 3112 of this
title and setoff under section 5934 of this title, which the taxpayer has directed
to be used for payment of property taxes.
VT LEG #384389 v.1

No. 73 Page 121 of 147
2025
(c) The Commissioner shall notify the municipality of any claim and
refund amounts unresolved by November 1 at the time of final resolution,
including adjudication, if any; provided, however, that towns will not be
notified of any additional credit amounts after November 1 of the claim year,
and such amounts shall be paid to the claimant by the Commissioner.
(d) [Repealed.]
(e) At the time of notice to the municipality, the Commissioner shall notify
the taxpayer of the homestead property tax credit exemption amount
determined under subdivision 6066(a)(1) of this title, the amount determined
under subdivision 6066(a)(3) of this title,; any additional municipal property
credit amounts amount due the homestead owner under section subdivision
6066(a)(2) of this title,; the amount of income tax refund, if any, allocated to
payment of homestead statewide education property tax liabilities,; and any
late-claim reduction amount.
(f)(1) For taxpayers and amounts stated in the notice to towns on or before
July 1, municipalities shall create and send to taxpayers a homestead property
tax bill, instead of the bill required under subdivision 5402(b)(1) of this title,
providing the total amount allocated to payment of homestead statewide
education property tax liabilities and notice of the balance due. Municipalities
shall apply the amount of the homestead property tax exemption allocated
under this chapter to current year property taxes in equal amounts to each of
the taxpayers’ property tax installments that include education taxes and the
VT LEG #384389 v.1

No. 73 Page 122 of 147
2025
amount of the municipal property tax credit allocated under this chapter to
current year municipal property taxes in equal amounts to each of the
taxpayers’ property tax installments that include municipal taxes.
Notwithstanding section 4772 of this title, if a town issues a corrected bill as a
result of the notice sent by the Commissioner under subsection (a) of this
section, issuance of the corrected new bill does not extend the time for
payment of the original bill nor relieve the taxpayer of any interest or penalties
associated with the original bill. If the corrected bill is less than the original
bill, and there are also no unpaid current year taxes, interest, or penalties, and
no past year delinquent taxes or penalties and interest charges, any
overpayment shall be reflected on the corrected tax bill and refunded to the
taxpayer.
(2) For homestead property tax exemption and municipal property tax
credit amounts for which municipalities receive notice after November 1,
municipalities shall issue a new homestead property tax bill with notice to the
taxpayer of the total amount allocated to payment of homestead property tax
liabilities and notice of the balance due.
(3) The homestead property tax exemption and municipal property tax
credit amount determined for the taxpayer shall be allocated first to current
year housesite value and property tax on the homestead parcel, next to current-
year homestead parcel penalties and interest, next to any prior year homestead
parcel penalties and interest, and last to any prior year housesite value and
VT LEG #384389 v.1

No. 73 Page 123 of 147
2025
property tax on the homestead parcel. No homestead property tax exemption
or municipal credit shall be allocated to a housesite value or property tax
liability for any year after the year for which the claim or refund allocation was
filed. No municipal tax-reduction incentive for early payment of taxes shall
apply to any amount allocated to the property tax bill under this chapter.
(4) If the homestead property tax exemption or the municipal property
tax credit amount as described in subsection (e) of this section exceeds the
property tax, penalties, and interest due for the current and all prior years, the
municipality shall refund the excess to the taxpayer, without interest, within 20
days of the first date upon which taxes become due and payable or 20 days
after notification of the exemption or credit amount by the Commissioner of
Taxes, whichever is later.
(g) The Commissioner of Taxes shall pay monthly to each municipality the
amount of municipal property tax credit of which the municipality was last
notified related to municipal property tax on homesteads within that
municipality, as determined by the Commissioner of Taxes.
§ 6067. CREDIT CLAIM LIMITATIONS

Sec. 65. 32 V.S.A. § 6066a(f)(1) is amended to read:
(f)(1) For taxpayers and amounts stated in the notice to towns on or before
July 1, municipalities shall create and send to taxpayers a homestead property
tax bill, instead of the bill required under subdivision 5402(b)(1) of this title,
providing the total amount allocated to payment of homestead education
property tax liabilities and notice of the balance due. Nothing in this
VT LEG #384389 v.1

No. 73 Page 140 of 147
2025
subdivision, however, shall be interpreted as altering the requirement under
subdivision 5402(b)(2) of this title that the statewide education homestead tax
be billed in a manner that is stated clearly and separately from any other tax.
Municipalities shall apply the amount allocated under this chapter to current
year property taxes in equal amounts to each of the taxpayers’ property tax
installments that include education taxes. Notwithstanding section 4772 of this
title, if a town issues a corrected bill as a result of the notice sent by the
Commissioner under subsection (a) of this section, issuance of the corrected
new bill does not extend the time for payment of the original bill nor relieve
the taxpayer of any interest or penalties associated with the original bill. If the
corrected bill is less than the original bill, and there are also no unpaid current
year taxes, interest, or penalties, and no past year delinquent taxes or penalties
and interest charges, any overpayment shall be reflected on the corrected tax
bill and refunded to the taxpayer.
Sec. 66. 32 V.S.A. § 5252 is amended to read:

for collection a tax assessed against real estate in the town and the taxpayer
owes a minimum of $1,500.00 and is delinquent for a period longer than one
year, the collector may extend a warrant on such land. However, no warrant
shall be extended until a delinquent taxpayer is given an opportunity to enter a
written reasonable repayment plan pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. If
VT LEG #384389 v.1

No. 73 Page 141 of 147
2025
a collector receives notice from a mobile home park owner pursuant to 10
V.S.A. § 6248(b), the collector shall, within 15 days after the notice,
commence tax sale proceedings to hold a tax sale within 60 days after the
notice. If the collector fails to initiate such proceedings, the town may initiate
tax sale proceedings only after complying with 10 V.S.A. § 6249(f). If the tax
collector extends the warrant, the collector shall:

When an appeal to the Director is not withdrawn or forwarded by the
Director to Superior Court pursuant to subsection 4461(a) of this title, the
Director shall refer the appeal in writing to a person not employed by the
Director, appointed by the Director as hearing officer. The Director shall have
the right to remove a hearing officer for inefficiency, malfeasance in office, or
other cause. In like manner, the Director shall appoint a hearing officer to fill
any vacancy created by resignation, removal, or other cause. Before entering
into their duties, persons appointed as hearing officers shall take and subscribe
the oath of the office prescribed in the Constitution, which oath shall be filed
with the Director. The Director Commissioner of Taxes shall pay each hearing
officer a sum not to exceed $150.00 per diem for each day wherein hearings
are held $38.00 per hour plus a cost-of-living adjustment in an amount equal to
VT LEG #384389 v.1

No. 73 Page 142 of 147
2025
any adjustment approved for exempt employees by the Secretary of
Administration, together with reasonable expenses as the Director
Commissioner may determine. A hearing officer may subpoena witnesses,
records, and documents in the manner provided by law for serving subpoenas
in civil actions and may administer oaths to witnesses.
Sec. 68. 32 V.S.A. § 5402(c)(2) is amended to read:
(2) The Secretary of Education shall determine each municipality’s net
nonhomestead education tax payment and its net homestead education tax
payment to the State based on grand list information received by the Secretary
not later than the March 15 prior to the June 1 net payment. Payment shall be
accompanied by a return prescribed by the Secretary of Education. Each
municipality may retain 0.225 of one percent of the total education tax
collected, only upon timely remittance of net payment to the State Treasurer or
to the applicable school district or districts. Each municipality may also retain
$15.00 for each late property tax credit claim filed after April 15 and before
September 2, as notified by the Department of Taxes, for the cost of issuing a
new property tax bill.
