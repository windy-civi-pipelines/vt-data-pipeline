4 The Senate proposes to the House to amend the bill by striking out all after
5 the enacting clause and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
6 * * * Findings and Intent * * *
7 Sec. 1. FINDINGS; INTENT; PLAN
8 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
9 (1) In 1997, the first piece of law the General Assembly enacted in
10 response to the Brigham decision stated, “[t]he right to public education is
11 integral to Vermont’s constitutional form of government and its guarantees of
12 political and civil rights…[and] fundamental for the success of Vermont’s
13 children in a rapidly-changing society and global marketplace as well as the
14 State’s own economic and social prosperity.” 16 V.S.A. § 1.
15 (2) From the very first attempt at creating a basic frame of government,
16 Vermont’s founders chose to include a right to public education, the only
17 governmental service included in Vermont’s first Constitution of 1777.
18 (3) As the U.S. Supreme Court stated in Brown v. Board of Education,
19 347 U.S. 483 (1954), “education is perhaps the most important function of
20 state and local governments…[i]t is required in the performance of our most
21 basic public responsibilities…[i]t is the very foundation of good citizenship.”
VT LEG #383865 v.1
SENATE PROPOSAL OF AMENDMENT H.454

1 (4) The most enduring legacy of Brigham v. State, 166 Vt. 246 (1997) is
2 the State’s responsibility to ensure substantially equal educational
3 opportunities for all Vermont students.
4 (5) The education system is still reeling from the effects of a global
5 pandemic, yet the same challenges that have faced Vermont’s education
6 system remain. Thirty to 40 years ago, Vermont educated more than 110,000
7 students each year. Today, there are approximately 84,000 students in the
8 public education system. Many schools have lost a significant number of
9 students and, with them, the ability to offer robust services and programs at
10 every school. Vermont’s youth need to be prepared for a rapidly evolving
11 future.
12 (6) Vermonters deserve an exceptional educational system that is stable
13 and predictable and where a student’s home address does not dictate the
14 quality of education they receive. School district size and boundaries, school
15 size, and class size are all influential factors in shaping the quality of
16 instruction and overall student outcomes. The effectiveness of our schools
17 depends on teacher quality, resource availability, and the unique strengths of
18 local communities. Change in our educational system is needed. Systems are
19 made of people, so change must come carefully and thoughtfully, with
20 meaningful engagement by all Vermonters.

1 (b) Intent; plan.
2 (1) To ensure each student is provided substantially equal educational
3 opportunities that will prepare them to thrive in a 21st-century world, it is the
4 intent of the General Assembly to work strategically, intentionally, and
5 thoughtfully to ensure that each incremental change made to Vermont’s public
6 education system provides strength and support to its only constitutionally
7 required governmental service.
8 (2) It is further the intent of the General Assembly to:
9 (A) in the 2026 session:
10 (i) enact new, larger school district boundaries that would be
11 effective July 1, 2027;
12 (ii) enact updates to career and technical education governance
13 systems, both at the local and statewide levels, that are reflective of the larger
14 public education governance transformation to new, larger school districts; and
15 (iii) create a coordinated and coherent statewide strategy for career
16 and technical education that is responsive to students and the State’s workforce
17 needs and that provides opportunities for more integration between career and
18 technical education and traditional high school work;
19 (B) provide or enable the provision of the necessary staffing,
20 resources, and support to the Agency of Education, the Secretary of State’s
21 Office, town clerks, and other integral parties to the election system to hold the
VT LEG #383865 v.1
SENATE PROPOSAL OF AMENDMENT H.454
2025 Page 4 of 144
1 first school board member elections within the newly created school districts in
2 a special election in March 2028; and
3 (C) provide or enable the provision of the necessary staffing,
4 resources, and support to the Agency of Education, State Board of Education,
5 and other integral parties to ensure that the necessary guidance and funding is
6 in place to allow for a smooth and successful transition between the operation
7 of Vermont’s current 119 school districts to the new, larger school districts,
8 with new school districts assuming responsibility for the education of all
9 resident students on July 1, 2029.
10 * * * Commission on the Future of Public Education * * *

13 school has either unreasonably refused to remedy the problem or its efforts
14 have proved ineffective, he or she the Secretary may recommend to the State
15 Board one or more of the actions listed in subsection (b) of this section. The

SENATE PROPOSAL OF AMENDMENT H.454
2025 Page 1 of 144
1 H.454
2 An act relating to transforming Vermont’s education governance, quality,
3 and finance systems
4 The Senate proposes to the House to amend the bill by striking out all after
5 the enacting clause and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
6 * * * Findings and Intent * * *
7 Sec. 1. FINDINGS; INTENT; PLAN
8 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
9 (1) In 1997, the first piece of law the General Assembly enacted in
10 response to the Brigham decision stated, “[t]he right to public education is
11 integral to Vermont’s constitutional form of government and its guarantees of
12 political and civil rights…[and] fundamental for the success of Vermont’s
13 children in a rapidly-changing society and global marketplace as well as the
14 State’s own economic and social prosperity.” 16 V.S.A. § 1.
15 (2) From the very first attempt at creating a basic frame of government,
16 Vermont’s founders chose to include a right to public education, the only
17 governmental service included in Vermont’s first Constitution of 1777.
18 (3) As the U.S. Supreme Court stated in Brown v. Board of Education,
19 347 U.S. 483 (1954), “education is perhaps the most important function of
20 state and local governments…[i]t is required in the performance of our most
21 basic public responsibilities…[i]t is the very foundation of good citizenship.”
VT LEG #383865 v.1

SENATE PROPOSAL OF AMENDMENT H.454
2025 Page 2 of 144
1 (4) The most enduring legacy of Brigham v. State, 166 Vt. 246 (1997) is
2 the State’s responsibility to ensure substantially equal educational
3 opportunities for all Vermont students.
4 (5) The education system is still reeling from the effects of a global
5 pandemic, yet the same challenges that have faced Vermont’s education
6 system remain. Thirty to 40 years ago, Vermont educated more than 110,000
7 students each year. Today, there are approximately 84,000 students in the
8 public education system. Many schools have lost a significant number of
9 students and, with them, the ability to offer robust services and programs at
10 every school. Vermont’s youth need to be prepared for a rapidly evolving
11 future.
12 (6) Vermonters deserve an exceptional educational system that is stable
13 and predictable and where a student’s home address does not dictate the
14 quality of education they receive. School district size and boundaries, school
15 size, and class size are all influential factors in shaping the quality of
16 instruction and overall student outcomes. The effectiveness of our schools
17 depends on teacher quality, resource availability, and the unique strengths of
18 local communities. Change in our educational system is needed. Systems are
19 made of people, so change must come carefully and thoughtfully, with
20 meaningful engagement by all Vermonters.

1 (b) Intent; plan.
2 (1) To ensure each student is provided substantially equal educational

5 need to provide students attending the school substantially equal educational
6 opportunities. A school board aggrieved by an order of the State Board may
7 appeal the order in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure.
8 * * *
9 (e) If the Secretary determines at any time that the failure of a school to
10 meet the education quality standards listed in subsection (a) of this section is
11 severe or pervasive, potentially results in physical or emotional harm to
12 students or significant deprivation of equal education opportunities, and the
13 school has either unreasonably refused to remedy the problem or its efforts
14 have proved ineffective, he or she the Secretary may recommend to the State
15 Board one or more of the actions listed in subsection (b) of this section. The
16 State Board shall then follow the procedure of subsection (c) of this section.

8 district consolidation or school consolidation if a school fails to comply with
9 class size minimum education quality standards and the resulting consolidation
10 would result in school construction costs in excess of the applicable district’s
11 capital reserve account until the General Assembly establishes new school
12 district boundaries and takes further action regarding the consequences for
13 failure to meet education quality standards.

11 (b) Report. On or before December 1, 2025, the State Board of Education
12 shall submit a written report to the House and Senate Committees on

4 bill, and there are also no unpaid current year taxes, interest, or penalties, and
5 no past year delinquent taxes or penalties and interest charges, any
6 overpayment shall be reflected on the corrected tax bill and refunded to the
7 taxpayer.

10 municipalities shall issue a new homestead property tax bill with notice to the
11 taxpayer of the total amount allocated to payment of homestead property tax
12 liabilities and notice of the balance due.
13 (3) The homestead property tax exemption and municipal property tax
14 credit amount determined for the taxpayer shall be allocated first to current

17 parcel penalties and interest, and last to any prior year housesite value and
18 property tax on the homestead parcel. No homestead property tax exemption
19 or municipal credit shall be allocated to a housesite value or property tax
20 liability for any year after the year for which the claim or refund allocation was

7 days of the first date upon which taxes become due and payable or 20 days
