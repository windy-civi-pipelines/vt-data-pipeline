2 An act relating to transforming Vermont’s education governance, quality,
3 and finance systems
4 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
5 * * * Findings and Intent * * *
6 Sec. 1. FINDINGS; INTENT; PLAN
7 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
8 (1) In 1997, the first piece of law the General Assembly enacted in
9 response to Brigham v. State, 166 Vt. 246 (1997) stated, “[t]he right to public
10 education is integral to Vermont’s constitutional form of government and its
11 guarantees of political and civil rights…[and] fundamental for the success of
12 Vermont’s children in a rapidly-changing society and global marketplace as
13 well as the State’s own economic and social prosperity.” 16 V.S.A. § 1.
14 (2) From the very first attempt at creating a basic frame of government,
15 Vermont’s founders chose to include a right to public education, the only
16 governmental service included in Vermont’s first Constitution of 1777.
17 (3) As the U.S. Supreme Court stated in Brown v. Board of Education,
18 347 U.S. 483 (1954), “education is perhaps the most important function of
19 state and local governments…[i]t is required in the performance of our most
20 basic public responsibilities…[i]t is the very foundation of good citizenship.”
21 (4) The most enduring legacy of Brigham is the State’s responsibility to
22 ensure substantially equal educational opportunities for all Vermont students.
VT LEG #384279 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.454
2025 Page 2 of 154
1 (5) The education system is still reeling from the effects of a global
2 pandemic, yet the same challenges that have faced Vermont’s education
3 system remain. Thirty to 40 years ago, Vermont educated more than 110,000
4 students each year. Today, there are approximately 84,000 students in the
5 public education system. Many schools have lost a significant number of
6 students and, with them, the ability to offer robust services and programs at
7 every school. Vermont’s youth need to be prepared for a rapidly evolving
8 future.
9 (6) Vermonters deserve an exceptional educational system that is stable
10 and predictable and where a student’s home address does not dictate the
11 quality of education they receive. School district size and boundaries, school
12 size, and class size are all influential factors in shaping the quality of
13 instruction and overall student outcomes. The effectiveness of our schools
14 depends on teacher quality, resource availability, and the unique strengths of
15 local communities. Change in our educational system is needed. Systems are
16 made of people, so change must come carefully and thoughtfully, with
17 meaningful engagement by all Vermonters.
18 (b) Intent; plan.
19 (1) To ensure each student is provided substantially equal educational
20 opportunities that will prepare them to thrive in a 21st-century world, it is the
21 intent of the General Assembly to work strategically, intentionally, and
VT LEG #384279 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.454
2025 Page 3 of 154
1 thoughtfully to ensure that each incremental change made to Vermont’s public
2 education system provides strength and support to its only constitutionally
3 required governmental service.
4 (2) It is further the intent of the General Assembly to:
5 (A) in the 2026 session:
6 (i) enact new, larger school district boundaries that would be
7 effective July 1, 2026;
8 (ii) enact updates to career and technical education governance
9 systems, both at the local and statewide levels, that are reflective of the larger
10 public education governance transformation to new, larger school districts;
11 (iii) create a coordinated and coherent statewide strategy for career
12 and technical education that is responsive to students and the State’s workforce
13 needs and that provides opportunities for more integration between career and
14 technical education and traditional high school work;
15 (iv) enact student-centered updates to fully fund career and
16 technical education within a foundation formula that does not create
17 competition between sending schools and career and technical education
18 programs for available funds nor exceed current spending levels;
19 (v) begin the process to create voting wards within each school
20 district to ensure school board membership is apportioned in such a manner as
VT LEG #384279 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.454
2025 Page 4 of 154
1 to achieve substantially equal weighting of the votes of all voters in the
2 election of school board members; and
3 (vi) establish an appropriate weight for prekindergarten students,
4 as well as enact changes to the publicly funded prekindergarten program that
5 ensure costs are borne by the appropriate funding source depending on the age
6 of the student and the prekindergarten education provider;
7 (B) provide or enable the provision of the necessary staffing,
8 resources, and support to the Agency of Education, the Secretary of State’s
9 Office, town clerks, and other integral parties to the election system to hold the
10 first school board member elections within the newly created school districts in
11 a special election in November 2027; and
12 (C) provide or enable the provision of the necessary staffing,
13 resources, and support to the Agency of Education, State Board of Education,
14 and other integral parties to ensure that the necessary guidance and funding is
15 in place to allow for a smooth and successful transition between the operation
16 of Vermont’s current 119 school districts to the new, larger school districts,
17 with new school districts assuming responsibility for the education of all
18 resident students on July 1, 2028.
19 (3) It is further the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that the
20 imposition of the new statewide education tax rate contemplated by this act
21 does not result in an increase of education property tax bills relative to
VT LEG #384279 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.454
2025 Page 5 of 154
1 Vermont’s current education funding system for municipalities across
2 Vermont. The General Assembly intends to mitigate or reduce property tax
3 bills for Vermonters by, among other things:
4 (A) enacting new school district boundaries that increase the
5 efficiency of the delivery of educational services through scale;
6 (B) addressing inefficiencies of education delivery through
7 programmatic updates to prekindergarten, career and technical education, and
8 special education;
9 (C) improving staffing ratios to increase sustainability and reduce
10 costs;
11 (D) addressing high-cost, languishing physical school infrastructure
12 through implementation of a new State aid for school construction program;
13 (E) evaluating and consolidating education governance structures to
14 reduce administrative costs and burdens;
15 (F) stabilizing education property taxes by transitioning from an
16 education funding system that funds locally varying budgets to a foundation
17 formula that funds predictable educational opportunity payments;
18 (G) implementing a foundation formula with costs reflective of the
19 most efficient method of delivery of education services to Vermont pupils of
20 all educational needs within Vermont’s existing education structure;
VT LEG #384279 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.454
2025 Page 6 of 154
1 (H) providing a process for regular recalibration of the foundation
2 formula to reduce costs over time as educational efficiencies are gained
3 through the implementation of new governance and programmatic structures;
4 (I) reserving support for small and sparse schools for schools that are
5 small or sparse by necessity;
6 (J) shifting certain education and other related costs off of the
7 Education Fund and on to other sources of funding that do not impact the
8 property tax bills of Vermonters;
9 (K) implementing equalizing measures for any local spending
10 additional to educational opportunity payments that reserve funds within the
11 Education Fund to reduce following-year property tax bills;
12 (L) imposing a cap on local spending additional to educational
13 opportunity payments to limit property tax rate increases through the
14 supplemental district spending tax;
15 (M) providing transitionary measures to ease school district
16 movement from current education spending to educational opportunity
17 payments under the new foundation formula; and
18 (N) replacing the existing property tax credit with a homestead
19 exemption that increases income sensitivity benefits to Vermonters with low
20 and moderate income and smooths existing income sensitivity benefit cliffs.

4 Sec. 6. 16 V.S.A. § 165 is amended to read:
5 § 165. EDUCATION QUALITY STANDARDS; EQUAL EDUCATIONAL
6 OPPORTUNITIES; INDEPENDENT SCHOOL MEETING
7 EDUCATION QUALITY STANDARDS
8 (a) In order to carry out Vermont’s policy that all Vermont children will be
9 afforded educational opportunities that are substantially equal in quality, each
10 Vermont public school, including each career technical center, shall meet the
11 following education quality standards:
12 * * *
13 (9) The school complies with average class size minimum standards;
14 provided, however, that when class size minimums apply to content areas, an
15 individual class may be smaller than the minimum average. As used in this
16 subdivision, “content area” means a group of courses within a specific
17 licensing endorsement area.
18 (A) Class size standards.
19 (i) The average class size minimum for first-grade classes shall be
20 10 students.
VT LEG #384279 v.1

16 (vii) Class sizes shall not exceed the maximum occupancy limits
17 established by local and State fire codes, including egress and safety

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.454
2025 Page 31 of 154
1 meet the standards contained in this subdivision (9) that may include
2 consolidation or merger, the school board may ask the State Board of
3 Education to grant it waiver from this subdivision (9). The State Board shall
4 define what qualifies as geographic isolation in its rules adopted pursuant to
5 subdivision (a)(3) of this section. The State Board’s decision shall be final.
6 (C) State Board action. If the Secretary determines that a school is
7 not meeting the class size minimum standards set forth in this subdivision (9)
8 over the course of three consecutive school years, the Secretary may
9 recommend to the State Board one or more of the actions listed in subsection
10 (b) of this section, regardless of whether the school is meeting all other
11 education quality standards. The State Board shall then follow the procedure
12 of subsection (c) of this section.
13 (b) Annually, the Secretary shall determine whether students in each
14 Vermont public school are provided educational opportunities substantially
15 equal to those provided in other public schools. If the Secretary determines
16 that a school is not meeting the education quality standards listed in subsection
17 (a) of this section or that the school is making insufficient progress in
18 improving student performance in relation to the standards for student
19 performance set forth in subdivision 164(9) of this title, he or she the Secretary
20 shall describe in writing actions that a district must take in order to meet either
21 or both sets of standards and shall provide technical assistance to the school. If
VT LEG #384279 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.454
2025 Page 32 of 154
1 the school fails to meet the standards or make sufficient progress within two
2 years of following the determination, the Secretary shall recommend to the
3 State Board one or more of the following actions:
4 (1) the Agency continue to provide technical assistance for one more
5 cycle of review;
6 (2) the State Board adjust supervisory union boundaries or
7 responsibilities of the superintendency pursuant to section 261 of this title;
8 (3) the Secretary assume administrative control of an individual school,
9 school district, or supervisory union, including budgetary control to ensure
10 sound financial practices, only to the extent necessary to correct deficiencies;
11 (4) the State Board close an individual school or schools and require that
12 the school district pay tuition to another public school or an approved
13 independent school pursuant to chapter 21 of this title; or
14 (5) the State Board require two or more school districts to consolidate
15 their governance structures.
16 (c) The State Board, after offering the school board an opportunity for a
17 hearing, shall either dismiss the Secretary’s recommendation or order that one
18 or more of the actions listed in subsection (b) of this section be taken. The
19 action ordered by the State Board shall be the least intrusive consistent with the
20 need to provide students attending the school substantially equal educational

1 opportunities. A school board aggrieved by an order of the State Board may
2 appeal the order in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure.
3 * * *
4 (e) If the Secretary determines at any time that the failure of a school to
5 meet the education quality standards listed in subsection (a) of this section is
6 severe or pervasive, potentially results in physical or emotional harm to
7 students or significant deprivation of equal education opportunities, and the
8 school has either unreasonably refused to remedy the problem or its efforts
9 have proved ineffective, he or she the Secretary may recommend to the State
10 Board one or more of the actions listed in subsection (b) of this section. The

17 district consolidation or school consolidation if a school fails to comply with

15 owned by the claimant.

3 the taxpayers’ property tax installments that include education taxes and the
4 amount of the municipal property tax credit allocated under this chapter to
5 current year municipal property taxes in equal amounts to each of the
6 taxpayers’ property tax installments that include municipal taxes.
7 Notwithstanding section 4772 of this title, if a town issues a corrected bill as a
8 result of the notice sent by the Commissioner under subsection (a) of this
9 section, issuance of the corrected new bill does not extend the time for
10 payment of the original bill nor relieve the taxpayer of any interest or penalties
11 associated with the original bill. If the corrected bill is less than the original
12 bill, and there are also no unpaid current year taxes, interest, or penalties, and
13 no past year delinquent taxes or penalties and interest charges, any
14 overpayment shall be reflected on the corrected tax bill and refunded to the
15 taxpayer.
16 (2) For homestead property tax exemption and municipal property tax
17 credit amounts for which municipalities receive notice after November 1,
18 municipalities shall issue a new homestead property tax bill with notice to the
19 taxpayer of the total amount allocated to payment of homestead property tax
20 liabilities and notice of the balance due.

4 year homestead parcel penalties and interest, next to any prior year homestead
5 parcel penalties and interest, and last to any prior year housesite value and
6 property tax on the homestead parcel. No homestead property tax exemption
7 or municipal credit shall be allocated to a housesite value or property tax
8 liability for any year after the year for which the claim or refund allocation was
9 filed. No municipal tax-reduction incentive for early payment of taxes shall
10 apply to any amount allocated to the property tax bill under this chapter.
11 (4) If the homestead property tax exemption or the municipal property
12 tax credit amount as described in subsection (e) of this section exceeds the
13 property tax, penalties, and interest due for the current and all prior years, the

1 nonhomestead nonresidential, or a proportional classification of those uses.
2 The information collected, and classifications determined, shall align with the
3 definitions and requirements of Sec. 61 of this act. The Commissioner shall
4 use the information to determine and assign a tax classification for every grand
5 list parcel and, on or before October 1, 2027, the Commissioner shall provide
6 that information to the Joint Fiscal Office.
7 Sec. 61b. PROPERTY TAX CLASSIFICATIONS IMPLEMENTATION
8 REPORT
9 (a) The Commissioner of Taxes shall study the implementation of new
10 property tax classifications under this act and identify any further actions
11 required by the Department of Taxes, Vermont municipalities, and the General
12 Assembly to successfully implement the new tax classification system on the
13 timeline established by this act. The issues considered by the Commissioner
14 shall include any adjustments to the statutory definitions, any needed changes
15 to existing forms, whether new forms or taxpayer filings are needed, and how
16 the Department could identify parcels with dwelling units that do not have an
17 affiliated homestead declaration or landlord certificate on file.
18 (b) The Commissioner shall additionally recommend sets of tax rate
19 multipliers to be applied under 32 V.S.A. § 5402(a) as amended by this act.
20 (1) The Commissioner shall recommend a multiplier set that would
21 ensure any new revenue derived from the nonhomestead residential
VT LEG #384279 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.454
2025 Page 142 of 154
1 classification would cover the cost to the Education Fund caused by the
2 homestead property tax exemption under 32 V.S.A. § 6066(a) as amended by
3 this act.
4 (2) The Commissioner shall recommend a different multiplier set that
5 would ensure that any new revenue derived from the nonhomestead residential
6 classification would mitigate forecasted property tax increases on homestead
7 property taxpayers caused by the implementation of this act.
8 (c) On or before December 15, 2025, the Commissioner of Taxes shall
9 submit a study report detailing the Commissioner’s findings under this section
10 to the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on
11 Finance.
12 Sec. 61c. TAX CLASSIFICATIONS; RATE MULTIPLIERS; INTENT
13 It is the intent of the General Assembly that the creation of a tax
14 classification system, and the specific tax classifications to be used by that
15 system, will be reevaluated at the same time as any further amendment of the
16 tax rate multipliers created under 32 V.S.A. § 6066(a) as amended by this act.
17 Sec. 61d. PROSPECTIVE REPEAL OF TAX CLASSIFICATIONS
18 In order to ensure successful implementation of education finance reform as
19 set forth in this act, in the absence of legislative action on or before July 1,
20 2028 that creates a new tax rate multiplier to be used in a tax classification
21 system, subdivision (f)(10) of Sec. 70 of this act is repealed on July 1, 2028.
