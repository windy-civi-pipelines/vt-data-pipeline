4 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
5 * * * Findings and Intent * * *
6 Sec. 1. FINDINGS; INTENT; PLAN
7 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
8 (1) In 1997, the first piece of law the General Assembly enacted in
9 response to the Brigham decision stated, “[t]he right to public education is
10 integral to Vermont’s constitutional form of government and its guarantees of
11 political and civil rights…[and] fundamental for the success of Vermont’s
12 children in a rapidly-changing society and global marketplace as well as the
13 State’s own economic and social prosperity.” 16 V.S.A. § 1.
14 (2) From the very first attempt at creating a basic frame of government,
15 Vermont’s founders chose to include a right to public education, the only
16 governmental service included in Vermont’s first Constitution of 1777.
17 (3) As the U.S. Supreme Court stated in Brown v. Board of Education,
18 347 U.S. 483 (1954), “education is perhaps the most important function of
19 state and local governments…[i]t is required in the performance of our most
20 basic public responsibilities…[i]t is the very foundation of good citizenship.”
VT LEG #382657 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 2 of 160
1 (4) The most enduring legacy of Brigham v. State, 166 Vt. 246 (1997) is
2 the State’s responsibility to ensure substantially equal educational
3 opportunities for all Vermont students.
4 (5) The education system is still reeling from the effects of a global
5 pandemic, yet the same challenges that have faced Vermont’s education
6 system remain. Thirty to 40 years ago, Vermont educated more than 110,000
7 students each year. Today, there are approximately 84,000 students in the
8 public education system. Many schools have lost a significant number of
9 students and, with them, the ability to offer robust services and programs at
10 every school. Vermont’s youth need to be prepared for a rapidly evolving
11 future.
12 (6) Vermonters deserve an exceptional educational system that is stable
13 and predictable and where a student’s home address does not dictate the
14 quality of education they receive. School district size and boundaries, school
15 size, and class size are all influential factors in shaping the quality of
16 instruction and overall student outcomes. The effectiveness of our schools
17 depends on teacher quality, resource availability, and the unique strengths of
18 local communities. Change in our educational system is needed. Systems are
19 made of people, so change must come carefully and thoughtfully, with
20 meaningful engagement by all Vermonters.
21 (b) Intent; plan.
VT LEG #382657 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.454

1 (1) To ensure each student is provided substantially equal educational
2 opportunities that will prepare them to thrive in a 21st-century world, it is the
3 intent of the General Assembly to work strategically, intentionally, and
4 thoughtfully to ensure that each incremental change made to Vermont’s public
5 education system provides strength and support to its only constitutionally
6 required governmental service.
7 (2) It is further the intent of the General Assembly to:
8 (A) in the 2026 session:
9 (i) enact new, larger school district boundaries that would be
10 effective July 1, 2027;
11 (ii) enact updates to career and technical education governance
12 systems, both at the local and statewide levels, that are reflective of the larger
13 public education governance transformation to new, larger school districts;
14 (iii) create a coordinated and coherent statewide strategy for career
15 and technical education that is responsive to students and the State’s workforce
16 needs and that provides opportunities for more integration between career and
17 technical education and traditional high school work;
18 (iv) enact student-centered updates to career and technical
19 education funding within a foundation formula that does not create competition
20 between sending schools and career and technical education programs for
21 available funds; and
VT LEG #382657 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 4 of 160
1 (v) begin the process to create voting wards within each school
2 district to ensure school board membership is apportioned in such a manner as
3 to achieve substantially equal weighting of the votes of all voters in the
4 election of school board members;
5 (B) provide or enable the provision of the necessary staffing,
6 resources, and support to the Agency of Education, the Secretary of State’s
7 Office, town clerks, and other integral parties to the election system to hold the
8 first school board member elections within the newly created school districts in
9 a special election in March 2028; and
10 (C) provide or enable the provision of the necessary staffing,
11 resources, and support to the Agency of Education, State Board of Education,
12 and other integral parties to ensure that the necessary guidance and funding is
13 in place to allow for a smooth and successful transition between the operation
14 of Vermont’s current 119 school districts to the new, larger school districts,
15 with new school districts assuming responsibility for the education of all
16 resident students on July 1, 2029.

VT LEG #382657 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 25 of 160
1 (9) The school complies with average class size minimum standards;
2 provided, however, that when class size minimums apply to content areas, an
3 individual class may be smaller than the minimum average. As used in this

1 (vi) Class sizes shall not exceed the maximum occupancy limits
2 established by local and State fire codes, including egress and safety
3 requirements.
4 (B) Waivers. If a school board determines that it operates a school
5 that is unable to comply with the class size minimum standards due to
6 geographic isolation, or a school has developed an implementation plan to
7 meet the standards contained in this subdivision (9) that may include
8 consolidation or merger, the school board may ask the State Board of
9 Education to grant it waiver from this subdivision (9). The State Board shall
10 define what qualifies as geographic isolation in its rules adopted pursuant to
11 subdivision (a)(3) of this section. The State Board’s decision shall be final.
12 (C) State Board action. If the Secretary determines that a school is
13 not meeting the class size minimum standards set forth in this subdivision (9)
14 over the course of two consecutive school years, the Secretary shall
15 recommend to the State Board one or more of the actions listed in subsection
16 (b) of this section, regardless of whether the school is meeting all other
17 education quality standards. The State Board shall then follow the procedure
18 of subsection (c) of this section.
19 (b) Annually, the Secretary shall determine whether students in each
20 Vermont public school are provided educational opportunities substantially
21 equal to those provided in other public schools. If the Secretary determines
VT LEG #382657 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 27 of 160
1 that a school is not meeting the education quality standards listed in subsection
2 (a) of this section or that the school is making insufficient progress in
3 improving student performance in relation to the standards for student
4 performance set forth in subdivision 164(9) of this title, he or she the Secretary
5 shall describe in writing actions that a district must take in order to meet either
6 or both sets of standards and shall provide technical assistance to the school. If
7 the school fails to meet the standards or make sufficient progress within two
8 years of following the determination, the Secretary shall recommend to the
9 State Board one or more of the following actions:
10 (1) the Agency continue to provide technical assistance for one more
11 cycle of review;
12 (2) the State Board adjust supervisory union boundaries or
13 responsibilities of the superintendency pursuant to section 261 of this title;

16 sound financial practices, only to the extent necessary to correct deficiencies;
17 (4) the State Board close an individual school or schools and require that
18 the school district pay tuition to another public school or an approved
19 independent school pursuant to chapter 21 of this title; or
20 (5) the State Board require two or more school districts to consolidate
21 their governance structures.

1 (c) The State Board, after offering the school board an opportunity for a
2 hearing, shall either dismiss the Secretary’s recommendation or order that one
3 or more of the actions listed in subsection (b) of this section be taken. The
4 action ordered by the State Board shall be the least intrusive consistent with the
5 need to provide students attending the school substantially equal educational
6 opportunities. A school board aggrieved by an order of the State Board may
7 appeal the order in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure.
8 * * *
9 (e) If the Secretary determines at any time that the failure of a school to
10 meet the education quality standards listed in subsection (a) of this section is
11 severe or pervasive, potentially results in physical or emotional harm to
12 students or significant deprivation of equal education opportunities, and the
13 school has either unreasonably refused to remedy the problem or its efforts
14 have proved ineffective, he or she the Secretary may recommend to the State
15 Board one or more of the actions listed in subsection (b) of this section. The
16 State Board shall then follow the procedure of subsection (c) of this section.

5 STANDARDS; STATE BOARD ACTION
6 Notwithstanding 16 V.S.A. § 165(b)(4) and (5) and any other provision of
7 law to the contrary, the State Board shall be prohibited from ordering school
8 district consolidation or school consolidation if a school fails to comply with
9 class size minimum education quality standards and the resulting consolidation
10 would result in school construction costs in excess of the applicable district’s
11 capital reserve account until the General Assembly establishes new school
12 district boundaries and takes further action regarding the consequences for
13 failure to meet education quality standards.

1 (B) on or before July 1, 2027, to adopt standards for statewide
2 proficiency-based graduation requirements based on standards adopted by the
3 State Board and recommendations from the Agency of Education, which shall
4 take effect beginning in the 2027–2028 school year for the graduating class of
5 2031 and every graduating class thereafter.
6 (2) On or before August 1, 2026, the State Board of Education shall
7 initiate rulemaking to amend the approved independent school rule 2200 series,

10 intend to accept public tuition to comply with the class size minimum
11 standards set pursuant to 16 V.S.A. § 165(a)(9). The amendments shall also
12 create a process for review by the State Board for failure to meet the class size
13 minimum requirements and the corresponding actions the Board may take for
14 such noncompliance; provided, however, that the Board shall provide an
15 approved independent school a substantially similar opportunity to come into
16 compliance with class size minimum standards that it would provide to a
17 public school.
18 (b) Report. On or before December 1, 2025, the State Board of Education
19 shall submit a written report to the House and Senate Committees on
20 Education with proposed standards for schools to be deemed “small by

9 standards for quality for public schools, geographic accessibility, statewide
10 enrollment trends, and capacity and scale that support substantially equal
11 educational opportunities for all Vermont students.
12 Sec. 8. PROHIBITION ON SCHOOL CLOSURE AND TRANSITION TO
13 PAYING TUITION
14 Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a school district shall
15 be prohibited from closing an existing public school and then providing for the
16 education of its resident students by paying tuition for its students to attend a
17 public or approved independent school chosen by the parents of the district’s
18 students. If a school district that closes an existing public school is unable to
19 provide for the education of its affected resident students in a different school
20 or schools operated by the district, the school district shall provide for the
21 education of its resident students by designating three or fewer public schools

18 payment. As soon as reasonably possible after a school district budget is
19 approved by voters, the Secretary shall determine the per pupil education
20 spending for the next fiscal year for the school district. Per pupil education
21 spending shall equal a school district’s education spending divided by its

7 Commissioner shall notify the municipality in which the housesite is located of
8 the amount of the homestead property tax exemption and municipal property
9 tax credit for the claimant for homestead property tax liabilities on a monthly
10 basis. The municipal property tax credit of a claimant who was assessed
11 property tax by a town that revised the dates of its fiscal year, however, is the
12 excess of the property tax that was assessed in the last 12 months of the revised
13 fiscal year, over the adjusted property tax of the claimant for the revised fiscal
14 year, as determined under section 6066 of this title, related to a homestead
15 owned by the claimant.
16 (b) The Commissioner shall include in the total homestead property tax
17 exemption and municipal property tax credit amount determined under

4 refund amounts unresolved by November 1 at the time of final resolution,
5 including adjudication, if any; provided, however, that towns will not be
6 notified of any additional credit amounts after November 1 of the claim year,

12 under subdivision 6066(a)(3) of this title,; any additional municipal property
13 credit amounts amount due the homestead owner under section subdivision
14 6066(a)(2) of this title,; the amount of income tax refund, if any, allocated to
15 payment of homestead statewide education property tax liabilities,; and any
16 late-claim reduction amount.
17 (f)(1) For taxpayers and amounts stated in the notice to towns on or before
18 July 1, municipalities shall create and send to taxpayers a homestead property
19 tax bill, instead of the bill required under subdivision 5402(b)(1) of this title,
20 providing the total amount allocated to payment of homestead statewide
21 education property tax liabilities and notice of the balance due. Municipalities

3 the taxpayers’ property tax installments that include education taxes and the
4 amount of the municipal property tax credit allocated under this chapter to
5 current year municipal property taxes in equal amounts to each of the
6 taxpayers’ property tax installments that include municipal taxes.
7 Notwithstanding section 4772 of this title, if a town issues a corrected bill as a
8 result of the notice sent by the Commissioner under subsection (a) of this
9 section, issuance of the corrected new bill does not extend the time for
10 payment of the original bill nor relieve the taxpayer of any interest or penalties
11 associated with the original bill. If the corrected bill is less than the original
12 bill, and there are also no unpaid current year taxes, interest, or penalties, and
13 no past year delinquent taxes or penalties and interest charges, any
14 overpayment shall be reflected on the corrected tax bill and refunded to the
15 taxpayer.
16 (2) For homestead property tax exemption and municipal property tax
17 credit amounts for which municipalities receive notice after November 1,
18 municipalities shall issue a new homestead property tax bill with notice to the
19 taxpayer of the total amount allocated to payment of homestead property tax
20 liabilities and notice of the balance due.

4 year homestead parcel penalties and interest, next to any prior year homestead
5 parcel penalties and interest, and last to any prior year housesite value and
6 property tax on the homestead parcel. No homestead property tax exemption
7 or municipal credit shall be allocated to a housesite value or property tax
8 liability for any year after the year for which the claim or refund allocation was
9 filed. No municipal tax-reduction incentive for early payment of taxes shall
10 apply to any amount allocated to the property tax bill under this chapter.
11 (4) If the homestead property tax exemption or the municipal property
12 tax credit amount as described in subsection (e) of this section exceeds the
13 property tax, penalties, and interest due for the current and all prior years, the
14 municipality shall refund the excess to the taxpayer, without interest, within 20
15 days of the first date upon which taxes become due and payable or 20 days

AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 1 of 160
1 H.454
2 An act relating to transforming Vermont’s education governance, quality,
3 and finance systems
4 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
5 * * * Findings and Intent * * *
6 Sec. 1. FINDINGS; INTENT; PLAN
7 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
8 (1) In 1997, the first piece of law the General Assembly enacted in
9 response to the Brigham decision stated, “[t]he right to public education is
10 integral to Vermont’s constitutional form of government and its guarantees of
11 political and civil rights…[and] fundamental for the success of Vermont’s
12 children in a rapidly-changing society and global marketplace as well as the
13 State’s own economic and social prosperity.” 16 V.S.A. § 1.
14 (2) From the very first attempt at creating a basic frame of government,
15 Vermont’s founders chose to include a right to public education, the only
16 governmental service included in Vermont’s first Constitution of 1777.
17 (3) As the U.S. Supreme Court stated in Brown v. Board of Education,
18 347 U.S. 483 (1954), “education is perhaps the most important function of
19 state and local governments…[i]t is required in the performance of our most
20 basic public responsibilities…[i]t is the very foundation of good citizenship.”
VT LEG #382657 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 2 of 160
1 (4) The most enduring legacy of Brigham v. State, 166 Vt. 246 (1997) is
2 the State’s responsibility to ensure substantially equal educational
3 opportunities for all Vermont students.
4 (5) The education system is still reeling from the effects of a global
5 pandemic, yet the same challenges that have faced Vermont’s education
6 system remain. Thirty to 40 years ago, Vermont educated more than 110,000
7 students each year. Today, there are approximately 84,000 students in the
8 public education system. Many schools have lost a significant number of
9 students and, with them, the ability to offer robust services and programs at
10 every school. Vermont’s youth need to be prepared for a rapidly evolving
11 future.
12 (6) Vermonters deserve an exceptional educational system that is stable
13 and predictable and where a student’s home address does not dictate the
14 quality of education they receive. School district size and boundaries, school
15 size, and class size are all influential factors in shaping the quality of
16 instruction and overall student outcomes. The effectiveness of our schools
17 depends on teacher quality, resource availability, and the unique strengths of
18 local communities. Change in our educational system is needed. Systems are
19 made of people, so change must come carefully and thoughtfully, with
20 meaningful engagement by all Vermonters.
21 (b) Intent; plan.
VT LEG #382657 v.1

1 (1) To ensure each student is provided substantially equal educational
2 opportunities that will prepare them to thrive in a 21st-century world, it is the
3 intent of the General Assembly to work strategically, intentionally, and
4 thoughtfully to ensure that each incremental change made to Vermont’s public
5 education system provides strength and support to its only constitutionally
6 required governmental service.
7 (2) It is further the intent of the General Assembly to:
8 (A) in the 2026 session:
9 (i) enact new, larger school district boundaries that would be
10 effective July 1, 2027;
11 (ii) enact updates to career and technical education governance
12 systems, both at the local and statewide levels, that are reflective of the larger
13 public education governance transformation to new, larger school districts;
14 (iii) create a coordinated and coherent statewide strategy for career
15 and technical education that is responsive to students and the State’s workforce
16 needs and that provides opportunities for more integration between career and
17 technical education and traditional high school work;
18 (iv) enact student-centered updates to career and technical
19 education funding within a foundation formula that does not create competition
20 between sending schools and career and technical education programs for
21 available funds; and
VT LEG #382657 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.454
2025 Page 4 of 160
1 (v) begin the process to create voting wards within each school
2 district to ensure school board membership is apportioned in such a manner as
3 to achieve substantially equal weighting of the votes of all voters in the
4 election of school board members;
5 (B) provide or enable the provision of the necessary staffing,
6 resources, and support to the Agency of Education, the Secretary of State’s
7 Office, town clerks, and other integral parties to the election system to hold the
8 first school board member elections within the newly created school districts in
9 a special election in March 2028; and
10 (C) provide or enable the provision of the necessary staffing,
11 resources, and support to the Agency of Education, State Board of Education,
12 and other integral parties to ensure that the necessary guidance and funding is
13 in place to allow for a smooth and successful transition between the operation
14 of Vermont’s current 119 school districts to the new, larger school districts,
15 with new school districts assuming responsibility for the education of all
16 resident students on July 1, 2029.
17 * * * Commission on the Future of Public Education * * *

4 (B) Waivers. If a school board determines that it operates a school
5 that is unable to comply with the class size minimum standards due to
6 geographic isolation, or a school has developed an implementation plan to
7 meet the standards contained in this subdivision (9) that may include
8 consolidation or merger, the school board may ask the State Board of
9 Education to grant it waiver from this subdivision (9). The State Board shall

18 of subsection (c) of this section.
19 (b) Annually, the Secretary shall determine whether students in each
20 Vermont public school are provided educational opportunities substantially

1 that a school is not meeting the education quality standards listed in subsection
2 (a) of this section or that the school is making insufficient progress in

4 performance set forth in subdivision 164(9) of this title, he or she the Secretary
5 shall describe in writing actions that a district must take in order to meet either
6 or both sets of standards and shall provide technical assistance to the school. If
7 the school fails to meet the standards or make sufficient progress within two
8 years of following the determination, the Secretary shall recommend to the
9 State Board one or more of the following actions:

1 (c) The State Board, after offering the school board an opportunity for a
2 hearing, shall either dismiss the Secretary’s recommendation or order that one
3 or more of the actions listed in subsection (b) of this section be taken. The
4 action ordered by the State Board shall be the least intrusive consistent with the

15 owned by the claimant.
16 (b) The Commissioner shall include in the total homestead property tax
17 exemption and municipal property tax credit amount determined under

15 payment of homestead statewide education property tax liabilities,; and any
16 late-claim reduction amount.
17 (f)(1) For taxpayers and amounts stated in the notice to towns on or before
18 July 1, municipalities shall create and send to taxpayers a homestead property
19 tax bill, instead of the bill required under subdivision 5402(b)(1) of this title,
20 providing the total amount allocated to payment of homestead statewide
21 education property tax liabilities and notice of the balance due. Municipalities

2 under this chapter to current year property taxes in equal amounts to each of
3 the taxpayers’ property tax installments that include education taxes and the
4 amount of the municipal property tax credit allocated under this chapter to
5 current year municipal property taxes in equal amounts to each of the
6 taxpayers’ property tax installments that include municipal taxes.
7 Notwithstanding section 4772 of this title, if a town issues a corrected bill as a
8 result of the notice sent by the Commissioner under subsection (a) of this
9 section, issuance of the corrected new bill does not extend the time for
10 payment of the original bill nor relieve the taxpayer of any interest or penalties
11 associated with the original bill. If the corrected bill is less than the original
12 bill, and there are also no unpaid current year taxes, interest, or penalties, and
13 no past year delinquent taxes or penalties and interest charges, any
14 overpayment shall be reflected on the corrected tax bill and refunded to the
15 taxpayer.
16 (2) For homestead property tax exemption and municipal property tax
17 credit amounts for which municipalities receive notice after November 1,
18 municipalities shall issue a new homestead property tax bill with notice to the
19 taxpayer of the total amount allocated to payment of homestead property tax
20 liabilities and notice of the balance due.

4 year homestead parcel penalties and interest, next to any prior year homestead
5 parcel penalties and interest, and last to any prior year housesite value and
6 property tax on the homestead parcel. No homestead property tax exemption
7 or municipal credit shall be allocated to a housesite value or property tax
8 liability for any year after the year for which the claim or refund allocation was
9 filed. No municipal tax-reduction incentive for early payment of taxes shall
10 apply to any amount allocated to the property tax bill under this chapter.
11 (4) If the homestead property tax exemption or the municipal property
12 tax credit amount as described in subsection (e) of this section exceeds the
13 property tax, penalties, and interest due for the current and all prior years, the
14 municipality shall refund the excess to the taxpayer, without interest, within 20
15 days of the first date upon which taxes become due and payable or 20 days

17 Taxes, whichever is later.
18 (g) The Commissioner of Taxes shall pay monthly to each municipality the

4 (f)(1) For taxpayers and amounts stated in the notice to towns on or before

7 providing the total amount allocated to payment of homestead education

6 for collection a tax assessed against real estate in the town and the taxpayer
7 owes a minimum of $1,500.00 and is delinquent for a period longer than one
8 year, the collector may extend a warrant on such land. However, no warrant

11 a collector receives notice from a mobile home park owner pursuant to 10
12 V.S.A. § 6248(b), the collector shall, within 15 days after the notice,
13 commence tax sale proceedings to hold a tax sale within 60 days after the
