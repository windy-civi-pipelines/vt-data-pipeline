Senate proposal of amendment

and finance systems
The Senate proposes to the House to amend the bill by striking out all after
the enacting clause and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
* * * Findings and Intent * * *
Sec. 1. FINDINGS; INTENT; PLAN
(a) The General Assembly finds that:
(1) In 1997, the first piece of law the General Assembly enacted in
response to the Brigham decision stated, “[t]he right to public education is
integral to Vermont’s constitutional form of government and its guarantees of
political and civil rights…[and] fundamental for the success of Vermont’s
children in a rapidly-changing society and global marketplace as well as the
State’s own economic and social prosperity.” 16 V.S.A. § 1.
(2) From the very first attempt at creating a basic frame of government,
Vermont’s founders chose to include a right to public education, the only
governmental service included in Vermont’s first Constitution of 1777.
(3) As the U.S. Supreme Court stated in Brown v. Board of Education,
347 U.S. 483 (1954), “education is perhaps the most important function of
state and local governments…[i]t is required in the performance of our most
basic public responsibilities…[i]t is the very foundation of good citizenship.”
(4) The most enduring legacy of Brigham v. State, 166 Vt. 246 (1997) is
the State’s responsibility to ensure substantially equal educational
opportunities for all Vermont students.
(5) The education system is still reeling from the effects of a global
pandemic, yet the same challenges that have faced Vermont’s education system
remain. Thirty to 40 years ago, Vermont educated more than 110,000 students
each year. Today, there are approximately 84,000 students in the public
education system. Many schools have lost a significant number of students
and, with them, the ability to offer robust services and programs at every
school. Vermont’s youth need to be prepared for a rapidly evolving future.
(6) Vermonters deserve an exceptional educational system that is stable
and predictable and where a student’s home address does not dictate the
quality of education they receive. School district size and boundaries, school
size, and class size are all influential factors in shaping the quality of
instruction and overall student outcomes. The effectiveness of our schools
depends on teacher quality, resource availability, and the unique strengths of
local communities. Change in our educational system is needed. Systems are
made of people, so change must come carefully and thoughtfully, with
meaningful engagement by all Vermonters.
(b) Intent; plan.
(1) To ensure each student is provided substantially equal educational
opportunities that will prepare them to thrive in a 21st-century world, it is the
intent of the General Assembly to work strategically, intentionally, and
thoughtfully to ensure that each incremental change made to Vermont’s public
education system provides strength and support to its only constitutionally
required governmental service.
(2) It is further the intent of the General Assembly to:
(A) in the 2026 session:
(i) enact new, larger school district boundaries that would be
effective July 1, 2027;
(ii) enact updates to career and technical education governance
systems, both at the local and statewide levels, that are reflective of the larger
public education governance transformation to new, larger school districts; and
(iii) create a coordinated and coherent statewide strategy for
career and technical education that is responsive to students and the State’s
workforce needs and that provides opportunities for more integration between
career and technical education and traditional high school work;
(B) provide or enable the provision of the necessary staffing,
resources, and support to the Agency of Education, the Secretary of State’s
Office, town clerks, and other integral parties to the election system to hold the
first school board member elections within the newly created school districts
in a special election in March 2028; and
(C) provide or enable the provision of the necessary staffing,
resources, and support to the Agency of Education, State Board of Education,
and other integral parties to ensure that the necessary guidance and funding is
in place to allow for a smooth and successful transition between the operation
of Vermont’s current 119 school districts to the new, larger school districts,
with new school districts assuming responsibility for the education of all
resident students on July 1, 2029.

Sec. 5. 16 V.S.A. § 165 is amended to read:

Section 4:
§ 165. EDUCATION QUALITY STANDARDS; EQUALEDUCATIONAL
OPPORTUNITIES; INDEPENDENT SCHOOLMEETING
EDUCATION QUALITY STANDARDS
(a) In order to carry out Vermont’s policy that all Vermont children will be
afforded educational opportunities that are substantially equal in quality, each
Vermont public school, including each career technical center, shall meet the
following education quality standards:
* * *
(9) The school complies with average class size minimum standards;
provided, however, that when class size minimums apply to content areas, an
individual class may be smaller than the minimum average. As used in this
subdivision, “content area” means a group of courses within a specific
licensing endorsement area.
(A) Class size standards.
(i) The average class size minimum for kindergarten and first
grade classes shall be 10 students.
(ii) The average class size minimum for grades two through five
shall be 12 students.
(iii) The average class size minimum for grades six through eight
in all required content areas shall be 15 students.
(iv) The average class size minimum for grades nine through 12 in
all required content area classes shall be 18 students.
(v) Multiage classrooms for grades kindergarten through eight
shall be limited to two grade levels per classroom.
(vi) Prekindergarten, career and technical education, flexible
pathways, terminal courses, advanced placement courses, courses that require
specialized equipment, and driver’s education classes shall be excluded from
the class size minimum requirements in this subdivision (9). Small group
services for the purpose of providing special education, supplemental or
targeted academic intervention, or English learner instruction shall also be
excluded from the class size minimum requirements in this subdivision (9).
(vii) Class sizes shall not exceed the maximum occupancy limits
established by local and State fire codes, including egress and safety
requirements.
(B) Waivers. If a school board determines that it operates a school
that is unable to comply with the class size minimum standards due to
geographic isolation, or a school has developed an implementation plan to
meet the standards contained in this subdivision (9) that may include
consolidation or merger, the school board may ask the State Board of
Education to grant it waiver from this subdivision (9). The State Board shall
define what qualifies as geographic isolation in its rules adopted pursuant to
subdivision (a)(3) of this section. The State Board’s decision shall be final.
(C) State Board action. If the Secretary determines that a school is
not meeting the class size minimum standards set forth in this subdivision (9)
over the course of three consecutive school years, the Secretary may
recommend to the State Board one or more of the actions listed in subsection
(b) of this section, regardless of whether the school is meeting all other
education quality standards. The State Board shall then follow the procedure
of subsection (c) of this section.
(b) Annually, the Secretary shall determine whether students in each
Vermont public school are provided educational opportunities substantially
equal to those provided in other public schools. If the Secretary determines
that a school is not meeting the education quality standards listed in subsection
(a) of this section or that the school is making insufficient progress in
improving student performance in relation to the standards for student
performance set forth in subdivision 164(9) of this title, he or she the Secretary
shall describe in writing actions that a district must take in order to meet either
or both sets of standards and shall provide technical assistance to the school.
If the school fails to meet the standards or make sufficient progress within two
years of following the determination, the Secretary shall recommend to the
State Board one or more of the following actions:
(1) the Agency continue to provide technical assistance for one more
cycle of review;
(2) the State Board adjust supervisory union boundaries or
responsibilities of the superintendency pursuant to section 261 of this title;
(3) the Secretary assume administrative control of an individual school,
school district, or supervisory union, including budgetary control to ensure
sound financial practices, only to the extent necessary to correct deficiencies;
(4) the State Board close an individual school or schools and require
that the school district pay tuition to another public school or an approved
independent school pursuant to chapter 21 of this title; or
(5) the State Board require two or more school districts to consolidate
their governance structures.
(c) The State Board, after offering the school board an opportunity for a
hearing, shall either dismiss the Secretary’s recommendation or order that one
or more of the actions listed in subsection (b) of this section be taken. The
action ordered by the State Board shall be the least intrusive consistent with
the need to provide students attending the school substantially equal
educational opportunities. A school board aggrieved by an order of the State
Board may appeal the order in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure.
* * *
(e) If the Secretary determines at any time that the failure of a school to
meet the education quality standards listed in subsection (a) of this section is
severe or pervasive, potentially results in physical or emotional harm to
students or significant deprivation of equal education opportunities, and the
school has either unreasonably refused to remedy the problem or its efforts
have proved ineffective, he or she the Secretary may recommend to the State
Board one or more of the actions listed in subsection (b) of this section. The
State Board shall then follow the procedure of subsection (c) of this section.
* * *
(g) In addition to the education quality standards provided in subsection (a)

Sec. 6. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH EDUCATION QUALITY
STANDARDS; STATE BOARD ACTION
Notwithstanding 16 V.S.A. § 165(b)(4) and (5) and any other provision of
law to the contrary, the State Board shall be prohibited from ordering school
district consolidation or school consolidation if a school fails to comply with
class size minimum education quality standards and the resulting consolidation
would result in school construction costs in excess of the applicable district’s
capital reserve account until the General Assembly establishes new school
district boundaries and takes further action regarding the consequences for
failure to meet education quality standards.
Sec. 7. STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION; RULES; REPORT
(a) Rules. On or before August 1, 2026, the State Board of Education shall
initiate rulemaking to amend:
(1) The Education Quality Standards rule 2000 series, Agency of
Education, Education Quality Standards (22-000-003), pursuant to 3 V.S.A.
chapter 25 to ensure compliance with the class size minimum standards set
pursuant to 16 V.S.A. § 165(a)(9).
(2) The approved independent school rule 2200 series, Agency of
Education, Independent School Program Approval (22-000-004), pursuant to 3
V.S.A. chapter 25, to require approved independent schools that intend to
accept public tuition to comply with the class size minimum standards set
pursuant to 16 V.S.A. § 165(a)(9). The amendments shall also create a process
for review by the State Board for failure to meet the class size minimum
requirements and the corresponding actions the Board may take for such
noncompliance; provided, however, that the Board shall provide an approved
independent school a substantially similar opportunity to come into
compliance with class size minimum standards that it would provide to a
public school.
(b) Report. On or before December 1, 2025, the State Board of Education
shall submit a written report to the House and Senate Committees on
Education with proposed standards for schools to be deemed “small by
necessity.”

PAYING TUITION
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a school district shall
be prohibited from closing an existing public school and then providing for the
education of its resident students by paying tuition for its students to attend a
public or approved independent school chosen by the parents of the district’s
students. If a school district that closes an existing public school is unable to
provide for the education of its affected resident students in a different school
or schools operated by the district, the school district shall provide for the
education of its resident students by designating three or fewer public schools
to serve as the public school or schools of the district; provided, however, that
if the closed public school is located in a geographically isolated area, as
defined by the State Board of Education, and there is no reasonably accessible
public school to designate, the applicable school district may provide for the
education of its affected resident students by offering tuition pursuant to 16
V.S.A. chapter 21. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, if
designation is required pursuant to this section, the designation process
contained in 16 V.S.A. § 827 shall apply to schools operating grades
kindergarten through grade 12, or any subset of grades therein.

the education tax rates under subsection (a) of this section divided by the
number resulting from dividing the municipality’s most recent common level
of appraisal by the statewide adjustment. The legislative body in each

itemization of the separate taxes due. The bill may be on a single sheet of
paper with the statewide education taxand other taxes presented separately and
side by side.
(3) If a district has not voted a budget by June 30, an interim homestead
education tax shall be imposed at the base rate determined under subdivision
(a)(2) of this section, divided by the number resulting from dividing the
municipality’s most recent common level of appraisal by the statewide
adjustment, but without regard to any spending adjustment under subdivision
5401(13) of this title. Within 30 days after a budget is adopted and the
deadline for reconsideration has passed, the Commissioner shall determine the

and a spending adjustment under subdivision 5401(13) of this title based upon
the per pupil education spending of the unified union.
(2) For a municipality that is a member of a union school district:
(A) Determine the municipal district homestead tax rate using the
base rate determined under subdivision (a)(2) of this section and a spending
adjustment under subdivision 5401(13) of this title based on the per pupil
education spending in the municipality who attends a school other than the
union school.
(B) Determine the union district homestead tax rate using the base
rate determined under subdivision (a)(2) of this section and a spending
adjustment under subdivision 5401(13) of this title based on the per pupil
education spending of the union school district.

school to total long-term membership of the member municipality. Total long-
term membership of the member municipality is based on the number of pupils
who are legal residents of the municipality and attending school at public
expense. If necessary, the Commissioner may adopt a rule to clarify and
facilitate implementation of this subsection (e). [Repealed.]

the school district’s per pupil supplemental district spending as certified by the
Secretary of Education by the supplemental district spending yield. The
legislative body in each member municipality shall then bill each property
taxpayer at the rate determined by the Commissioner under this subsection,
divided by the municipality’s most recent common level of appraisal and
multiplied by the current grand list value of the property to be taxed. The bill
shall show the taxdue and the calculation of the rate.
(2) The supplemental district spending tax assessed under this
subsection shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes assessed
under chapter 133 of this title with no tax classification other than as
homestead or nonhomestead property; provided, however, that the tax levied
under this chapter shall be billed to each taxpayer by the municipality in a
manner that clearly indicates the tax is separate from any other tax assessed
and collected under chapter 133 and the statewide education property taxunder
this section, including an itemization of the separate taxes due. The bill may
be on a single sheet of paper with the supplemental district spending tax, the
statewide education tax, and other taxes presented separately and side by side.
(3) The treasurer of each municipality shall on or before December 1 of
the year in which the tax is levied and on or before June 1 of the following
year pay to the State Treasurer for deposit in the Education Fund one-half of
the municipality’s supplemental district spending tax, as determined under
subdivision (1) of this subsection.
(4) The Secretary of Education shall determine each municipality’s net
supplemental district spending tax payment to the State based on grand list
information received by the Secretary not later than the March 15 prior to the
June 1 net payment. Payment shall be accompanied by a return prescribed by
the Secretary of Education. Each municipality may retain 0.225 of one
percent of the total supplemental district spending tax collected, only upon

6066 of this title, related to a homestead owned by the claimant, based on the
prior taxable year’s income and for the municipal property tax credit, crediting

exemption, exempting the housesite value in the claim year. The
Commissioner shall notify the municipality in which the housesite is located of
the amount of the homestead property tax exemption and municipal property
tax credit for the claimant for homestead property tax liabilities on a monthly
basis. The municipal property tax credit of a claimant who was assessed
property tax by a town that revised the dates of its fiscal year, however, is the
excess of the property taxthat was assessed in the last 12 months of the revised
fiscal year, over the adjusted property tax of the claimant for the revised fiscal
year, as determined under section 6066 of this title, related to a homestead
owned by the claimant.
(b) The Commissioner shall include in the total homestead property tax
exemption and municipal property tax credit amount determined under
subsection (a) of this section, for credit to the taxpayer for homestead property
tax and supplemental district spending tax liabilities, any income tax
overpayment remaining after allocation under section 3112 of this title and
setoff under section 5934 of this title, which the taxpayer has directed to be
used for payment of property taxes.
(c) The Commissioner shall notify the municipality of any claim and
refund amounts unresolved by November 1 at the time of final resolution,
including adjudication, if any; provided, however, that towns will not be
notified of any additional credit amounts after November 1 of the claim year,
and such amounts shall be paid to the claimant by the Commissioner.
(d) [Repealed.]
(e) At the time of notice to the municipality, the Commissioner shall notify
the taxpayer of the homestead property tax credit exemption amount
determined under subdivision 6066(a)(1) of this title, the amount determined
under subdivision 6066(a)(3) of this title,; any additional municipal property
credit amounts amount due the homestead owner under section subdivision
6066(a)(2) of this title,; the amount of income tax refund, if any, allocated to
payment of homestead property tax liabilities,; and any late-claim reduction
amount.
(f)(1) For taxpayers and amounts stated in the notice to towns on or before
July 1, municipalities shall create and send to taxpayers a homestead property
tax bill, instead of the bill required under subdivision 5402(b)(1) of this title,
providing the total amount allocated to payment of homestead education
property tax liabilities and notice of the balance due. Municipalities shall
apply the amount of the homestead property tax exemption allocated under this
chapter to current year property taxes in equal amounts to each of the
taxpayers’ property tax installments that include education taxes and the
amount of the municipal property tax credit allocated under this chapter to
current year municipal property taxes in equal amounts to each of the
taxpayers’ property tax installments that include municipal taxes.
Notwithstanding section 4772 of this title, if a town issues a corrected bill as a
result of the notice sent by the Commissioner under subsection (a) of this

Section 48:
section, issuance of the corrected new bill does not extend the time for
payment of the original bill nor relieve the taxpayer of any interest or penalties
associated with the original bill. If the corrected bill is less than the original
bill, and there are also no unpaid current year taxes, interest, or penalties, and
no past year delinquent taxes or penalties and interest charges, any
overpayment shall be reflected on the corrected tax bill and refunded to the
taxpayer.
(2) For homestead property tax exemption and municipal property tax
credit amounts for which municipalities receive notice after November 1,
municipalities shall issue a new homestead property tax bill with notice to the
taxpayer of the total amount allocated to payment of homestead property tax
liabilities and notice of the balance due.
(3) The homestead property tax exemption and municipal property tax
credit amount determined for the taxpayer shall be allocated first to current
year housesite value and property tax on the homestead parcel, next to current-
year homestead parcel penalties and interest, next to any prior year homestead
parcel penalties and interest, and last to any prior year housesite value and
property tax on the homestead parcel. No homestead property tax exemption
or municipal credit shall be allocated to a housesite value or property tax
liability for any year after the year for which the claim or refund allocation
was filed. No municipal tax-reduction incentive for early payment of taxes
shall apply to any amount allocated to the property taxbill under this chapter.
(4) If the homestead property tax exemption or the municipal property
tax credit amount as described in subsection (e) of this section exceeds the
property tax, penalties, and interest due for the current and all prior years, the
municipality shall refund the excess to the taxpayer, without interest, within 20
days of the first date upon which taxes become due and payable or 20 days
after notification of the exemption or credit amount by the Commissioner of
Taxes, whichever is later.
(g) The Commissioner of Taxes shall pay monthly to each municipality the
amount of municipal property tax credit of which the municipality was last
notified related to municipal property tax on homesteads within that
municipality, as determined by the Commissioner of Taxes.

Section 49:
§ 6067. CREDIT CLAIM LIMITATIONS
(a) Claimant. Only one individual per household per taxable year shall be
entitled to a homestead exemption claim or property tax credit claim, or both,

property tax or income tax or paid by the State until repaid by the claimant at
the rate per annum established from time to time by the Commissioner

(4) standardized practices for a full reappraisal, including cases in which
physical inspections are unnecessary and how technology is to be utilized.
(b) The Director of Property Valuation and Review shall establish a
schedule for each regional assessment district to fully reappraise every six
years. The Director, at the Director’s discretion, may alter the reappraisal
schedule for a regional assessment district or for one or more of a regional

Sec. 65. 32 V.S.A. § 6066a(f)(1) is amended to read:
(f)(1) For taxpayers and amounts stated in the notice to towns on or before
July 1, municipalities shall create and send to taxpayers a homestead property
tax bill, instead of the bill required under subdivision 5402(b)(1) of this title,
providing the total amount allocated to payment of homestead education
property tax liabilities and notice of the balance due. Nothing in this
subdivision, however, shall be interpreted as altering the requirement under
subdivision 5402(b)(2) of this title that the statewide education homestead tax
be billed in a manner that is stated clearly and separately from any other tax.
Municipalities shall apply the amount allocated under this chapter to current
year property taxes in equal amounts to each of the taxpayers’ property tax
installments that include education taxes. Notwithstanding section 4772 of this
title, if a town issues a corrected bill as a result of the notice sent by the
Commissioner under subsection (a) of this section, issuance of the corrected
new bill does not extend the time for payment of the original bill nor relieve
the taxpayer of any interest or penalties associated with the original bill. If the
corrected bill is less than the original bill, and there are also no unpaid current
year taxes, interest, or penalties, and no past year delinquent taxes or penalties
and interest charges, any overpayment shall be reflected on the corrected tax
bill and refunded to the taxpayer.

owes a minimum of $1,500.00 and is delinquent for a period longer than one
year, the collector may extend a warrant on such land. However, no warrant
shall be extended until a delinquent taxpayer is given an opportunity to enter a
written reasonable repayment plan pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. If
a collector receives notice from a mobile home park owner pursuant to 10
V.S.A. § 6248(b), the collector shall, within 15 days after the notice,
commence tax sale proceedings to hold a tax sale within 60 days after the
notice. If the collector fails to initiate such proceedings, the town may initiate
tax sale proceedings only after complying with 10 V.S.A. § 6249(f). If the tax
collector extends the warrant, the collector shall:

Sec. 67. 32 V.S.A. § 4465 is amended to read:

Section 69:
§ 4465. APPOINTMENT OF PROPERTY VALUATION HEARING
OFFICER; OATH; PAY
When an appeal to the Director is not withdrawn or forwarded by the
Director to Superior Court pursuant to subsection 4461(a) of this title, the
Director shall refer the appeal in writing to a person not employed by the
Director, appointed by the Director as hearing officer. The Director shall have
the right to remove a hearing officer for inefficiency, malfeasance in office, or
other cause. In like manner, the Director shall appoint a hearing officer to fill
any vacancy created by resignation, removal, or other cause. Before entering
into their duties, persons appointed as hearing officers shall take and subscribe
the oath of the office prescribed in the Constitution, which oath shall be filed
with the Director. The Director Commissioner of Taxes shall pay each hearing
officer a sum not to exceed $150.00 per diem for each day wherein hearings
are held $38.00 per hour plus a cost-of-living adjustment in an amount equal to
any adjustment approved for exempt employees by the Secretary of

Commissioner may determine. A hearing officer may subpoena witnesses,
records, and documents in the manner provided by law for serving subpoenas
in civil actions and may administer oaths to witnesses.
Sec. 68. 32 V.S.A. § 5402(c)(2) is amended to read:
(2) The Secretary of Education shall determine each municipality’s net
nonhomestead education tax payment and its net homestead education tax
payment to the State based on grand list information received by the Secretary
not later than the March 15 prior to the June 1 net payment. Payment shall be
accompanied by a return prescribed by the Secretary of Education. Each
municipality may retain 0.225 of one percent of the total education tax
collected, only upon timely remittance of net payment to the State Treasurer or
to the applicable school district or districts. Each municipality may also retain
$15.00 for each late property tax credit claim filed after April 15 and before
September 2, as notified by the Department of Taxes, for the cost of issuing a
new property taxbill.
Sec. 69. 32 V.S.A. § 5401(13) is amended to read:
(13)(A) “Education property tax spending adjustment” means the
greater of one or a fraction in which:

Raw Text:
Senate proposal of amendment
H. 454
An act relating to transforming Vermont’s education governance, quality,
and finance systems
The Senate proposes to the House to amend the bill by striking out all after
the enacting clause and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
* * * Findings and Intent * * *
Sec. 1. FINDINGS; INTENT; PLAN
(a) The General Assembly finds that:
(1) In 1997, the first piece of law the General Assembly enacted in
response to the Brigham decision stated, “[t]he right to public education is
integral to Vermont’s constitutional form of government and its guarantees of
political and civil rights…[and] fundamental for the success of Vermont’s
children in a rapidly-changing society and global marketplace as well as the
State’s own economic and social prosperity.” 16 V.S.A. § 1.
(2) From the very first attempt at creating a basic frame of government,
Vermont’s founders chose to include a right to public education, the only
governmental service included in Vermont’s first Constitution of 1777.
(3) As the U.S. Supreme Court stated in Brown v. Board of Education,
347 U.S. 483 (1954), “education is perhaps the most important function of
state and local governments…[i]t is required in the performance of our most
basic public responsibilities…[i]t is the very foundation of good citizenship.”
(4) The most enduring legacy of Brigham v. State, 166 Vt. 246 (1997) is
the State’s responsibility to ensure substantially equal educational
opportunities for all Vermont students.
(5) The education system is still reeling from the effects of a global
pandemic, yet the same challenges that have faced Vermont’s education system
remain. Thirty to 40 years ago, Vermont educated more than 110,000 students
each year. Today, there are approximately 84,000 students in the public
education system. Many schools have lost a significant number of students
and, with them, the ability to offer robust services and programs at every
school. Vermont’s youth need to be prepared for a rapidly evolving future.
(6) Vermonters deserve an exceptional educational system that is stable
and predictable and where a student’s home address does not dictate the
quality of education they receive. School district size and boundaries, school
size, and class size are all influential factors in shaping the quality of
instruction and overall student outcomes. The effectiveness of our schools
depends on teacher quality, resource availability, and the unique strengths of

local communities. Change in our educational system is needed. Systems are
made of people, so change must come carefully and thoughtfully, with
meaningful engagement by all Vermonters.
(b) Intent; plan.
(1) To ensure each student is provided substantially equal educational
opportunities that will prepare them to thrive in a 21st-century world, it is the
intent of the General Assembly to work strategically, intentionally, and
thoughtfully to ensure that each incremental change made to Vermont’s public
education system provides strength and support to its only constitutionally
required governmental service.
(2) It is further the intent of the General Assembly to:
(A) in the 2026 session:
(i) enact new, larger school district boundaries that would be
effective July 1, 2027;
(ii) enact updates to career and technical education governance
systems, both at the local and statewide levels, that are reflective of the larger
public education governance transformation to new, larger school districts; and
(iii) create a coordinated and coherent statewide strategy for
career and technical education that is responsive to students and the State’s
workforce needs and that provides opportunities for more integration between
career and technical education and traditional high school work;
(B) provide or enable the provision of the necessary staffing,
resources, and support to the Agency of Education, the Secretary of State’s
Office, town clerks, and other integral parties to the election system to hold the
first school board member elections within the newly created school districts
in a special election in March 2028; and
(C) provide or enable the provision of the necessary staffing,
resources, and support to the Agency of Education, State Board of Education,
and other integral parties to ensure that the necessary guidance and funding is
in place to allow for a smooth and successful transition between the operation
of Vermont’s current 119 school districts to the new, larger school districts,
with new school districts assuming responsibility for the education of all
resident students on July 1, 2029.
* * * Commission on the Future of Public Education * * *

by leveraging attainable and research-based scale to increase equity of
opportunity and promote efficiency and affordability.
Sec. 5. 16 V.S.A. § 165 is amended to read:
§ 165. EDUCATION QUALITY STANDARDS; EQUALEDUCATIONAL
OPPORTUNITIES; INDEPENDENT SCHOOLMEETING
EDUCATION QUALITY STANDARDS
(a) In order to carry out Vermont’s policy that all Vermont children will be
afforded educational opportunities that are substantially equal in quality, each
Vermont public school, including each career technical center, shall meet the
following education quality standards:
* * *
(9) The school complies with average class size minimum standards;
provided, however, that when class size minimums apply to content areas, an
individual class may be smaller than the minimum average. As used in this
subdivision, “content area” means a group of courses within a specific
licensing endorsement area.
(A) Class size standards.
(i) The average class size minimum for kindergarten and first
grade classes shall be 10 students.
(ii) The average class size minimum for grades two through five
shall be 12 students.

(iii) The average class size minimum for grades six through eight
in all required content areas shall be 15 students.
(iv) The average class size minimum for grades nine through 12 in
all required content area classes shall be 18 students.
(v) Multiage classrooms for grades kindergarten through eight
shall be limited to two grade levels per classroom.
(vi) Prekindergarten, career and technical education, flexible
pathways, terminal courses, advanced placement courses, courses that require
specialized equipment, and driver’s education classes shall be excluded from
the class size minimum requirements in this subdivision (9). Small group
services for the purpose of providing special education, supplemental or
targeted academic intervention, or English learner instruction shall also be
excluded from the class size minimum requirements in this subdivision (9).
(vii) Class sizes shall not exceed the maximum occupancy limits
established by local and State fire codes, including egress and safety
requirements.
(B) Waivers. If a school board determines that it operates a school
that is unable to comply with the class size minimum standards due to
geographic isolation, or a school has developed an implementation plan to
meet the standards contained in this subdivision (9) that may include
consolidation or merger, the school board may ask the State Board of
Education to grant it waiver from this subdivision (9). The State Board shall
define what qualifies as geographic isolation in its rules adopted pursuant to
subdivision (a)(3) of this section. The State Board’s decision shall be final.
(C) State Board action. If the Secretary determines that a school is
not meeting the class size minimum standards set forth in this subdivision (9)
over the course of three consecutive school years, the Secretary may
recommend to the State Board one or more of the actions listed in subsection
(b) of this section, regardless of whether the school is meeting all other
education quality standards. The State Board shall then follow the procedure
of subsection (c) of this section.
(b) Annually, the Secretary shall determine whether students in each
Vermont public school are provided educational opportunities substantially
equal to those provided in other public schools. If the Secretary determines
that a school is not meeting the education quality standards listed in subsection
(a) of this section or that the school is making insufficient progress in
improving student performance in relation to the standards for student
performance set forth in subdivision 164(9) of this title, he or she the Secretary
shall describe in writing actions that a district must take in order to meet either
or both sets of standards and shall provide technical assistance to the school.

If the school fails to meet the standards or make sufficient progress within two
years of following the determination, the Secretary shall recommend to the
State Board one or more of the following actions:
(1) the Agency continue to provide technical assistance for one more
cycle of review;
(2) the State Board adjust supervisory union boundaries or
responsibilities of the superintendency pursuant to section 261 of this title;
(3) the Secretary assume administrative control of an individual school,
school district, or supervisory union, including budgetary control to ensure
sound financial practices, only to the extent necessary to correct deficiencies;
(4) the State Board close an individual school or schools and require
that the school district pay tuition to another public school or an approved
independent school pursuant to chapter 21 of this title; or
(5) the State Board require two or more school districts to consolidate
their governance structures.
(c) The State Board, after offering the school board an opportunity for a
hearing, shall either dismiss the Secretary’s recommendation or order that one
or more of the actions listed in subsection (b) of this section be taken. The
action ordered by the State Board shall be the least intrusive consistent with
the need to provide students attending the school substantially equal
educational opportunities. A school board aggrieved by an order of the State
Board may appeal the order in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure.
* * *
(e) If the Secretary determines at any time that the failure of a school to
meet the education quality standards listed in subsection (a) of this section is
severe or pervasive, potentially results in physical or emotional harm to
students or significant deprivation of equal education opportunities, and the
school has either unreasonably refused to remedy the problem or its efforts
have proved ineffective, he or she the Secretary may recommend to the State
Board one or more of the actions listed in subsection (b) of this section. The
State Board shall then follow the procedure of subsection (c) of this section.
* * *
(g) In addition to the education quality standards provided in subsection (a)
of this section, each Vermont school district shall meet the school district
quality standards adopted by rule of the Agency of Education regarding the
business, facilities management, and governance practices of school districts.
These standards shall include a process for school district quality reviews to be
conducted by the Agency of Education. Annually, the Secretary shall publish
metrics regarding the outcomes of school district quality reviews.

Sec. 6. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH EDUCATION QUALITY
STANDARDS; STATE BOARD ACTION
Notwithstanding 16 V.S.A. § 165(b)(4) and (5) and any other provision of
law to the contrary, the State Board shall be prohibited from ordering school
district consolidation or school consolidation if a school fails to comply with
class size minimum education quality standards and the resulting consolidation
would result in school construction costs in excess of the applicable district’s
capital reserve account until the General Assembly establishes new school
district boundaries and takes further action regarding the consequences for
failure to meet education quality standards.
Sec. 7. STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION; RULES; REPORT
(a) Rules. On or before August 1, 2026, the State Board of Education shall
initiate rulemaking to amend:
(1) The Education Quality Standards rule 2000 series, Agency of
Education, Education Quality Standards (22-000-003), pursuant to 3 V.S.A.
chapter 25 to ensure compliance with the class size minimum standards set
pursuant to 16 V.S.A. § 165(a)(9).
(2) The approved independent school rule 2200 series, Agency of
Education, Independent School Program Approval (22-000-004), pursuant to 3
V.S.A. chapter 25, to require approved independent schools that intend to
accept public tuition to comply with the class size minimum standards set
pursuant to 16 V.S.A. § 165(a)(9). The amendments shall also create a process
for review by the State Board for failure to meet the class size minimum
requirements and the corresponding actions the Board may take for such
noncompliance; provided, however, that the Board shall provide an approved
independent school a substantially similar opportunity to come into
compliance with class size minimum standards that it would provide to a
public school.
(b) Report. On or before December 1, 2025, the State Board of Education
shall submit a written report to the House and Senate Committees on
Education with proposed standards for schools to be deemed “small by
necessity.”
Sec. 8. PROHIBITION ON SCHOOLCLOSURE AND TRANSITION TO
PAYING TUITION
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a school district shall
be prohibited from closing an existing public school and then providing for the
education of its resident students by paying tuition for its students to attend a
public or approved independent school chosen by the parents of the district’s
students. If a school district that closes an existing public school is unable to
provide for the education of its affected resident students in a different school

or schools operated by the district, the school district shall provide for the
education of its resident students by designating three or fewer public schools
to serve as the public school or schools of the district; provided, however, that
if the closed public school is located in a geographically isolated area, as
defined by the State Board of Education, and there is no reasonably accessible
public school to designate, the applicable school district may provide for the
education of its affected resident students by offering tuition pursuant to 16
V.S.A. chapter 21. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, if
designation is required pursuant to this section, the designation process
contained in 16 V.S.A. § 827 shall apply to schools operating grades
kindergarten through grade 12, or any subset of grades therein.
Sec. 9. 16 V.S.A. § 3440 is added to read:
§ 3440. STATEMENT OF POLICY
It is the intent of this chapter to encourage the efficient use of public funds
to modernize school infrastructure in alignment with current educational
needs. School construction projects supported by this chapter should be
developed taking consideration of standards of quality for public schools under
section 165 of this title and prioritizing cost, geographic accessibility, 21st
century education facilities standards, statewide enrollment trends, and
capacity and scale that support best educational practices. Further, it is the
intent of this chapter to encourage the use of existing infrastructure to meet the
needs of Vermont students. Joint construction projects between two or more
school districts and consolidation of buildings within a district where feasible
and educationally appropriate are encouraged.

payment. As soon as reasonably possible after a school district budget is
approved by voters, the Secretary shall determine the per pupil education
spending for the next fiscal year for the school district. Per pupil education
spending shall equal a school district’s education spending divided by its
weighted long-term membership The Secretary shall determine each school
district’s educational opportunity payment by multiplying the school district’s

education tax shall be imposed at the base rate determined under subdivision
(a)(2) of this section, divided by the number resulting from dividing the
municipality’s most recent common level of appraisal by the statewide
adjustment, but without regard to any spending adjustment under subdivision

(A) Determine the municipal district homestead tax rate using the
base rate determined under subdivision (a)(2) of this section and a spending
adjustment under subdivision 5401(13) of this title based on the per pupil
education spending in the municipality who attends a school other than the
union school.
(B) Determine the union district homestead tax rate using the base
rate determined under subdivision (a)(2) of this section and a spending
adjustment under subdivision 5401(13) of this title based on the per pupil
education spending of the union school district.

taxpayer at the rate determined by the Commissioner under this subsection,
divided by the municipality’s most recent common level of appraisal and
multiplied by the current grand list value of the property to be taxed. The bill
shall show the taxdue and the calculation of the rate.

subsection shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes assessed
under chapter 133 of this title with no tax classification other than as
homestead or nonhomestead property; provided, however, that the tax levied
under this chapter shall be billed to each taxpayer by the municipality in a
manner that clearly indicates the tax is separate from any other tax assessed

and collected under chapter 133 and the statewide education property taxunder
this section, including an itemization of the separate taxes due. The bill may
be on a single sheet of paper with the supplemental district spending tax, the
statewide education tax, and other taxes presented separately and side by side.
(3) The treasurer of each municipality shall on or before December 1 of
the year in which the tax is levied and on or before June 1 of the following
year pay to the State Treasurer for deposit in the Education Fund one-half of
the municipality’s supplemental district spending tax, as determined under
subdivision (1) of this subsection.
(4) The Secretary of Education shall determine each municipality’s net
supplemental district spending tax payment to the State based on grand list
information received by the Secretary not later than the March 15 prior to the
June 1 net payment. Payment shall be accompanied by a return prescribed by
the Secretary of Education. Each municipality may retain 0.225 of one

6066 of this title, related to a homestead owned by the claimant, based on the
prior taxable year’s income and for the municipal property tax credit, crediting
property taxes paid in the prior year, and for the homestead property tax
exemption, exempting the housesite value in the claim year. The
Commissioner shall notify the municipality in which the housesite is located of
the amount of the homestead property tax exemption and municipal property
tax credit for the claimant for homestead property tax liabilities on a monthly
basis. The municipal property tax credit of a claimant who was assessed
property tax by a town that revised the dates of its fiscal year, however, is the
excess of the property taxthat was assessed in the last 12 months of the revised
fiscal year, over the adjusted property tax of the claimant for the revised fiscal
year, as determined under section 6066 of this title, related to a homestead
owned by the claimant.
(b) The Commissioner shall include in the total homestead property tax
exemption and municipal property tax credit amount determined under
subsection (a) of this section, for credit to the taxpayer for homestead property
tax and supplemental district spending tax liabilities, any income tax
overpayment remaining after allocation under section 3112 of this title and
setoff under section 5934 of this title, which the taxpayer has directed to be
used for payment of property taxes.
(c) The Commissioner shall notify the municipality of any claim and
refund amounts unresolved by November 1 at the time of final resolution,
including adjudication, if any; provided, however, that towns will not be
notified of any additional credit amounts after November 1 of the claim year,
and such amounts shall be paid to the claimant by the Commissioner.
(d) [Repealed.]
(e) At the time of notice to the municipality, the Commissioner shall notify
the taxpayer of the homestead property tax credit exemption amount
determined under subdivision 6066(a)(1) of this title, the amount determined
under subdivision 6066(a)(3) of this title,; any additional municipal property
credit amounts amount due the homestead owner under section subdivision
6066(a)(2) of this title,; the amount of income tax refund, if any, allocated to
payment of homestead property tax liabilities,; and any late-claim reduction
amount.
(f)(1) For taxpayers and amounts stated in the notice to towns on or before
July 1, municipalities shall create and send to taxpayers a homestead property
tax bill, instead of the bill required under subdivision 5402(b)(1) of this title,

providing the total amount allocated to payment of homestead education
property tax liabilities and notice of the balance due. Municipalities shall
apply the amount of the homestead property tax exemption allocated under this
chapter to current year property taxes in equal amounts to each of the
taxpayers’ property tax installments that include education taxes and the
amount of the municipal property tax credit allocated under this chapter to
current year municipal property taxes in equal amounts to each of the
taxpayers’ property tax installments that include municipal taxes.
Notwithstanding section 4772 of this title, if a town issues a corrected bill as a
result of the notice sent by the Commissioner under subsection (a) of this
section, issuance of the corrected new bill does not extend the time for
payment of the original bill nor relieve the taxpayer of any interest or penalties
associated with the original bill. If the corrected bill is less than the original
bill, and there are also no unpaid current year taxes, interest, or penalties, and
no past year delinquent taxes or penalties and interest charges, any
overpayment shall be reflected on the corrected tax bill and refunded to the
taxpayer.
(2) For homestead property tax exemption and municipal property tax
credit amounts for which municipalities receive notice after November 1,
municipalities shall issue a new homestead property tax bill with notice to the
taxpayer of the total amount allocated to payment of homestead property tax
liabilities and notice of the balance due.
(3) The homestead property tax exemption and municipal property tax
credit amount determined for the taxpayer shall be allocated first to current
year housesite value and property tax on the homestead parcel, next to current-
year homestead parcel penalties and interest, next to any prior year homestead
parcel penalties and interest, and last to any prior year housesite value and
property tax on the homestead parcel. No homestead property tax exemption
or municipal credit shall be allocated to a housesite value or property tax
liability for any year after the year for which the claim or refund allocation
was filed. No municipal tax-reduction incentive for early payment of taxes
shall apply to any amount allocated to the property taxbill under this chapter.
(4) If the homestead property tax exemption or the municipal property
tax credit amount as described in subsection (e) of this section exceeds the
property tax, penalties, and interest due for the current and all prior years, the
municipality shall refund the excess to the taxpayer, without interest, within 20
days of the first date upon which taxes become due and payable or 20 days
after notification of the exemption or credit amount by the Commissioner of
Taxes, whichever is later.
(g) The Commissioner of Taxes shall pay monthly to each municipality the
amount of municipal property tax credit of which the municipality was last

notified related to municipal property tax on homesteads within that
municipality, as determined by the Commissioner of Taxes.
§ 6067. CREDIT CLAIM LIMITATIONS
(a) Claimant. Only one individual per household per taxable year shall be
entitled to a homestead exemption claim or property tax credit claim, or both,

penalty, shall bear interest from the date the claim was credited against
property tax or income tax or paid by the State until repaid by the claimant at
the rate per annum established from time to time by the Commissioner
pursuant to section 3108 of this title. The claimant in that case, and any

tax bill, instead of the bill required under subdivision 5402(b)(1) of this title,
providing the total amount allocated to payment of homestead education
property tax liabilities and notice of the balance due. Nothing in this
subdivision, however, shall be interpreted as altering the requirement under
subdivision 5402(b)(2) of this title that the statewide education homestead tax
be billed in a manner that is stated clearly and separately from any other tax.
Municipalities shall apply the amount allocated under this chapter to current
year property taxes in equal amounts to each of the taxpayers’ property tax
installments that include education taxes. Notwithstanding section 4772 of this
title, if a town issues a corrected bill as a result of the notice sent by the
Commissioner under subsection (a) of this section, issuance of the corrected
new bill does not extend the time for payment of the original bill nor relieve
the taxpayer of any interest or penalties associated with the original bill. If the

year taxes, interest, or penalties, and no past year delinquent taxes or penalties
and interest charges, any overpayment shall be reflected on the corrected tax
bill and refunded to the taxpayer.

year, the collector may extend a warrant on such land. However, no warrant
shall be extended until a delinquent taxpayer is given an opportunity to enter a
written reasonable repayment plan pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. If
a collector receives notice from a mobile home park owner pursuant to 10
V.S.A. § 6248(b), the collector shall, within 15 days after the notice,
commence tax sale proceedings to hold a tax sale within 60 days after the
notice. If the collector fails to initiate such proceedings, the town may initiate
tax sale proceedings only after complying with 10 V.S.A. § 6249(f). If the tax
collector extends the warrant, the collector shall:

Sec. 67. 32 V.S.A. § 4465 is amended to read:
§ 4465. APPOINTMENT OF PROPERTY VALUATION HEARING
OFFICER; OATH; PAY
When an appeal to the Director is not withdrawn or forwarded by the
Director to Superior Court pursuant to subsection 4461(a) of this title, the
Director shall refer the appeal in writing to a person not employed by the
Director, appointed by the Director as hearing officer. The Director shall have
the right to remove a hearing officer for inefficiency, malfeasance in office, or
other cause. In like manner, the Director shall appoint a hearing officer to fill
any vacancy created by resignation, removal, or other cause. Before entering
into their duties, persons appointed as hearing officers shall take and subscribe
the oath of the office prescribed in the Constitution, which oath shall be filed
with the Director. The Director Commissioner of Taxes shall pay each hearing
officer a sum not to exceed $150.00 per diem for each day wherein hearings

records, and documents in the manner provided by law for serving subpoenas
in civil actions and may administer oaths to witnesses.
Sec. 68. 32 V.S.A. § 5402(c)(2) is amended to read:

(2) The Secretary of Education shall determine each municipality’s net
nonhomestead education tax payment and its net homestead education tax
payment to the State based on grand list information received by the Secretary
not later than the March 15 prior to the June 1 net payment. Payment shall be
accompanied by a return prescribed by the Secretary of Education. Each
municipality may retain 0.225 of one percent of the total education tax
collected, only upon timely remittance of net payment to the State Treasurer or
to the applicable school district or districts. Each municipality may also retain
$15.00 for each late property tax credit claim filed after April 15 and before
September 2, as notified by the Department of Taxes, for the cost of issuing a
new property taxbill.
Sec. 69. 32 V.S.A. § 5401(13) is amended to read:
(13)(A) “Education property tax spending adjustment” means the
greater of one or a fraction in which:
