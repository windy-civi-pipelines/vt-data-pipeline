17 personal data or targeted advertising pursuant to subdivision 2418(a)(7) of this
18 title by means of a platform, technology, or mechanism that:
19 (A) is consumer friendly and easy for an average consumer to use;

9 personal data pursuant to subdivision 2418(a)(7) of this title and the decision
10 conflicts with a consumer’s existing controller-specific privacy setting or
11 voluntary participation in a bona fide reward, club card, or loyalty program or
12 a program that provides premium features or discounts, the controller shall
13 comply with the consumer’s opt-out preference signal but may notify the
14 consumer of the conflict and provide to the consumer the choice to confirm the
15 controller-specific privacy setting or participation in the program.
16 § 2420. DUTIES OF PROCESSORS
17 (a) A processor shall adhere to a controller’s instructions and shall assist
18 the controller in meeting the controller’s obligations under this chapter. In
19 assisting the controller, the processor must:
20 (1) enable the controller to respond to requests from consumers pursuant
21 to subsection 2418(b) of this title by means that:
VT LEG #378938 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.208
2025 Page 43 of 65
1 (A) take into account how the processor processes personal data and
2 the information available to the processor; and
3 (B) use appropriate technical and organizational measures to the
4 extent reasonably practicable;
5 (2) adopt administrative, technical, and physical safeguards that are
6 reasonably designed to protect the security and confidentiality of the personal
7 data the processor processes, taking into account how the processor processes
8 the personal data and the information available to the processor; and
9 (3) provide information reasonably necessary for the controller to
10 conduct and document data protection assessments.
11 (b) Processing by a processor must be governed by a contract between the
12 controller and the processor. The contract must:
13 (1) be valid and binding on both parties;
14 (2) set forth clear instructions for processing data, the nature and
15 purpose of the processing, the type of data that is subject to processing,
16 limitations, and the duration of the processing;
17 (3) specify the rights and obligations of both parties with respect to the
18 subject matter of the contract;
19 (4) ensure that each person that processes personal data is subject to a
20 duty of confidentiality with respect to the personal data;

BILL AS INTRODUCED H.208
2025 Page 44 of 65
1 (5) require the processor to delete the personal data or return the
2 personal data to the controller at the controller’s direction or at the end of the
3 provision of services, unless a law requires the processor to retain the personal
4 data;
5 (6) require the processor to make available to the controller, at the
6 controller’s request, all information the controller needs to verify that the
7 processor has complied with all obligations the processor has under this
8 chapter;
9 (7) require the processor to enter into a subcontract with a person the
10 processor engages to assist with processing personal data on the controller’s
11 behalf and in the subcontract require the subcontractor to meet the processor’s
12 obligations concerning personal data;
13 (8)(A) allow the controller, the controller’s designee, or a qualified and
14 independent person the processor engages, in accordance with an appropriate
15 and accepted control standard, framework, or procedure, to assess the
16 processor’s policies and technical and organizational measures for complying
17 with the processor’s obligations under this chapter;
18 (B) require the processor to cooperate with the assessment; and
19 (C) at the controller’s request, report the results of the assessment to
20 the controller;
VT LEG #378938 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.208
2025 Page 45 of 65
1 (9) prohibit the processor from combining personal data obtained from
2 the controller with personal data that the processor:
3 (A) receives from or on behalf of another controller or person; or
4 (B) collects directly from an individual; and
5 (10) require the processor to adhere to equivalent or greater de-
6 identification standards.
7 (c) This section does not relieve a controller or processor from any liability
8 that accrues under this chapter as a result of the controller’s or processor’s
9 actions in processing personal data.
10 (d)(1) For purposes of determining obligations under this chapter, a person
11 is a controller with respect to processing a set of personal data and is subject to
12 an action under section 2424 of this title to punish a violation of this chapter, if
13 the person:
14 (A) does not adhere to a controller’s instructions to process the
15 personal data; or
16 (B) begins at any point to determine the purposes and means for
17 processing the personal data, alone or in concert with another person.
18 (2) A determination under this subsection is a fact-based determination
19 that must take account of the context in which a set of personal data is
20 processed.

1 (3) A processor that adheres to a controller’s instructions with respect to
2 a specific processing of personal data remains a processor.
3 § 2421. DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENTS FOR PROCESSING
4 ACTIVITIES THAT PRESENT A HEIGHTENED RISK OF HARM
5 TO A CONSUMER
6 (a) A controller shall conduct and document a data protection assessment
7 for each of the controller’s processing activities that presents a heightened risk
8 of harm to a consumer, which, for the purposes of this section, includes:
9 (1) the processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted
10 advertising;
11 (2) the sale of personal data;
12 (3) the processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, where
13 the profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:
14 (A) unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on,
15 consumers;
16 (B) financial, physical, or reputational injury to consumers;
17 (C) a physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the
18 private affairs or concerns, of consumers, where the intrusion would be
19 offensive to a reasonable person; or
20 (D) other substantial injury to consumers; and
21 (4) the processing of sensitive data.
VT LEG #378938 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.208
2025 Page 47 of 65
1 (b)(1) Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (a) of
2 this section shall:
3 (A) identify the categories of personal data processed, the purposes
4 for processing the personal data, and whether the personal data is being
5 transferred to third parties; and
6 (B) identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and
7 indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other
8 stakeholders, and the public against the potential risks to the consumer
9 associated with the processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can be
10 employed by the controller to reduce the risks.
11 (2) The controller shall factor into any data protection assessment the
12 use of de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well
13 as the context of the processing and the relationship between the controller and
14 the consumer whose personal data will be processed.
15 (c)(1) The Attorney General may require that a controller disclose any data
16 protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the
17 Attorney General pursuant to section 2424 of this title, and the controller shall
18 make the data protection assessment available to the Attorney General.
19 (2) The Attorney General may evaluate the data protection assessment
20 for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in this chapter.
VT LEG #378938 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.208
2025 Page 48 of 65
1 (3) Data protection assessments shall be confidential and shall be
2 exempt from disclosure and copying under the Public Records Act.
3 (4) To the extent any information contained in a data protection
4 assessment disclosed to the Attorney General includes information subject to
5 attorney-client privilege or work product protection, the disclosure shall not
6 constitute a waiver of the privilege or protection.
7 (d) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of
8 processing operations that present a similar heightened risk of harm.
9 (e) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of
10 complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection
11 assessment shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements established in this
12 section if the data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and
13 effect to the data protection assessment that would otherwise be conducted
14 pursuant to this section.
15 (f) A controller shall update the data protection assessment as often as
16 appropriate considering the type, amount, and sensitivity of personal data
17 collected or processed and level of risk presented by the processing throughout
18 the processing activity’s lifecycle in order to:
19 (1) monitor for harm caused by the processing and adjust safeguards
20 accordingly; and
VT LEG #378938 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.208
2025 Page 49 of 65
1 (2) ensure that data protection and privacy are considered as the
2 controller makes new decisions with respect to the processing.
3 (g) A controller shall retain for at least three years all data protection
4 assessments the controller conducts under this section.
5 § 2422. DE-IDENTIFIED DATA
6 (a) A controller in possession of de-identified data shall:
7 (1) take reasonable measures to ensure that the data cannot be used to
8 reidentify an identified or identifiable individual or be associated with an
9 individual or device that identifies or is linked or reasonably linkable to an
10 individual or household;
11 (2) publicly commit to maintaining and using de-identified data without
12 attempting to reidentify the data; and
13 (3) contractually obligate any recipients of the de-identified data to
14 comply with the provisions of this chapter.

16 de-identified data solely for the purpose of testing the controller’s methods for
17 de-identifying data.
18 (c) This chapter shall not be construed to require a controller or processor
19 to:
20 (1) reidentify de-identified data; or
VT LEG #378938 v.1
BILL AS INTRODUCED H.208
2025 Page 50 of 65
1 (2) maintain data in identifiable form, or collect, obtain, retain, or access
2 any data or technology, in order to associate a consumer with personal data in
3 order to authenticate the consumer’s request under subsection 2418(b) of this
4 title; or
5 (3) comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if the
6 controller:
7 (A) is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the
8 personal data or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to
9 associate the request with the personal data; and
10 (B) does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the
11 specific consumer who is the subject of the personal data or associate the
12 personal data with other personal data about the same specific consumer.
13 (d) A controller that discloses or transfers de-identified data shall exercise
14 reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any contractual commitments
15 to which the de-identified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to
16 address any breaches of those contractual commitments.
17 § 2423. CONSTRUCTION OF DUTIES OF CONTROLLERS AND
18 PROCESSORS

11 page, provide another method the consumer can use to opt out, which may
12 include an internet hyperlink clearly labeled “Your Opt-Out Rights” or “Your
13 Privacy Rights” that directly effectuates the opt-out request or takes consumers
14 to a web page where the consumer can make the opt-out request; and

8 (f)(1)(J) of this section to opt out of a controller’s processing of the consumer’s
9 personal data pursuant to subdivision 2418(a)(7) of this title and the decision
10 conflicts with a consumer’s existing controller-specific privacy setting or
11 voluntary participation in a bona fide reward, club card, or loyalty program or
12 a program that provides premium features or discounts, the controller shall
13 comply with the consumer’s opt-out preference signal but may notify the
14 consumer of the conflict and provide to the consumer the choice to confirm the
15 controller-specific privacy setting or participation in the program.
16 § 2420. DUTIES OF PROCESSORS

6 identification standards.
7 (c) This section does not relieve a controller or processor from any liability
8 that accrues under this chapter as a result of the controller’s or processor’s
9 actions in processing personal data.
10 (d)(1) For purposes of determining obligations under this chapter, a person
11 is a controller with respect to processing a set of personal data and is subject to
12 an action under section 2424 of this title to punish a violation of this chapter, if

14 (A) does not adhere to a controller’s instructions to process the
15 personal data; or
16 (B) begins at any point to determine the purposes and means for
17 processing the personal data, alone or in concert with another person.

4 ACTIVITIES THAT PRESENT A HEIGHTENED RISK OF HARM
5 TO A CONSUMER
6 (a) A controller shall conduct and document a data protection assessment
7 for each of the controller’s processing activities that presents a heightened risk

9 (1) the processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted
10 advertising;
11 (2) the sale of personal data;

5 transferred to third parties; and
6 (B) identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and
7 indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other
8 stakeholders, and the public against the potential risks to the consumer
9 associated with the processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can be
10 employed by the controller to reduce the risks.
11 (2) The controller shall factor into any data protection assessment the
12 use of de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well
13 as the context of the processing and the relationship between the controller and
14 the consumer whose personal data will be processed.
15 (c)(1) The Attorney General may require that a controller disclose any data
16 protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the
17 Attorney General pursuant to section 2424 of this title, and the controller shall

1 (3) Data protection assessments shall be confidential and shall be
2 exempt from disclosure and copying under the Public Records Act.
3 (4) To the extent any information contained in a data protection
4 assessment disclosed to the Attorney General includes information subject to
5 attorney-client privilege or work product protection, the disclosure shall not
6 constitute a waiver of the privilege or protection.
7 (d) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of
8 processing operations that present a similar heightened risk of harm.
9 (e) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of
10 complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection
11 assessment shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements established in this
12 section if the data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and
13 effect to the data protection assessment that would otherwise be conducted
14 pursuant to this section.
15 (f) A controller shall update the data protection assessment as often as
16 appropriate considering the type, amount, and sensitivity of personal data
17 collected or processed and level of risk presented by the processing throughout
18 the processing activity’s lifecycle in order to:
19 (1) monitor for harm caused by the processing and adjust safeguards
20 accordingly; and
VT LEG #378938 v.1

11 specific consumer who is the subject of the personal data or associate the
12 personal data with other personal data about the same specific consumer.

14 reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any contractual commitments
15 to which the de-identified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to
