1 (3) These stations operate with small budgets, primarily relying on
2 volunteer staff and listener donations, and are ineligible for federal funding
3 through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting due to their size.
4 (4) Upcoming FCC-approved stations in Bristol, Richmond-Underhill-
5 Jericho, and Ludlow will expand coverage to nearly all Vermont counties,
6 increasing statewide accessibility to vital community radio services.
7 (5) Investment in these stations strengthens Vermont’s public safety
8 network and promotes civic engagement by providing local, hyper-focused
9 content that commercial and statewide media cannot replicate.
10 (b) Intent. The intent of this section is to ensure Vermont’s community
11 radio stations remain resilient and prepared to serve as lifelines during
12 emergencies while fostering local engagement and preserving Vermont’s
13 unique community fabric.
14 (c) Grant program.
15 (1) The Vermont Community Radio Grant Program is established to
16 provide one-time funding to community radio stations for the purpose of:
17 (A) upgrading equipment and infrastructure necessary for reliable
18 emergency broadcasting;
19 (B) procuring and installing backup generators; and
20 (C) enhancing operational sustainability through software
21 improvements and technical training.
