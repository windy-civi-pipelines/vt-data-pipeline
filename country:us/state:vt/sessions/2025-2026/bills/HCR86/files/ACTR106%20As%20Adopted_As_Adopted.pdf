Whereas, the winter of 2025 proved propitious for the Solons girls’ Nordic skiers as
they dashed and glided their way to glory, and
Whereas, this confident and skilled contingent of snowy trail enthusiasts was
exceptionally well prepared, having earned second place in each of the prior two
years, and
Whereas, the two-day skiing competition consisted of the first day’s freestyle runs
held in Craftsbury and the concluding day’s classical racing at Prospect Mountain, at
which Montpelier emerged as the day’s winner, and
Whereas, when all the scores were tallied, the Solons had clinched the 2025 Nordic
skiing title, and the delighted Montpelier skiers were Phoebe Bakeman, Sara Saligman
McGill, Anna Newara, Adele Pritchard, Clare Pritchard, Miriam Serota-Winston, Marie
Voisin, and Anna Wetherell, and
Whereas, Head Coach Brian Carlson and assistant coaches Jason Serota-Winston and
Hugh Pritchard were proud of the team, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2025 Montpelier High School Solons
Division II girls’ Nordic championship ski team, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Montpelier High School.
