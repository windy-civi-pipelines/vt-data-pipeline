House concurrent resolution congratulating the Mount Anthony Union High School Patriot wrestling
program on winning its 36th consecutive State championship
Whereas, the saga of Mount Anthony’s generation of wrestling excellence is truly legendary in the
annals of interscholastic athletic competition in Vermont, and
Whereas, at the 2025 State championship tournament conducted at the Barre Auditorium, the tension
remained high until the day’s conclusion, as the Patriots and the Middlebury Tigers were tied at 199
points with only eight final bouts remaining, and
Whereas, in the decisive moments that followed, Mount Anthony regained the lead after a Patriot
pinned a Springfield wrestler and an Essex106-pound-class wrestler outlasted a Middlebury Tiger,
sealing a Patriot 211.5–199 win over its Addison County rival, and
Whereas, the thrilled Mount Anthony wrestlers, who also clinched the 150-and 132-pound weight
classes, were Sylas Race, Vincent Deysenroth, Dominic Myers, Joel Pacher, Duncan Harrington, Asa
Reis, Carter Tifft, Tyler Monick, Spencer Boucher, Peddie Jenkins, Landon Jarvis, James Murphy,
Aiden Riordan, Ian Denue, and Ryan Marsden, and
Whereas, Head Coach Frank Gaudette, with the great support of assistant coaches Corey Greene,
John Bushee, Scott Legacy Jr., Ken Volkmer, Chris Glaski, and Scott Frost, and Team Manager Addison
Crowley, enabled the Patriots to maximize their wrestling prowess, and
Whereas, later, at the New England Championships held in Providence, Rhode Island, a Patriot
placed fourth in the 138-pound class, marking the first time in the past three seasons that a Mount
Anthony wrestler has earned a podium appearance at the regional tournament, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the Mount Anthony Union High School Patriot wrestling
program on winning its 36th consecutive State championship, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to Mount Anthony
Union High School.
