High School Patriot wrestling program on winning its 36th consecutive State
championship.
(H.C.R.84)
Offered by Representatives Morrissey of Bennington, Cooper of Pownal, Corcoran of
Bennington, Durfee of Shaftsbury, Greer of Bennington, and Nigro of Bennington
Offered by Senators Bongartz and Plunkett
Whereas, the saga of Mount Anthony’s generation of wrestling excellence is truly
legendary in the annals of interscholastic athletic competition in Vermont, and
Whereas, at the 2025 State championship tournament conducted at the Barre
Auditorium, the tension remained high until the day’s conclusion, as the Patriots and the
Middlebury Tigers were tied at 199 points with only eight final bouts remaining, and
Whereas, in the decisive moments that followed, Mount Anthony regained the lead
after a Patriot pinned a Springfield wrestler and an Essex 106-pound-class wrestler
outlasted a Middlebury Tiger, sealing a Patriot 211.5–199 win over its Addison County
rival, and
Whereas, the thrilled Mount Anthony wrestlers, who also clinched the 150- and 132-
pound weight classes, were Sylas Race, Vincent Deysenroth, Dominic Myers, Joel
Pacher, Duncan Harrington, Asa Reis, Carter Tifft, Tyler Monick, Spencer Boucher,
Peddie Jenkins, Landon Jarvis, James Murphy, Aiden Riordan, Ian Denue, and Ryan
Marsden, and
Whereas, Head Coach Frank Gaudette, with the great support of assistant coaches
Corey Greene, John Bushee, Scott Legacy Jr., Ken Volkmer, Chris Glaski, and Scott
Frost, and Team Manager Addison Crowley, enabled the Patriots to maximize their
wrestling prowess, and
Whereas, later, at the New England Championships held in Providence, Rhode Island,
a Patriot placed fourth in the 138-pound class, marking the first time in the past three
seasons that a Mount Anthony wrestler has earned a podium appearance at the regional
tournament, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the Mount Anthony Union High School
Patriot wrestling program on winning its 36th consecutive State championship, and be it
further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Mount Anthony Union High School.
