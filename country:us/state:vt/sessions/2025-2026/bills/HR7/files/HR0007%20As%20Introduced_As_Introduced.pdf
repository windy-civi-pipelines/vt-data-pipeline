House resolution reaffirming the friendship between the State of Vermont
and Taiwan and supporting enhanced Vermont-Taiwan bilateral relations and
Taiwan’s participation in international organizations
Whereas, the United States and the Republic of China (Taiwan) share a
vibrant, mutually beneficial bilateral relationship based on our common values
of freedom and a free-market economy, and the relationship is as strong as it
has ever been, and
Whereas, the January 2024 election of Dr. Lai Ching-te as the President of
Taiwan demonstrates the vibrancy of Taiwan’s democracy, and
Whereas, the United States is Taiwan’s second-largest trading partner and
Taiwan is the United States’ seventh-largest trading partner; in 2024, the two-
way trade in goods between the United States and Taiwan totaled in excess of
$157 billion; and the United States is also the largest supplier of agricultural
products to Taiwan, and
Whereas, in 2022, the United States and Taiwan launched, and in 2023
signed, the U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st Century Trade, which, in part, “is
intended to develop concrete ways to deepen the economic and trade
relationship,” and the first agreement under the Initiative became effective in
December 2024, and
Whereas, Taiwan is the second-largest export destination for Vermont
goods, worth approximately $254 million, and Vermont imported an estimated
$55.3 million in goods from Taiwan, and

Whereas, the Government of Taiwan has expressed a desire to reach an
avoidance of double taxation agreement with the United States, which could
increase Vermont’s exports to Taiwan, bilateral investment, and jobs in
Vermont, and
Whereas, Vermont and Taiwan have enjoyed a long history of productive
bilateral relations, including entering into a driver’s license reciprocity
agreement in 2020, and the Government of Taiwan desires to establish a
memorandum of understanding with the State of Vermont to further increase
educational exchanges and cooperation, and
Whereas, United States policy toward Taiwan is not based on United
Nations Resolution 2758 of 1971, but rather the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979,
which “provides for the continued membership of the people on Taiwan in any
international financial institution or any other international organization,” and
Whereas, Taiwan’s participation and contributions in international
organizations, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization, the World
Health Organization, and the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change would greatly benefit both the United States and the
international community, now therefore be it
Resolved by the House of Representatives:
That this legislative body reaffirms the friendship between the State of
Vermont and Taiwan and supports enhanced Vermont-Taiwan bilateral
relations and Taiwan’s participation in international organizations, and be it
further
Resolved: That the Clerk of the House be directed to send a copy of this
resolution to President Donald J. Trump, President Lai Ching-te of the
Republic of China (Taiwan), Director-General Charles Liao of the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office in Boston, Governor Philip B. Scott, and the
Vermont Congressional Delegation.
