5 Date:
6 Subject: Public service; energy; energy storage; community resilience
7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to direct the
8 State’s electric distribution utilities and Vermont Electric Power Company
9 (VELCO) to submit to the Department of Public Service a report, including an
10 electric system map, identifying where energy storage facilities and flexible
11 load management initiatives, and how much of each solution, would deliver the
12 greatest reliability, affordability, community resilience, and sustainability
13 benefits, which would then be used by the Clean Energy Development Board
14 to award grants to those locations.
15 An act relating to a plan on energy storage development
16 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:
17 Sec. 1. 30 V.S.A. § 8017 is added to read:
18 § 8017. ENERGY RESILIENCY PLAN AND MAP
19 (a) On or before December 31, 2026, in order to develop a plan to help
20 develop energy storage assets and flexible load solutions and address repeated
VT LEG #379347 v.1

1 issues with the electric grid, Vermont’s distribution and transmission utilities
2 shall develop and submit a report, including a map, establishing where storage
3 assets and flexible load management initiatives, and how much of each
4 solution, have the greatest potential to mitigate, resolve, or forestall
5 distribution grid and transmission grid reliability, affordability, community
6 resiliency, and sustainability issues. This report shall utilize all relevant utility,
7 State, and regional system reliability data and projected load growth and
8 community health indicator data to identify where public and private fund
9 investments will deliver the greatest value. This report and map shall be used
10 as a guide for where best to site energy storage facilities and direct flexible
11 load initiatives and will estimate the type and amount of each energy solution.
12 (b) The report shall also:
13 (1) provide a reasonable cost-benefit analysis that presents a general
14 quantification of the value of the return on the dollars invested in energy
15 storage assets and flexible load management initiatives, including benefits of
16 responsible investments and associated returns, financial and nonfinancial, to
17 ratepayers from the provision of services, including energy price arbitrage,
18 capacity, ancillary services, and transmission and distribution asset deferral or
19 substitution;
20 (2) direct long-term investment returns to ratepayers that deploy energy
21 storage systems and leverage flexible load management capabilities;

1 (3) improve the ability to integrate renewable resources at the local,
2 State, and regional level;
3 (4) improve reliability and power quality;
4 (5) estimate the effect on retail electric rates over the life of a given
5 energy storage system compared to the effect on retail electric rates using a
6 nonenergy storage system alternative over the life of the nonenergy storage
7 system alternative;
8 (6) identify utility service territories or communities or buildings where
9 adding energy storage assets would provide a major enhanced reliability
10 benefit, including helping to keep a hospital, community center, warming
11 shelter, emergency response facility, or other key building or buildings online
12 during an outage;
13 (7) identify areas with significant existing grid constraints for
14 electrification and for distribution generation;
15 (8) estimate reduced greenhouse gas emissions; and
16 (9) estimate economic development benefits.
17 (c) The Department shall collaborate, as necessary, in the development of
18 the plan with electric and efficiency utilities, Vermont Electric Power
19 Company (VELCO), regional planning commissions, and energy and
20 environmental organizations and shall integrate the report and map findings
VT LEG #379347 v.1

1 into existing required energy plans and present it to the Climate Council for
2 inclusion in the Climate Action Plan.
3 (d) The Department may require stakeholders to sign confidentiality
4 agreements to address any confidential and proprietary information; however,
5 the map shall be made available to relevant stakeholders involved in energy
6 storage and flexible load management.
7 (e) The Department shall submit the report and map to the Public Utility
8 Commission and, to the degree that energy security allows, the General
9 Assembly, identifying those areas with energy storage assets and flexible load
10 management initiatives, including how much of each type of resource could
11 deliver the greatest reliability, affordability, community resiliency, and
12 sustainability value, including the associated quantitative and qualitative
13 benefits with different investment and deployment scenarios.
14 (f) The plan shall be updated biennially. Future revisions of the plan shall
15 include review of the Municipal Energy Resilience Program assessment,
16 VELCO’s Long-Range Transmission Plan, the environmental justice mapping
17 tool, distribution utility integrated resource plans, efficiency utility demand
18 response plans, and other relevant data.
19 (g) The Clean Energy Development Board shall use the energy resiliency
20 plan as a guide to award grants for the development of energy storage facilities
21 in the identified locations.
