16 Sec. E.127 32 V.S.A. § 704 is amended to read:
17 § 704. INTERIM BUDGET AND APPROPRIATION ADJUSTMENTS
18 (a) The General Assembly recognizes that acts of appropriations and their
19 sources of funding reflect the priorities for expenditures of public funds
20 enacted by the General Assembly and that major reductions or transfers, when
21 required by reduced State revenues or other reasons, ought to be made
VT LEG #382260 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.493
2025 Page 125 of 192
1 whenever possible by an act of the General Assembly reflecting its revisions of
2 those priorities. Nevertheless, the General Assembly also recognizes that
3 when it is not in session, it may be necessary to reduce authorized
4 appropriations and their sources of funding, and funds may need to be
5 transferred, to maintain a balanced State budget. Under these limited
6 circumstances, it is the intent of the General Assembly that appropriations may
7 be reduced and funds transferred when the General Assembly is not in session
8 pursuant to the provisions of this section.
9 (b)(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this section, in
10 each instance that the official State revenue estimate for the General Fund, the
11 Transportation Fund, or federal funds has been reduced by one percent or more
12 from the estimates determined and assumed for purposes of the current fiscal
13 year’s appropriations, the Secretary of Administration shall prepare an
14 expenditure reduction plan for consideration and approval by the Joint Fiscal
15 Committee pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, provided that any total
16 reductions in appropriations and transfers of funds are not greater than the
17 reductions in the official State revenue estimate.
18 (2) In each instance that the official State revenue estimate for the
19 General Fund, the Transportation Fund, or federal funds has been reduced by
20 less than one percent from the estimates determined and assumed for purposes
21 of the current fiscal year’s appropriations, the Secretary of Administration may
VT LEG #382260 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.493
2025 Page 126 of 192
1 prepare and implement an expenditure reduction plan without the approval of
2 the Joint Fiscal Committee, provided that any total reductions in appropriations
3 and transfers of funds are not greater than the reductions in the official State
4 revenue estimate. The Secretary may implement an expenditure reduction plan
5 under this subdivision if plan reductions to the total amount appropriated in
6 any section or subsection do not exceed five percent, the plan is designed to
7 minimize any negative effects on the delivery of services to the public, and the
8 plan does not have any unduly disproportionate effect on any single function,
9 program, service, benefit, or county. Plans not requiring the approval of the
10 Joint Fiscal Committee shall be filed with the Joint Fiscal Office prior to
11 implementation. If the Secretary’s plan consists of reductions greater than five
12 percent to the total amount appropriated in any section or subsection, such plan
13 shall only be implemented in the manner provided for in subdivision (1) of this
14 subsection.
15 (3) In each instance that a reduction of federal funds results in a one
16 percent or more reduction in the total federal funds anticipated in the most
17 recent fiscal year appropriations act:
18 (A) the Secretary of Administration shall prepare an expenditure
19 reduction and transfer plan for consideration and approval by the Joint Fiscal
20 Committee pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, provided that any total
VT LEG #382260 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.493
2025 Page 127 of 192
1 reductions in appropriations and transfers of funds are not greater than the
2 reductions in federal funds; and
3 (B) to maintain a balanced State budget, minimize the impact to
4 Vermonters and to abide by the legislative intent set forth by the General
5 Assembly in the most recent appropriations act, the Joint Fiscal Committee
6 may make a recommendation to the Emergency Board to:
7 (i) pursuant to subdivision 308c(b)(3) of this title, utilize the
8 General Fund Balance Reserve to support impacted programs at not more than
9 the current fiscal year funding level until the General Assembly is in session;
10 (ii) revert any unexpended and unobligated funds or abolish any
11 spending authority, or both; and
12 (iii) make such reductions or transfers in appropriations necessary
13 to support the priorities of the General Assembly, and the recommended
14 reduction is limited to not more than 10 percent of any fund or 10 percent of
15 any appropriation.
16 (4) In each instance that a reduction of federal funds results in a five
17 percent or more reduction in the total funds available to support an
18 appropriation, the Secretary of Administration shall notify the Joint Fiscal
19 Committee.

15 Assembly that any General Fund Balance Reserve funds utilized in accordance

17 § 704. INTERIM BUDGET AND APPROPRIATION ADJUSTMENTS
18 (a) The General Assembly recognizes that acts of appropriations and their
19 sources of funding reflect the priorities for expenditures of public funds
20 enacted by the General Assembly and that major reductions or transfers, when
21 required by reduced State revenues or other reasons, ought to be made
VT LEG #382260 v.1

AS PASSED BY HOUSE H.493
2025 Page 125 of 192
1 whenever possible by an act of the General Assembly reflecting its revisions of
2 those priorities. Nevertheless, the General Assembly also recognizes that
3 when it is not in session, it may be necessary to reduce authorized
4 appropriations and their sources of funding, and funds may need to be
5 transferred, to maintain a balanced State budget. Under these limited
6 circumstances, it is the intent of the General Assembly that appropriations may
7 be reduced and funds transferred when the General Assembly is not in session
8 pursuant to the provisions of this section.
9 (b)(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this section, in
10 each instance that the official State revenue estimate for the General Fund, the
11 Transportation Fund, or federal funds has been reduced by one percent or more
12 from the estimates determined and assumed for purposes of the current fiscal
13 year’s appropriations, the Secretary of Administration shall prepare an
14 expenditure reduction plan for consideration and approval by the Joint Fiscal
15 Committee pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, provided that any total
16 reductions in appropriations and transfers of funds are not greater than the
17 reductions in the official State revenue estimate.
18 (2) In each instance that the official State revenue estimate for the
19 General Fund, the Transportation Fund, or federal funds has been reduced by
20 less than one percent from the estimates determined and assumed for purposes
21 of the current fiscal year’s appropriations, the Secretary of Administration may

1 prepare and implement an expenditure reduction plan without the approval of
2 the Joint Fiscal Committee, provided that any total reductions in appropriations
3 and transfers of funds are not greater than the reductions in the official State
4 revenue estimate. The Secretary may implement an expenditure reduction plan
5 under this subdivision if plan reductions to the total amount appropriated in
6 any section or subsection do not exceed five percent, the plan is designed to
7 minimize any negative effects on the delivery of services to the public, and the
8 plan does not have any unduly disproportionate effect on any single function,
9 program, service, benefit, or county. Plans not requiring the approval of the
10 Joint Fiscal Committee shall be filed with the Joint Fiscal Office prior to
11 implementation. If the Secretary’s plan consists of reductions greater than five
12 percent to the total amount appropriated in any section or subsection, such plan
13 shall only be implemented in the manner provided for in subdivision (1) of this
14 subsection.
15 (3) In each instance that a reduction of federal funds results in a one
16 percent or more reduction in the total federal funds anticipated in the most
17 recent fiscal year appropriations act:
18 (A) the Secretary of Administration shall prepare an expenditure
19 reduction and transfer plan for consideration and approval by the Joint Fiscal
20 Committee pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, provided that any total

3 (B) to maintain a balanced State budget, minimize the impact to
4 Vermonters and to abide by the legislative intent set forth by the General
5 Assembly in the most recent appropriations act, the Joint Fiscal Committee
6 may make a recommendation to the Emergency Board to:
7 (i) pursuant to subdivision 308c(b)(3) of this title, utilize the
8 General Fund Balance Reserve to support impacted programs at not more than
9 the current fiscal year funding level until the General Assembly is in session;
10 (ii) revert any unexpended and unobligated funds or abolish any
11 spending authority, or both; and
12 (iii) make such reductions or transfers in appropriations necessary
13 to support the priorities of the General Assembly, and the recommended
14 reduction is limited to not more than 10 percent of any fund or 10 percent of
15 any appropriation.
16 (4) In each instance that a reduction of federal funds results in a five
17 percent or more reduction in the total funds available to support an
