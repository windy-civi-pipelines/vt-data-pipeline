1 (a) It is the intent of the General Assembly that of the General Fund
2 appropriation in Sec. B.126 of this act, $1,500,000 be for expenses including
3 meetings of the General Assembly not budgeted for in prior, current, or future
4 appropriations acts. It is further the intent of the General Assembly that the
5 proposed fiscal year 2027 General Assembly budget exclude this $1,500,000
6 from any calculation of its base appropriation amount.
7 Sec. E.127 32 V.S.A. § 704 is amended to read:
8 § 704. INTERIM BUDGET AND APPROPRIATION ADJUSTMENTS
9 (a) The General Assembly recognizes that acts of appropriations and their
10 sources of funding reflect the priorities for expenditures of public funds
11 enacted by the General Assembly and that major reductions or transfers, when
12 required by reduced State revenues or other reasons, ought to be made
13 whenever possible by an act of the General Assembly reflecting its revisions of
14 those priorities. Nevertheless, the General Assembly also recognizes that
15 when it is not in session, it may be necessary to reduce authorized
16 appropriations and their sources of funding, and funds may need to be
17 transferred, to maintain a balanced State budget. Under these limited
18 circumstances, it is the intent of the General Assembly that appropriations may
19 be reduced and funds transferred when the General Assembly is not in session
20 pursuant to the provisions of this section.

1 (b)(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this section, in
2 each instance that the official State revenue estimate for the General Fund, the
3 Transportation Fund, or federal funds has been reduced by one percent or more
4 from the estimates determined and assumed for purposes of the current fiscal
5 year’s appropriations, the Secretary of Administration shall prepare an
6 expenditure reduction plan for consideration and approval by the Joint Fiscal
7 Committee pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, provided that any total
8 reductions in appropriations and transfers of funds are not greater than the
9 reductions in the official State revenue estimate.
10 (2) In each instance that the official State revenue estimate for the
11 General Fund, the Transportation Fund, or federal funds has been reduced by
12 less than one percent from the estimates determined and assumed for purposes
13 of the current fiscal year’s appropriations, the Secretary of Administration may
14 prepare and implement an expenditure reduction plan without the approval of
15 the Joint Fiscal Committee, provided that any total reductions in appropriations
16 and transfers of funds are not greater than the reductions in the official State
17 revenue estimate. The Secretary may implement an expenditure reduction plan
18 under this subdivision if plan reductions to the total amount appropriated in
19 any section or subsection do not exceed five percent, the plan is designed to
20 minimize any negative effects on the delivery of services to the public, and the
21 plan does not have any unduly disproportionate effect on any single function,
