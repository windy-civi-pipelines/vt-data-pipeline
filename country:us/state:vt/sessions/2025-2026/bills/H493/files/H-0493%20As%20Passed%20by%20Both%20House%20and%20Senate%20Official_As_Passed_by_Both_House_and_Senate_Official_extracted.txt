15 Sec. E.127 32 V.S.A. § 704 is amended to read:
16 § 704. INTERIM BUDGET AND APPROPRIATION ADJUSTMENTS
17 (a) The General Assembly recognizes that acts of appropriations and their
18 sources of funding reflect the priorities for expenditures of public funds
19 enacted by the General Assembly and that major reductions or transfers, when
20 required by reduced State revenues or other reasons, ought to be made
21 whenever possible by an act of the General Assembly reflecting its revisions of
BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE AND SENATE H.493
2025 Page 125 of 480
1 those priorities. Nevertheless, the General Assembly also recognizes that
2 when it is not in session, it may be necessary to reduce authorized
3 appropriations and their sources of funding, and funds may need to be
4 transferred, to maintain a balanced State budget. Under these limited
5 circumstances, it is the intent of the General Assembly that appropriations may
6 be reduced and funds transferred when the General Assembly is not in session
7 pursuant to the provisions of this section.
8 (b)(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this section, in
9 each instance that the official State revenue estimate for the General Fund, the
10 Transportation Fund, or federal funds has been reduced by one percent or more
11 from the estimates determined and assumed for purposes of the current fiscal
12 year’s appropriations, the Secretary of Administration shall prepare an
13 expenditure reduction plan for consideration and approval by the Joint Fiscal
14 Committee pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, provided that any total
15 reductions in appropriations and transfers of funds are not greater than the
16 reductions in the official State revenue estimate.
17 (2) In each instance that the official State revenue estimate for the
18 General Fund, the Transportation Fund, or federal funds has been reduced by
19 less than one percent from the estimates determined and assumed for purposes
20 of the current fiscal year’s appropriations, the Secretary of Administration may
21 prepare and implement an expenditure reduction plan without the approval of
BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE AND SENATE H.493
2025 Page 126 of 480
1 the Joint Fiscal Committee, provided that any total reductions in
2 appropriations and transfers of funds are not greater than the reductions in the
3 official State revenue estimate. The Secretary may implement an expenditure
4 reduction plan under this subdivision if plan reductions to the total amount
5 appropriated in any section or subsection do not exceed five percent, the plan
6 is designed to minimize any negative effects on the delivery of services to the
7 public, and the plan does not have any unduly disproportionate effect on any
8 single function, program, service, benefit, or county. Plans not requiring the
9 approval of the Joint Fiscal Committee shall be filed with the Joint Fiscal
10 Office prior to implementation. If the Secretary’s plan consists of reductions
11 greater than five percent to the total amount appropriated in any section or
12 subsection, such plan shall only be implemented in the manner provided for in
13 subdivision (1) of this subsection.
14 (3) In each instance that a reduction of federal funds results in a one
15 percent or more reduction in the total federal funds anticipated in the most
16 recent fiscal year appropriations act:
17 (A) the Secretary of Administration shall prepare an expenditure
18 reduction and transfer plan for consideration and approval by the Joint Fiscal
19 Committee pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, provided that any total
20 reductions in appropriations and transfers of funds are not greater than the
21 reductions in federal funds; and

1 (B) to maintain a balanced State budget, minimize the impact to
2 Vermonters and to abide by the legislative intent set forth by the General
3 Assembly in the most recent appropriations act, the Joint Fiscal Committee
4 may make a recommendation to the Emergency Board to:
5 (i) pursuant to subdivision 308c(b)(3) of this title, utilize the
6 General Fund Balance Reserve to support impacted programs at not more than
7 the current fiscal year funding level until the General Assembly is in session;
8 (ii) revert any unexpended and unobligated funds or abolish any
9 spending authority, or both; and
10 (iii) make such reductions or transfers in appropriations necessary
11 to support the priorities of the General Assembly, and the recommended
12 reduction is limited to not more than 10 percent of any fund or 10 percent of
13 any appropriation.
14 (4) In each instance that a reduction of federal funds results in a five
15 percent or more reduction in the total funds available to support an
16 appropriation, the Secretary of Administration shall notify the Joint Fiscal
17 Committee.

9 the use of up to 50 percent of the amounts added in the prior fiscal year from

11 Reserve to fund unforeseen or emergency needs. It is the intent of the General
12 Assembly that any General Fund Balance Reserve funds utilized in accordance
13 with this section be replenished.
14 (2) If the official State revenue estimates of the Emergency Board for
15 the General Fund, determined under section 305a of this title, have been
16 reduced by two percent or more from the estimates determined and assumed
17 for purposes of the general appropriations act or budget adjustment act, funds
18 in the General Fund Balance Reserve may be unreserved and appropriated or
19 transferred to compensate for a reduction of revenues.
20 (3) The Emergency Board, in response to a declared emergency

3 in session, may unreserve and make available an amount not to exceed 10
4 percent of the General Fund Balance Reserve to replenish the spending
5 authority impacted by the declared emergency or reduction in funding in order
6 to maintain a balanced State budget, minimize the impact to Vermonters, and

8 recent fiscal year appropriations act. In no event shall the amount provided to
9 any agency or department under this subsection exceed the original amount
10 appropriated by the General Assembly.
11 (c) There is hereby created within the Transportation Fund a Transportation
12 Fund Balance Reserve. After satisfying the requirements of section 308a of

Section 8:
§ 704. INTERIM BUDGET AND APPROPRIATION ADJUSTMENTS
(a) The General Assembly recognizes that acts of appropriations and their
sources of funding reflect the priorities for expenditures of public funds
enacted by the General Assembly and that major reductions or transfers, when
required by reduced State revenues or other reasons, ought to be made
whenever possible by an act of the General Assembly reflecting its revisions of
those priorities. Nevertheless, the General Assembly also recognizes that when
it is not in session, it may be necessary to reduce authorized appropriations
and their sources of funding, and funds may need to be transferred, to maintain
a balanced State budget. Under these limited circumstances, it is the intent of
BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE AND SENATE H.493
2025 Page 335 of 480
the General Assembly that appropriations may be reduced and funds
transferred when the General Assembly is not in session pursuant to the
provisions of this section.
(b)(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this section, in each
instance that the official State revenue estimate for the General Fund, the
Transportation Fund, or federal funds has been reduced by one percent or
more from the estimates determined and assumed for purposes of the current
fiscal year’s appropriations, the Secretary of Administration shall prepare an
expenditure reduction plan for consideration and approval by the Joint Fiscal
Committee pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, provided that any total
reductions in appropriations and transfers of funds are not greater than the
reductions in the official State revenue estimate.
(2) In each instance that the official State revenue estimate for the
General Fund, the Transportation Fund, or federal funds has been reduced by
less than one percent from the estimates determined and assumed for purposes
of the current fiscal year’s appropriations, the Secretary of Administration may
prepare and implement an expenditure reduction plan without the approval of
the Joint Fiscal Committee, provided that any total reductions in
appropriations and transfers of funds are not greater than the reductions in the
official State revenue estimate. The Secretary may implement an expenditure
reduction plan under this subdivision if plan reductions to the total amount
BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE AND SENATE H.493
2025 Page 336 of 480
appropriated in any section or subsection do not exceed five percent, the plan
is designed to minimize any negative effects on the delivery of services to the
public, and the plan does not have any unduly disproportionate effect on any
single function, program, service, benefit, or county. Plans not requiring the
approval of the Joint Fiscal Committee shall be filed with the Joint Fiscal
Office prior to implementation. If the Secretary’s plan consists of reductions
greater than five percent to the total amount appropriated in any section or
subsection, such plan shall only be implemented in the manner provided for in
subdivision (1) of this subsection.

(b)(1) The General Assembly may specifically unreserve and appropriate
the use of up to 50 percent of the amounts added in the prior fiscal year from
or transfer an amount not to exceed 10 percent of the General Fund Balance
Reserve to fund unforeseen or emergency needs. It is the intent of the General
Assembly that any General Fund Balance Reserve funds utilized in accordance
with this section be replenished.
(2) If the official State revenue estimates of the Emergency Board for the
General Fund, determined under section 305a of this title, have been reduced

(2) “Governmental function unit” refers to the governmental function

(b) In each instance that a reduction in federal revenues to the State results
in a decrease of the unduplicated function total for any governmental function
unit by:
(1) Less than 0.5 percent of the unduplicated function total or
$2,000,000, whichever threshold amount is greater, the Secretary of
Administration shall notify the Joint Fiscal Committee and may prepare and
implement a spending authority reduction plan without the approval of the
Joint Fiscal Committee, provided that any total reductions in appropriations
and transfers of funds are not greater than the reduction in the federal
revenues. If the Secretary’s plan consists of reductions greater than five
percent to the total amount appropriated in any section or subsection of any
appropriations act, such plan shall only be implemented in the manner
provided for in 32 V.S.A. § 704(b)(2).
(2) Greater than $2,000,000 and 0.5 percent of the unduplicated
function total for any governmental function unit, but less than 25 percent or

(B) to maintain a balanced State budget, to minimize the impact to
Vermonters and to abide by the legislative intent set forth by the General
Assembly in this act, the Joint Fiscal Committee may make a recommendation
to the Emergency Board to:

support impacted programs at not more than the current fiscal year funding
level until the General Assembly is in session;
(ii) revert any unexpended and unobligated funds; and
(iii) make such reductions or transfers in appropriations necessary
to support the priorities of the General Assembly.
(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, for the
purpose of calculating any appropriation reduction that triggers the actions set
forth in this section, the baseline federal funding amounts shall be the federal
funding set forth in this act. The Secretary of Administration shall monitor any
changes in federal funding as the difference between the baseline federal
funding amount for use in fiscal year 2026 and any updated State federal funds
revenue forecast adopted by the Emergency Board and shall calculate the

Sec. F.175 DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS; FACILITY WORK
PROGRAMS; STRATEGIC PLAN
(a) Findings and intent.

developed within previously existing programs despite a wage structure that
pays incarcerated individuals in Vermont at rates ranging from $0.25 to $1.35
per hour, significantly below the federal minimum wage.
(2) It is the intent of the General Assembly that all Department of
Corrections facility work programs operate in a manner that is fiscally
sustainable to the extent possible within current statutory limitations and
effective in preparing offenders for meaningful employment upon release.
(b) Strategic plan. On or before December 15, 2025, the Department of
Corrections shall, in consultation with the Department of Labor, submit a
strategic plan with proposed benchmarks for improvement to the House

work programs to determine if those skills are transferable to employment
opportunities post-incarceration. The evaluation shall include consideration
of expanding technical training and certification opportunities that carry
recognized value in the labor market.

serves a sufficient portion of the incarcerated population to justify its
administration. The analysis shall also consider whether participants gain
meaningful and valuable work experiences.

implications of wage structures on program outcomes, and the appropriate use
of funds in relation to program objectives.

16 § 704. INTERIM BUDGET AND APPROPRIATION ADJUSTMENTS
17 (a) The General Assembly recognizes that acts of appropriations and their
18 sources of funding reflect the priorities for expenditures of public funds
19 enacted by the General Assembly and that major reductions or transfers, when
20 required by reduced State revenues or other reasons, ought to be made
21 whenever possible by an act of the General Assembly reflecting its revisions of

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE AND SENATE H.493
2025 Page 125 of 480
1 those priorities. Nevertheless, the General Assembly also recognizes that
2 when it is not in session, it may be necessary to reduce authorized
3 appropriations and their sources of funding, and funds may need to be
4 transferred, to maintain a balanced State budget. Under these limited
5 circumstances, it is the intent of the General Assembly that appropriations may
6 be reduced and funds transferred when the General Assembly is not in session
7 pursuant to the provisions of this section.
8 (b)(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this section, in
9 each instance that the official State revenue estimate for the General Fund, the
10 Transportation Fund, or federal funds has been reduced by one percent or more
11 from the estimates determined and assumed for purposes of the current fiscal
12 year’s appropriations, the Secretary of Administration shall prepare an
13 expenditure reduction plan for consideration and approval by the Joint Fiscal
14 Committee pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, provided that any total
15 reductions in appropriations and transfers of funds are not greater than the
16 reductions in the official State revenue estimate.
17 (2) In each instance that the official State revenue estimate for the
18 General Fund, the Transportation Fund, or federal funds has been reduced by
19 less than one percent from the estimates determined and assumed for purposes
20 of the current fiscal year’s appropriations, the Secretary of Administration may
21 prepare and implement an expenditure reduction plan without the approval of

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE AND SENATE H.493
2025 Page 126 of 480
1 the Joint Fiscal Committee, provided that any total reductions in
2 appropriations and transfers of funds are not greater than the reductions in the
3 official State revenue estimate. The Secretary may implement an expenditure
4 reduction plan under this subdivision if plan reductions to the total amount
5 appropriated in any section or subsection do not exceed five percent, the plan
6 is designed to minimize any negative effects on the delivery of services to the
7 public, and the plan does not have any unduly disproportionate effect on any
8 single function, program, service, benefit, or county. Plans not requiring the
9 approval of the Joint Fiscal Committee shall be filed with the Joint Fiscal
10 Office prior to implementation. If the Secretary’s plan consists of reductions
11 greater than five percent to the total amount appropriated in any section or
12 subsection, such plan shall only be implemented in the manner provided for in
13 subdivision (1) of this subsection.
14 (3) In each instance that a reduction of federal funds results in a one
15 percent or more reduction in the total federal funds anticipated in the most
16 recent fiscal year appropriations act:
17 (A) the Secretary of Administration shall prepare an expenditure
18 reduction and transfer plan for consideration and approval by the Joint Fiscal
19 Committee pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, provided that any total
20 reductions in appropriations and transfers of funds are not greater than the
21 reductions in federal funds; and

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE AND SENATE H.493
2025 Page 127 of 480
1 (B) to maintain a balanced State budget, minimize the impact to
2 Vermonters and to abide by the legislative intent set forth by the General
3 Assembly in the most recent appropriations act, the Joint Fiscal Committee
4 may make a recommendation to the Emergency Board to:
5 (i) pursuant to subdivision 308c(b)(3) of this title, utilize the
6 General Fund Balance Reserve to support impacted programs at not more than
7 the current fiscal year funding level until the General Assembly is in session;
8 (ii) revert any unexpended and unobligated funds or abolish any
9 spending authority, or both; and
10 (iii) make such reductions or transfers in appropriations necessary
11 to support the priorities of the General Assembly, and the recommended
12 reduction is limited to not more than 10 percent of any fund or 10 percent of
13 any appropriation.
14 (4) In each instance that a reduction of federal funds results in a five
15 percent or more reduction in the total funds available to support an
16 appropriation, the Secretary of Administration shall notify the Joint Fiscal
17 Committee.

11 Reserve to fund unforeseen or emergency needs. It is the intent of the General
12 Assembly that any General Fund Balance Reserve funds utilized in accordance
13 with this section be replenished.
14 (2) If the official State revenue estimates of the Emergency Board for
15 the General Fund, determined under section 305a of this title, have been
16 reduced by two percent or more from the estimates determined and assumed
17 for purposes of the general appropriations act or budget adjustment act, funds
18 in the General Fund Balance Reserve may be unreserved and appropriated or
19 transferred to compensate for a reduction of revenues.
20 (3) The Emergency Board, in response to a declared emergency
21 pursuant to 20 V.S.A. § 9 occurring while the General Assembly is not in

4 percent of the General Fund Balance Reserve to replenish the spending
5 authority impacted by the declared emergency or reduction in funding in order

10 appropriated by the General Assembly.

sources of funding reflect the priorities for expenditures of public funds
enacted by the General Assembly and that major reductions or transfers, when
required by reduced State revenues or other reasons, ought to be made
whenever possible by an act of the General Assembly reflecting its revisions of
those priorities. Nevertheless, the General Assembly also recognizes that when
it is not in session, it may be necessary to reduce authorized appropriations
and their sources of funding, and funds may need to be transferred, to maintain
a balanced State budget. Under these limited circumstances, it is the intent of

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE AND SENATE H.493
2025 Page 335 of 480
the General Assembly that appropriations may be reduced and funds
transferred when the General Assembly is not in session pursuant to the

official State revenue estimate. The Secretary may implement an expenditure
reduction plan under this subdivision if plan reductions to the total amount
