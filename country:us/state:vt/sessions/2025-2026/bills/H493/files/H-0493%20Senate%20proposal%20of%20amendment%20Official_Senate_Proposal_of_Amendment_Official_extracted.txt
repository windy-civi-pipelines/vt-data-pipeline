Agency and department heads are directed to implement staffing and service
levels at the beginning of fiscal year 2026 so as to meet this condition unless
otherwise directed by specific language in this act or other acts of the General
Assembly.
(b) It is the intent of the General Assembly that any interim budget and

prioritize supporting the health, safety, and well-being of Vermonters; a robust
education system; and a strong economy.
Sec. A.102 APPROPRIATIONS

from the Capital Infrastructure Subaccount of the Cash Fund for Capital and
Essential Investments Special Fund shall be subject to the provisions of 32

(a) Except as specifically provided, this act shall not be construed in any
way to negate or impair the full force and effect of existing laws.

shall control, notwithstanding receipts being greater or less than anticipated.
Sec. A.106 FEDERALFUNDS
(a) In fiscal year 2026, the Governor, with the approval of the General
Assembly or the Joint Fiscal Committee if the General Assembly is not in
session, may accept federal funds available to the State of Vermont, including
block grants in lieu of, or in addition to, funds herein designated as federal.
The Governor, with the approval of the General Assembly or the Joint Fiscal
Committee if the General Assembly is not in session, may allocate all or any
portion of such federal funds for any purpose consistent with the purposes for
which the basic appropriations in this act have been made.
(b) If, during fiscal year 2026, federal funds available to the State of
Vermont and designated as federal in this and other acts of the 2025 session of
the Vermont General Assembly are converted into block grants or are
abolished under their current title in federal law and reestablished under a new
title in federal law, the Governor may continue to accept such federal funds for
any purpose consistent with the purposes for which the federal funds were
appropriated. The Governor may spend such funds for such purposes for not
more than 45 days prior to General Assembly or Joint Fiscal Committee
approval. Notice shall be given to the Joint Fiscal Committee without delay if
the Governor intends to use the authority granted by this section, and the Joint
Fiscal Committee shall meet in an expedited manner to review the Governor’s
request for approval.
Sec. A.107 NEW POSITIONS
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the total number of
authorized State positions, both classified and exempt, excluding temporary
positions as defined in 3 V.S.A. § 311(a)(11), shall not be increased during

Sec. F.175 DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS; FACILITY WORK
PROGRAMS; STRATEGIC PLAN
(a) Findings and intent.
(1) The General Assembly finds that a significant budget deficit has
developed within previously existing programs despite a wage structure that
pays incarcerated individuals in Vermont at rates ranging from $0.25 to $1.35
per hour, significantly below the federal minimum wage.
(2) It is the intent of the General Assembly that all Department of
Corrections facility work programs operate in a manner that is fiscally
sustainable to the extent possible within current statutory limitations and
effective in preparing offenders for meaningful employment upon release.
(b) Strategic plan. On or before December 15, 2025, the Department of
Corrections shall, in consultation with the Department of Labor, submit a
strategic plan with proposed benchmarks for improvement to the House
Committees on Appropriations and on Corrections and Institutions and the
Senate Committees on Appropriations, on Institutions, and on Judiciary. The
strategic plan shall include:
(1) A business plan to improve program efficiency and self-
sustainability to ensure all facility work programs, including Vermont
Correctional Industries, vocational training programs, and other paid facility
duties, operate without recurring deficits or to clearly identify funding sources
to address the deficits.
(2) A comprehensive evaluation of the skills provided through facility
work programs to determine if those skills are transferable to employment
opportunities post-incarceration. The evaluation shall include consideration of
expanding technical training and certification opportunities that carry
recognized value in the labor market.
(3) An analysis of facility work programs to determine if each program
serves a sufficient portion of the incarcerated population to justify its
administration. The analysis shall also consider whether participants gain
meaningful and valuable work experiences.
(4) A review of wages paid to facility work program participants, the
implications of wage structures on program outcomes, and the appropriate use
of funds in relation to program objectives.
(c) In fiscal years 2025 and 2026, the Department of Corrections shall
submit timely reports to the House Committees on Appropriations and on
Corrections and Institutions and the Senate Committees on Appropriations, on
Institutions, and on Judiciary, or the Joint Fiscal Committee and the Joint
Legislative Justice Oversight Committee when the General Assembly is not in
session, on the development of facility work program deficits. The
Department shall include in these reports any financial or operational actions
taken to address deficits, increase oversight, and prevent future deficits.

An act relating to making appropriations for the support of the government
The Senate proposes to the House to amend the bill by striking out all after
the enacting clause and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
* * * Purpose, Definitions, Legend * * *
Sec. A.100 SHORT TITLE
(a) This bill may be referred to as the “BIG BILL– Fiscal Year 2026
Appropriations Act”.
Sec. A.101 PURPOSE; LEGISLATIVE INTENT
(a) The purpose of this act is to provide appropriations for the operations of
State government and for capital appropriations not funded with bond
proceeds during fiscal year 2026. It is the express intent of the General
Assembly that activities of the various agencies, departments, divisions,
boards, offices, and commissions be limited to those that can be supported by
funds appropriated in this act or other acts passed prior to June 30, 2025.
Agency and department heads are directed to implement staffing and service
levels at the beginning of fiscal year 2026 so as to meet this condition unless
otherwise directed by specific language in this act or other acts of the General
Assembly.
(b) It is the intent of the General Assembly that any interim budget and
appropriation adjustments made in accordance with 32 V.S.A. §§ 133 and 704
prioritize supporting the health, safety, and well-being of Vermonters; a robust
education system; and a strong economy.
Sec. A.102 APPROPRIATIONS
(a) It is the intent of the General Assembly that this act serves as the
primary source and reference for appropriations for the operations of State
government and for capital appropriations not funded with bond proceeds in
fiscal year 2026.
(b) The sums herein stated are appropriated for the purposes specified in
the following sections of this act. When no time is expressly stated during
which any of the operating appropriations are to continue, the appropriations
are single-year appropriations and only for the purpose indicated and shall be
paid from funds shown as the source of funds. Capital appropriations funded
from the Capital Infrastructure Subaccount of the Cash Fund for Capital and
Essential Investments Special Fund shall be subject to the provisions of 32
V.S.A. § 1001b(e). If in this act there is an error in either addition or
subtraction, the totals shall be adjusted accordingly. Apparent errors in

referring to section numbers of statutory titles within this act may be
disregarded by the Commissioner of Finance and Management.
(c) Unless codified or otherwise specified, all narrative portions of this act
apply only to the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2026.
Sec. A.103 DEFINITIONS
(a) As used in this act:
(1) “Encumbrances” means a portion of spending authority reserved for
the subsequent payment of existing travel authorizations, purchase orders,
grants, or contracts. The Commissioner of Finance and Management shall
make final decisions on the appropriateness of encumbrances.
(2) “Grants” means subsidies, aid, or payments to local governments, to
community and quasi-public agencies for providing local services, and to
persons who are not wards of the State for services or supplies and means cash
or other direct assistance, including pension contributions.
(3) “Operating expenses” means property management; repair and
maintenance; rental expenses; insurance; postage; travel; energy and utilities;
office and other supplies; equipment, including motor vehicles, highway
materials, and construction; expenditures for the purchase of land and
construction of new buildings and permanent improvements; and similar items.
(4) “Personal services” means wages and salaries, fringe benefits, per
diems, contracted third-party services, and similar items.
(5) “Capital appropriation” means an appropriation for tangible capital
investments or expenses that are eligible to be funded from general obligation
debt financing and are allowed under federal laws governing the use of State
bond proceeds as described in 32 V.S.A. § 309.
Sec. A.104 RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING LAWS
(a) Except as specifically provided, this act shall not be construed in any
way to negate or impair the full force and effect of existing laws.
Sec. A.105 OFFSETTING APPROPRIATIONS
(a) In the absence of specific provisions to the contrary in this act, when
total appropriations are offset by estimated receipts, the State appropriations
shall control, notwithstanding receipts being greater or less than anticipated.
Sec. A.106 FEDERALFUNDS
(a) In fiscal year 2026, the Governor, with the approval of the General
Assembly or the Joint Fiscal Committee if the General Assembly is not in
session, may accept federal funds available to the State of Vermont, including
block grants in lieu of, or in addition to, funds herein designated as federal.

The Governor, with the approval of the General Assembly or the Joint Fiscal
Committee if the General Assembly is not in session, may allocate all or any
portion of such federal funds for any purpose consistent with the purposes for
which the basic appropriations in this act have been made.
(b) If, during fiscal year 2026, federal funds available to the State of
Vermont and designated as federal in this and other acts of the 2025 session of
the Vermont General Assembly are converted into block grants or are
abolished under their current title in federal law and reestablished under a new
title in federal law, the Governor may continue to accept such federal funds for
any purpose consistent with the purposes for which the federal funds were
appropriated. The Governor may spend such funds for such purposes for not
more than 45 days prior to General Assembly or Joint Fiscal Committee
approval. Notice shall be given to the Joint Fiscal Committee without delay if
the Governor intends to use the authority granted by this section, and the Joint
Fiscal Committee shall meet in an expedited manner to review the Governor’s
request for approval.
Sec. A.107 NEW POSITIONS
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the total number of
authorized State positions, both classified and exempt, excluding temporary
positions as defined in 3 V.S.A. § 311(a)(11), shall not be increased during
fiscal year 2026 except for new positions authorized by the General Assembly
during the 2025 session. Limited service positions approved pursuant to 32
V.S.A. § 5 shall not be subject to this restriction.

Sec. E.127 32 V.S.A. § 704 is amended to read:
§ 704. INTERIM BUDGET AND APPROPRIATION ADJUSTMENTS
(a) The General Assembly recognizes that acts of appropriations and their
sources of funding reflect the priorities for expenditures of public funds
enacted by the General Assembly and that major reductions or transfers, when

required by reduced State revenues or other reasons, ought to be made
whenever possible by an act of the General Assembly reflecting its revisions of
those priorities. Nevertheless, the General Assembly also recognizes that
when it is not in session, it may be necessary to reduce authorized
appropriations and their sources of funding, and funds may need to be
transferred, to maintain a balanced State budget. Under these limited
circumstances, it is the intent of the General Assembly that appropriations may
be reduced and funds transferred when the General Assembly is not in session
pursuant to the provisions of this section.
(b)(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this section, in
each instance that the official State revenue estimate for the General Fund, the
Transportation Fund, or federal funds has been reduced by one percent or more
from the estimates determined and assumed for purposes of the current fiscal
year’s appropriations, the Secretary of Administration shall prepare an
expenditure reduction plan for consideration and approval by the Joint Fiscal
Committee pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, provided that any total
reductions in appropriations and transfers of funds are not greater than the
reductions in the official State revenue estimate.
(2) In each instance that the official State revenue estimate for the
General Fund, the Transportation Fund, or federal funds has been reduced by
less than one percent from the estimates determined and assumed for purposes
of the current fiscal year’s appropriations, the Secretary of Administration may
prepare and implement an expenditure reduction plan without the approval of
the Joint Fiscal Committee, provided that any total reductions in
appropriations and transfers of funds are not greater than the reductions in the
official State revenue estimate. The Secretary may implement an expenditure
reduction plan under this subdivision if plan reductions to the total amount
appropriated in any section or subsection do not exceed five percent, the plan
is designed to minimize any negative effects on the delivery of services to the
public, and the plan does not have any unduly disproportionate effect on any
single function, program, service, benefit, or county. Plans not requiring the
approval of the Joint Fiscal Committee shall be filed with the Joint Fiscal
Office prior to implementation. If the Secretary’s plan consists of reductions
greater than five percent to the total amount appropriated in any section or
subsection, such plan shall only be implemented in the manner provided for in
subdivision (1) of this subsection.

(b)(1) The General Assembly may specifically unreserve and appropriate
the use of up to 50 percent of the amounts added in the prior fiscal year from
or transfer an amount not to exceed 10 percent of the General Fund Balance

Assembly that any General Fund Balance Reserve funds utilized in accordance
