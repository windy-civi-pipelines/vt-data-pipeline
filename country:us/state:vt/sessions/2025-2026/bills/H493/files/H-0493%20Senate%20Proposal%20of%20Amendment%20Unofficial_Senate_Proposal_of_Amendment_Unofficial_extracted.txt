9 § 704. INTERIM BUDGET AND APPROPRIATION ADJUSTMENTS
10 (a) The General Assembly recognizes that acts of appropriations and their
11 sources of funding reflect the priorities for expenditures of public funds
12 enacted by the General Assembly and that major reductions or transfers, when
13 required by reduced State revenues or other reasons, ought to be made
14 whenever possible by an act of the General Assembly reflecting its revisions of
15 those priorities. Nevertheless, the General Assembly also recognizes that
16 when it is not in session, it may be necessary to reduce authorized
17 appropriations and their sources of funding, and funds may need to be
18 transferred, to maintain a balanced State budget. Under these limited
19 circumstances, it is the intent of the General Assembly that appropriations may
20 be reduced and funds transferred when the General Assembly is not in session
21 pursuant to the provisions of this section.

1 (b)(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this section, in
2 each instance that the official State revenue estimate for the General Fund, the
3 Transportation Fund, or federal funds has been reduced by one percent or more
4 from the estimates determined and assumed for purposes of the current fiscal
5 year’s appropriations, the Secretary of Administration shall prepare an
6 expenditure reduction plan for consideration and approval by the Joint Fiscal
7 Committee pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, provided that any total
8 reductions in appropriations and transfers of funds are not greater than the
9 reductions in the official State revenue estimate.
10 (2) In each instance that the official State revenue estimate for the
11 General Fund, the Transportation Fund, or federal funds has been reduced by
12 less than one percent from the estimates determined and assumed for purposes
13 of the current fiscal year’s appropriations, the Secretary of Administration may
14 prepare and implement an expenditure reduction plan without the approval of
15 the Joint Fiscal Committee, provided that any total reductions in appropriations
16 and transfers of funds are not greater than the reductions in the official State
17 revenue estimate. The Secretary may implement an expenditure reduction plan
18 under this subdivision if plan reductions to the total amount appropriated in
19 any section or subsection do not exceed five percent, the plan is designed to
20 minimize any negative effects on the delivery of services to the public, and the
21 plan does not have any unduly disproportionate effect on any single function,

VT LEG #383234 v.1
SENATE PROPOSAL OF AMENDMENT H.493
2025 Page 167 of 284
1 (2) Community radio stations have consistently provided critical
2 information during emergencies, including Tropical Storm Irene, recent severe
3 flooding, and other natural disasters.
4 (3) These stations operate with small budgets, primarily relying on

8 Jericho, and Ludlow will expand coverage to nearly all Vermont counties,
9 increasing statewide accessibility to vital community radio services.

12 content that commercial and statewide media cannot replicate.

10 (a) The General Assembly recognizes that acts of appropriations and their
11 sources of funding reflect the priorities for expenditures of public funds
12 enacted by the General Assembly and that major reductions or transfers, when
13 required by reduced State revenues or other reasons, ought to be made
14 whenever possible by an act of the General Assembly reflecting its revisions of
15 those priorities. Nevertheless, the General Assembly also recognizes that
16 when it is not in session, it may be necessary to reduce authorized
17 appropriations and their sources of funding, and funds may need to be
18 transferred, to maintain a balanced State budget. Under these limited
19 circumstances, it is the intent of the General Assembly that appropriations may
20 be reduced and funds transferred when the General Assembly is not in session
21 pursuant to the provisions of this section.

4 from the estimates determined and assumed for purposes of the current fiscal
5 year’s appropriations, the Secretary of Administration shall prepare an
6 expenditure reduction plan for consideration and approval by the Joint Fiscal
7 Committee pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, provided that any total
8 reductions in appropriations and transfers of funds are not greater than the
9 reductions in the official State revenue estimate.

11 General Fund, the Transportation Fund, or federal funds has been reduced by
12 less than one percent from the estimates determined and assumed for purposes

14 prepare and implement an expenditure reduction plan without the approval of
15 the Joint Fiscal Committee, provided that any total reductions in appropriations
16 and transfers of funds are not greater than the reductions in the official State
17 revenue estimate. The Secretary may implement an expenditure reduction plan

19 any section or subsection do not exceed five percent, the plan is designed to
20 minimize any negative effects on the delivery of services to the public, and the
