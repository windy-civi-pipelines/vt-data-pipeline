No. 27 Page 137 of 277
2025
meetings of the General Assembly not budgeted for in prior, current, or future
appropriations acts. It is further the intent of the General Assembly that the
proposed fiscal year 2027 General Assembly budget exclude this $1,500,000
from any calculation of its base appropriation amount.
Sec. E.127 32 V.S.A. § 704 is amended to read:
§ 704. INTERIM BUDGET AND APPROPRIATION ADJUSTMENTS
(a) The General Assembly recognizes that acts of appropriations and their
sources of funding reflect the priorities for expenditures of public funds
enacted by the General Assembly and that major reductions or transfers, when
required by reduced State revenues or other reasons, ought to be made
whenever possible by an act of the General Assembly reflecting its revisions of
those priorities. Nevertheless, the General Assembly also recognizes that
when it is not in session, it may be necessary to reduce authorized
appropriations and their sources of funding, and funds may need to be
transferred, to maintain a balanced State budget. Under these limited
circumstances, it is the intent of the General Assembly that appropriations may
be reduced and funds transferred when the General Assembly is not in session
pursuant to the provisions of this section.
(b)(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this section, in
each instance that the official State revenue estimate for the General Fund, the
Transportation Fund, or federal funds has been reduced by one percent or more
from the estimates determined and assumed for purposes of the current fiscal
VT LEG #383907 v.1

No. 27 Page 138 of 277
2025
year’s appropriations, the Secretary of Administration shall prepare an
expenditure reduction plan for consideration and approval by the Joint Fiscal
Committee pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, provided that any total
reductions in appropriations and transfers of funds are not greater than the
reductions in the official State revenue estimate.
(2) In each instance that the official State revenue estimate for the
General Fund, the Transportation Fund, or federal funds has been reduced by
less than one percent from the estimates determined and assumed for purposes
of the current fiscal year’s appropriations, the Secretary of Administration may
prepare and implement an expenditure reduction plan without the approval of
the Joint Fiscal Committee, provided that any total reductions in appropriations
and transfers of funds are not greater than the reductions in the official State
revenue estimate. The Secretary may implement an expenditure reduction plan
under this subdivision if plan reductions to the total amount appropriated in
any section or subsection do not exceed five percent, the plan is designed to
minimize any negative effects on the delivery of services to the public, and the
plan does not have any unduly disproportionate effect on any single function,
program, service, benefit, or county. Plans not requiring the approval of the
Joint Fiscal Committee shall be filed with the Joint Fiscal Office prior to
implementation. If the Secretary’s plan consists of reductions greater than five
percent to the total amount appropriated in any section or subsection, such plan
VT LEG #383907 v.1

No. 27 Page 139 of 277
2025
shall only be implemented in the manner provided for in subdivision (1) of this
subsection.

legislative authorization.

(b)(1) The General Assembly may specifically unreserve and appropriate
the use of up to 50 percent of the amounts added in the prior fiscal year from or
transfer an amount not to exceed 10 percent of the General Fund Balance
Reserve to fund unforeseen or emergency needs. It is the intent of the General
Assembly that any General Fund Balance Reserve funds utilized in accordance
with this section be replenished.
(2) If the official State revenue estimates of the Emergency Board for
the General Fund, determined under section 305a of this title, have been
reduced by two percent or more from the estimates determined and assumed

in the General Fund Balance Reserve may be unreserved and appropriated or
transferred by the General Assembly to compensate for a reduction of
revenues.
(c) There is hereby created within the Transportation Fund a Transportation
Fund Balance Reserve. After satisfying the requirements of section 308a of

first meeting following September 1 of each year.
Sec. E.127.2 FEDERAL FUNDING; CALCULATION OF
APPROPRIATION REDUCTION; SECRETARY OF
ADMINISTRATION; JOINT FISCAL COMMITTEE
(a) As used in this section:
(1) “Unduplicated function total” means the individual function totals
set forth in this act excluding Global Commitment funds, Interdepartmental
Transfer funds, and Internal Service funds. For purposes of this section, the
determination of an unduplicated function total shall not include Education
Funds.
(2) “Governmental function unit” refers to the governmental function
areas set forth in Sec. A.108 of this act.
(b) In each instance that a reduction in federal revenues to the State results
in a decrease of the unduplicated function total for any governmental function
unit by:
(1) Less than 0.5 percent of the unduplicated function total or
$2,000,000, whichever threshold amount is greater, the Secretary of
Administration shall notify the Joint Fiscal Committee and may prepare and
implement a spending authority reduction plan without the approval of the
Joint Fiscal Committee, provided that any total reductions in appropriations
and transfers of funds are not greater than the reduction in the federal
VT LEG #383907 v.1

No. 27 Page 142 of 277
2025
revenues. If the Secretary’s plan consists of reductions greater than five
percent to the total amount appropriated in any section or subsection of any
appropriations act, such plan shall only be implemented in the manner
provided for in 32 V.S.A. § 704(b)(2).
(2) Greater than $2,000,000 and 0.5 percent of the unduplicated function
total for any governmental function unit, but less than 25 percent or
$50,000,000, whichever threshold amount is lower:
(A) the Secretary of Administration shall prepare a spending
authority reduction and transfer plan for consideration and approval by the
Joint Fiscal Committee pursuant to the same process established in 32 V.S.A.
§ 704(e), notwithstanding the reference to subdivision (b)(1) of this section,
provided that the total reductions to federal spending authority are not greater
than the reductions in federal revenues; and
(B) to maintain a balanced State budget, to minimize the impact to
Vermonters and to abide by the legislative intent set forth by the General
Assembly in this act, the Joint Fiscal Committee may make a recommendation
to the Emergency Board to:
(i) utilize the appropriation in Sec. B.1101(b)(2) of this act to
support impacted programs at not more than the current fiscal year funding
level until the General Assembly is in session;
(ii) revert any unexpended and unobligated funds; and
VT LEG #383907 v.1

No. 27 Page 143 of 277
2025
(iii) make such reductions or transfers in appropriations necessary
to support the priorities of the General Assembly.
(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, for the
purpose of calculating any appropriation reduction that triggers the actions set
forth in this section, the baseline federal funding amounts shall be the federal
funding set forth in this act. The Secretary of Administration shall monitor any
changes in federal funding as the difference between the baseline federal
funding amount for use in fiscal year 2026 and any updated State federal funds
revenue forecast adopted by the Emergency Board and shall calculate the
percent reduction of the unduplicated function totals for each governmental
function unit.

over 200,000 Vermonters, many in rural and underserved areas.
(2) Community radio stations have consistently provided critical
information during emergencies, including Tropical Storm Irene, recent severe
flooding, and other natural disasters.

Jericho, and Ludlow will expand coverage to nearly all Vermont counties,
increasing statewide accessibility to vital community radio services.
(5) Investment in these stations strengthens Vermont’s public safety
network and promotes civic engagement by providing local, hyper-focused
content that commercial and statewide media cannot replicate.
(b) Intent. The intent of this section is to ensure Vermont’s community
radio stations remain resilient and prepared to serve as lifelines during
emergencies while fostering local engagement and preserving Vermont’s
unique community fabric.
