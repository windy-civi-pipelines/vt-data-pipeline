15 Sec. E.127 32 V.S.A. § 704 is amended to read:
16 § 704. INTERIM BUDGET AND APPROPRIATION ADJUSTMENTS
17 (a) The General Assembly recognizes that acts of appropriations and their
18 sources of funding reflect the priorities for expenditures of public funds
19 enacted by the General Assembly and that major reductions or transfers, when
20 required by reduced State revenues or other reasons, ought to be made
21 whenever possible by an act of the General Assembly reflecting its revisions of

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.493
2025 Page 125 of 192
1 those priorities. Nevertheless, the General Assembly also recognizes that
2 when it is not in session, it may be necessary to reduce authorized
3 appropriations and their sources of funding, and funds may need to be
4 transferred, to maintain a balanced State budget. Under these limited
5 circumstances, it is the intent of the General Assembly that appropriations may
6 be reduced and funds transferred when the General Assembly is not in session
7 pursuant to the provisions of this section.
8 (b)(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this section, in
9 each instance that the official State revenue estimate for the General Fund, the
10 Transportation Fund, or federal funds has been reduced by one percent or more
11 from the estimates determined and assumed for purposes of the current fiscal
12 year’s appropriations, the Secretary of Administration shall prepare an
13 expenditure reduction plan for consideration and approval by the Joint Fiscal
14 Committee pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, provided that any total
15 reductions in appropriations and transfers of funds are not greater than the
16 reductions in the official State revenue estimate.
17 (2) In each instance that the official State revenue estimate for the
18 General Fund, the Transportation Fund, or federal funds has been reduced by
19 less than one percent from the estimates determined and assumed for purposes
20 of the current fiscal year’s appropriations, the Secretary of Administration may
21 prepare and implement an expenditure reduction plan without the approval of

BILLAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE H.493
2025 Page 126 of 192
1 the Joint Fiscal Committee, provided that any total reductions in
2 appropriations and transfers of funds are not greater than the reductions in the
3 official State revenue estimate. The Secretary may implement an expenditure
4 reduction plan under this subdivision if plan reductions to the total amount
5 appropriated in any section or subsection do not exceed five percent, the plan
6 is designed to minimize any negative effects on the delivery of services to the
7 public, and the plan does not have any unduly disproportionate effect on any
8 single function, program, service, benefit, or county. Plans not requiring the
9 approval of the Joint Fiscal Committee shall be filed with the Joint Fiscal
10 Office prior to implementation. If the Secretary’s plan consists of reductions
11 greater than five percent to the total amount appropriated in any section or
12 subsection, such plan shall only be implemented in the manner provided for in
13 subdivision (1) of this subsection.
14 (3) In each instance that a reduction of federal funds results in a one
15 percent or more reduction in the total federal funds anticipated in the most
16 recent fiscal year appropriations act:
17 (A) the Secretary of Administration shall prepare an expenditure
18 reduction and transfer plan for consideration and approval by the Joint Fiscal
19 Committee pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, provided that any total
20 reductions in appropriations and transfers of funds are not greater than the
21 reductions in federal funds; and

1 (B) to maintain a balanced State budget, minimize the impact to
2 Vermonters and to abide by the legislative intent set forth by the General
3 Assembly in the most recent appropriations act, the Joint Fiscal Committee

5 (i) pursuant to subdivision 308c(b)(3) of this title, utilize the
6 General Fund Balance Reserve to support impacted programs at not more than
7 the current fiscal year funding level until the General Assembly is in session;
8 (ii) revert any unexpended and unobligated funds or abolish any
9 spending authority, or both; and
10 (iii) make such reductions or transfers in appropriations necessary
11 to support the priorities of the General Assembly, and the recommended
12 reduction is limited to not more than 10 percent of any fund or 10 percent of
13 any appropriation.
14 (4) In each instance that a reduction of federal funds results in a five
15 percent or more reduction in the total funds available to support an
16 appropriation, the Secretary of Administration shall notify the Joint Fiscal
17 Committee.

7 established in 16 V.S.A. § 1949a.
8 (b)(1) The General Assembly may specifically unreserve and appropriate
9 the use of up to 50 percent of the amounts added in the prior fiscal year from
10 or transfer an amount not to exceed 10 percent of the General Fund Balance
11 Reserve to fund unforeseen or emergency needs. It is the intent of the General
12 Assembly that any General Fund Balance Reserve funds utilized in accordance
13 with this section be replenished.
14 (2) If the official State revenue estimates of the Emergency Board for
15 the General Fund, determined under section 305a of this title, have been
16 reduced by two percent or more from the estimates determined and assumed
17 for purposes of the general appropriations act or budget adjustment act, funds
18 in the General Fund Balance Reserve may be unreserved and appropriated or
19 transferred to compensate for a reduction of revenues.
20 (3) The Emergency Board, in response to a declared emergency
21 pursuant to 20 V.S.A. § 9 occurring while the General Assembly is not in

2025 Page 130 of 192

2 to subsection 704(b) of this title occurring while the General Assembly is not
3 in session, may unreserve and make available an amount not to exceed 10
4 percent of the General Fund Balance Reserve to replenish the spending
5 authority impacted by the declared emergency or reduction in funding in order
6 to maintain a balanced State budget, minimize the impact to Vermonters, and
7 to abide by the legislative intent set forth by the General Assembly in the most
8 recent fiscal year appropriations act. In no event shall the amount provided to
9 any agency or department under this subsection exceed the original amount
10 appropriated by the General Assembly.
11 (c) There is hereby created within the Transportation Fund a Transportation
12 Fund Balance Reserve. After satisfying the requirements of section 308a of
13 this title, and after other reserve requirements have been met, any remaining
14 unreserved and undesignated end of fiscal year Transportation Fund surplus
15 shall be reserved in the Transportation Fund Balance Reserve. Monies from
16 this Reserve shall be available for appropriation by the General Assembly.
17 (d) Determination of the amounts of the General Fund and Transportation
18 Fund Balance Reserves shall be made by the Commissioner of Finance and
19 Management and reported, along with the amounts appropriated pursuant to
