VT LEG #381546 v.1
AS PASSED BY HOUSE AND SENATE H.141
2025 Page 69 of 78

16 opportunities post-incarceration. The evaluation shall include consideration of
17 expanding technical training and certification opportunities that carry
18 recognized value in the labor market.
19 (3) An analysis of facility work programs to determine if each program
20 serves a sufficient portion of the incarcerated population to justify its
VT LEG #381546 v.1

1 administration. The analysis shall also consider whether participants gain
