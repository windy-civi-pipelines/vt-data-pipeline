3 Referred to Committee on
4 Date:
5 Subject: Education; State funding of public education; taxation and finance;
6 education property tax; education income tax; education finance
7 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to transition
8 from an education property tax to an education income tax in fiscal year 2027.
9 This bill would create an education tax that is based on the income of all
10 Vermont residents (both homeowners and renters) with a rate determined by
11 locally voted budgets. This bill would eliminate the homestead education
12 property tax and levy the nonhomestead education property tax on all property
13 except residential dwellings and the two-acre parcel surrounding the dwellings.
14 This bill would continue to provide the existing renter credit. This bill also
15 proposes to update the property tax credit income sensitivity measures to
16 provide relief to a broader class of Vermont taxpayers in fiscal year 2026.
17 An act relating to income-based education funding
18 It is hereby enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont:

1 credit for the claimant for homestead municipal property tax liabilities on a
2 monthly basis. The tax credit of a claimant who was assessed property tax by
3 a town that revised the dates of its fiscal year, however, is the excess of the
4 municipal property tax that was assessed in the last 12 months of the revised
5 fiscal year, over the adjusted property tax of the claimant for the revised fiscal
6 year, as determined under section 6066 of this title, related to a homestead
7 owned by the claimant.
8 (b) The Commissioner shall include in the total property tax credit amount
9 determined under subsection (a) of this section, for credit to the taxpayer for
10 homestead property tax liabilities, any income tax overpayment remaining
11 after allocation under section 3112 of this title and setoff under section 5934 of
12 this title, which the taxpayer has directed to be used for payment of property
13 taxes. [Repealed.]
14 (c) The Commissioner shall notify the municipality of any claim and
15 refund amounts unresolved by November 1 at the time of final resolution,
16 including adjudication, if any; provided, however, that towns will not be
17 notified of any additional credit amounts after November 1 of the claim year,
18 and such amounts shall be paid to the claimant by the Commissioner.
19 (d) [Repealed.]

2 subdivision 6066(a)(3) of this title, any additional credit amounts due the
3 homestead owner under section 6066 of this title, the amount of income tax
4 refund, if any, allocated to payment of homestead property tax liabilities, and
5 any late-claim reduction amount.
6 (f)(1) For taxpayers and amounts stated in the notice to towns on or before
7 July 1, municipalities shall create and send to taxpayers a homestead property
8 tax bill, instead of the bill required under subdivision 5402(b)(1) of this title,
9 providing the total amount allocated to payment of homestead education
10 property tax liabilities and notice of the balance due. Municipalities shall
11 apply the amount allocated under this chapter to current year property taxes in
12 equal amounts to each of the taxpayers’ property tax installments that include
13 education taxes. Notwithstanding section 4772 of this title, if a town issues a
14 corrected bill as a result of the notice sent by the Commissioner under
15 subsection (a) of this section, issuance of the corrected new bill does not
16 extend the time for payment of the original bill nor relieve the taxpayer of any
17 interest or penalties associated with the original bill. If the corrected bill is less
18 than the original bill, and there are also no unpaid current year taxes, interest,
19 or penalties, and no past year delinquent taxes or penalties and interest charges,
20 any overpayment shall be reflected on the corrected tax bill and refunded to the
21 taxpayer.

4 homestead property tax liabilities and notice of the balance due.
5 (3) The property tax credit amount determined for the taxpayer shall be
6 allocated first to current year property tax on the homestead parcel, next to
7 current-year homestead parcel penalties and interest, next to any prior year
8 homestead parcel penalties and interest, and last to any prior year property tax
9 on the homestead parcel. No credit shall be allocated to a property tax liability
10 for any year after the year for which the claim or refund allocation was filed.
11 No municipal tax-reduction incentive for early payment of taxes shall apply to
12 any amount allocated to the property tax bill under this chapter.
13 (4) If the property tax credit amount as described in subsection (e) of
14 this section exceeds the property tax, penalties, and interest due for the current
15 and all prior years, the municipality shall refund the excess to the taxpayer,
16 without interest, within 20 days of the first date upon which taxes become due
17 and payable or 20 days after notification of the credit amount by the
