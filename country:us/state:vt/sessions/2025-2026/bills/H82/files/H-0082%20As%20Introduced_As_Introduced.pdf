6 Subject: Health; health care reform; Green Mountain Care Board; Division of
7 Planning and Evaluation; hospitals; rate-setting
8 Statement of purpose of bill as introduced: This bill proposes to establish the
9 Division of Planning and Evaluation at the Green Mountain Care Board. The
10 Division would be responsible for preparing a report on the status of
11 Vermont’s health care system that enables the public to understand health care
12 system costs, performance, access, and quality. The Division would also be
13 responsible for preparing a five-year statewide strategic plan for improving
14 population health and for increasing Vermonters’ access to high-quality,
15 affordable health care, including ensuring that Vermonters living in rural
16 communities have appropriate access to primary care and hospital services.
17 The Division would establish total-cost-of-care spending growth targets and
18 recommend steps that the Green Mountain Care Board and others could take to
19 achieve the targets while improving access to and the quality of care. The
20 Division would also develop a proposal for achieving universal access to
VT LEG #379720 v.1

1 affordable, high-quality primary care and community-based mental health
2 services in Vermont.
3 The bill would direct the Green Mountain Care Board to implement, and to
4 identify any additional regulatory authority it would need to implement, the
5 statewide strategic plan and total-cost-of-care spending growth targets
6 established by the Division of Planning and Evaluation. The bill would also
7 direct the Board, in collaboration with hospitals and other interested
8 stakeholders, to develop a standardized process for financial reporting. The
9 bill would require the Board to create a process for promoting alignment
10 between the statewide strategic plan and hospitals’ strategic plans and budgets.
11 The bill would allow the Board to modify its timelines for hospital budget
12 reviews and hospital and insurer rate-setting in order to increase alignment and
13 efficiency. The bill would also direct the Board to evaluate alternative
14 approaches to regulating hospital budgets, including using reference-based
15 pricing and global hospital budgets, in order to align hospital spending with
16 both the statewide strategic plan and the total-cost-of-care spending growth
17 targets.
18 The bill would add several new positions and additional resources to the
19 Green Mountain Care Board for the Division of Planning and Evaluation,
20 provider rate setting and expanded budget review, and financial compliance
21 and auditing. The bill also proposes alternative funding sources for certain
VT LEG #379720 v.1
