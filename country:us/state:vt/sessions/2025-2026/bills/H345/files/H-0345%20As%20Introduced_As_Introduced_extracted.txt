12 Sec. 1. 10 V.S.A. § 6701 is added to read:
13 § 6701. GLITTER CONTAINING SYNTHETIC POLYMERS
14 (a) As used in this section:
15 (1) “Glitter” means an assortment of flat, small, reflective particles that
16 are precision cut and come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors used for
17 decoration or ornamentation.
18 (2) “Intentionally added synthetic polymer microparticles” mean
19 synthetic polymer microplastics that a manufacturer has added to a product to

1 confer a sought-after characteristic, in mixtures in a concentration equal to or
2 greater than one one-hundredth percent (0.01%) by weight.
3 (3)(A) “Synthetic polymer microparticles” mean polymers that are solid
4 and that fulfill both of the following conditions:
5 (i) the polymers are contained in particles and constitute at least
6 one percent by weight of those particles or build a continuous surface coating
7 on particles; and
8 (ii) at least one percent by weight of the particles fulfill either of
9 the following conditions:
10 (I) all dimensions of the particles are equal to or less than five
11 millimeters in size; or
12 (II) the length of the particles is equal to or less than 15
13 millimeters and each particle’s length is greater than three times the diameter.
14 (B) “Synthetic polymer microparticles” does not include polymers that
15 are the result of a polymerization process that has taken place in nature and not
16 as a result of human intervention, independently of the process through which
17 they have been extracted, which are not chemically modified substances.
18 (b)(1) Beginning on January 1, 2028, a person shall not sell, offer for sale,
19 or distribute into the commerce of the State any glitter containing intentionally
20 added synthetic polymer microparticles.
