Burlington, Minier of South Burlington, and Nugent of South Burlington
House concurrent resolution congratulating the South Burlington Chapter of Rotary International on 40
years of exemplary community service and professional camaraderie
Whereas, on February 23, 1905, Chicago attorney Paul Harris established the world’s first Rotary Club,
consisting of members from different professional and business backgrounds who gathered to “exchange ideas
and form meaningful, lifelong friendships,” and
Whereas, the organization quickly expanded around the globe, and within 16 years, there were Rotary Clubs
on sixcontinents, and
Whereas, a fundamental goal of all Rotary Clubs is to promote the Five Avenues of Service: Club Service,
Vocational Service, Community Service, International Service, and New Generation Service (empowering
youth), and
Whereas, Rotary International’s strong Vermont connection dates from 1923, and the South Burlington
Rotary Club, for which Rotary International issued a charter on October 28, 1985, has been a stellar
organizational contributor, and
Whereas, over the past four decades, the South Burlington Rotary Club has not only exemplified the highest
ideals of Rotary International, making significant financial donations to laudable local initiatives, but, equally,
has contributed to hands-on “people power” to support the success of community service projects that have
improved life in South Burlington, and
Whereas, among the community achievements in which the South Burlington Rotary Club has participated
are the completion of improvements to the bandshell at Veteran’s Memorial Park, the acquisition of an all-
electric delivery and pickup van for the South Burlington Food Shelf, and the installation of benches along
recreation paths, and they assist with school literacy projects, support Scouting programs, host and send
students who are studying on international and academic exchanges, and much more, and
Whereas, the South Burlington Rotary Club is proudly commemorating 40 years of selfless good deeds and
looks forward to active Rotary service for many years into the future, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the South Burlington Chapter of Rotary International on 40 years
of exemplary community service and professional camaraderie, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to the South Burlington
Rotary Club.
