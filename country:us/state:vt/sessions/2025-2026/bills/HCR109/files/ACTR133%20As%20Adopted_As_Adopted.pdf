Whereas, on February 23, 1905, Chicago attorney Paul Harris established the world’s
first Rotary Club, consisting of members from different professional and business
backgrounds who gathered to “exchange ideas and form meaningful, lifelong
friendships,” and
Whereas, the organization quickly expanded around the globe, and within 16 years,
there were Rotary Clubs on six continents, and
Whereas, a fundamental goal of all Rotary Clubs is to promote the Five Avenues of
Service: Club Service, Vocational Service, Community Service, International Service,
and New Generation Service (empowering youth), and
Whereas, Rotary International’s strong Vermont connection dates from 1923, and the
South Burlington Rotary Club, for which Rotary International issued a charter on October
28, 1985, has been a stellar organizational contributor, and
Whereas, over the past four decades, the South Burlington Rotary Club has not only
exemplified the highest ideals of Rotary International, making significant financial
donations to laudable local initiatives, but, equally, has contributed to hands-on “people
power” to support the success of community service projects that have improved life in
South Burlington, and
Whereas, among the community achievements in which the South Burlington Rotary
Club has participated are the completion of improvements to the bandshell at Veteran’s
Memorial Park, the acquisition of an all-electric delivery and pickup van for the South
Burlington Food Shelf, and the installation of benches along recreation paths, and they
assist with school literacy projects, support Scouting programs, host and send students
who are studying on international and academic exchanges, and much more, and
Whereas, the South Burlington Rotary Club is proudly commemorating 40 years of
selfless good deeds and looks forward to active Rotary service for many years into the
future, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the South Burlington Chapter of Rotary
International on 40 years of exemplary community service and professional camaraderie,
and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
the South Burlington Rotary Club.
