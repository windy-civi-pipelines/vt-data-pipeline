Whereas, Michelangelo Pistoletto is an artist whose societal involvement is an
essential aspect of his oeuvre, and
Whereas, he was born in 1933 in Biella, Italy; began figurative painting in the 1950s;
participated in the Biennale di San Marino in 1959; in 1960, staged his first solo
exhibition in Turin, Italy; and later in the decade, was honored with his first solo
American exhibition at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, and
Whereas, in 1962, Michelangelo Pistoletto began painting on mirrors to reflect the
realities of a painting’s location; subsequently, he assembled rags in combination with
casts of classical statuary to break down the hierarchies of art, and these forms of art
symbolized his desire to foster “a shared and responsible concept of humanity,” and
closely align him with Italy’s Arte Povera movement, and
Whereas, a highlight of Michelangelo Pistoletto’s distinguished career is his
establishment of the Fondazione Pistoletto Cittadellarte, a unique art community located
in the former Lanificio Trombetta wool mill in his hometown, and
Whereas, in 1994, he published the Progetto Arte Manifesto, which called for “artists
to take on the responsibility of establishing ties among all human activities,” and
Whereas, in 1998, the word Cittadellarte replaced the term Associazione in the
community’s name, symbolizing the facility’s role as an expression of the Progretto Arte
movement, and the Cittadellarte has evolved into a major center of artistic exploration
and innovation for both artists and the public, and
Whereas, in February 2025, Michelangelo Pistoletto was nominated for the Nobel
Peace Prize in recognition of his life’s commitment to peaceful collaboration through art,
now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly honors the Italian artist Michelangelo Pistoletto for his
extraordinary accomplishments, creativity, collaborative artistic leadership, and
nomination for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
