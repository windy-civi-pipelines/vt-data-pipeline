Whereas, the matchup in Castleton of the first-seeded Enosburg Falls High School
Hornets and the second-seeded Lyndon Institute Vikings for the 2024 Division II softball
honors was hardly surprising, but what transpired on the diamond was the Hornets’
amazing saga of perseverance, and
Whereas, after a scoreless first inning, in the top of the second, the Vikings powerfully
scored eight runs, potentially sealing the game’s outcome, and
Whereas, in their subsequent trips to the batter’s box, the talented Hornets proved
worthy of their top-tier ranking as they stopped additional Vikings from scoring and
tallied two runs in the bottom of the second, three in the third, one in the fourth, two in
the fifth, and two more in the sixth to cap an amazing comeback and secure a stunning
10–8 triumph, and
Whereas, the impressive Hornets were Camryn Benoit, Cassidy Blaney, Ava Burns,
Miley Decker, Annabelle Elwood, Leah Gervais, Erica Goodhue, Addyson Longe,
Makenna Lovelette, Kailie Morrill, Annalise Robtoy, Lillian Robtoy, Rory Schreindorfer,
Gretchen Stiebris, and Allie Wells, and
Whereas, Head Coach Randy Wells; assistant coaches Brad Lovelette, Shawna
Lovelette, and Ryan Wells; and student manager Natalie Lovelette were proud of their
team’s athletic accomplishment, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2024 Enosburg Falls High School
Hornets Division II championship softball team, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this resolution to
Enosburg Falls High School.
