Section 1:
State of Vermont
House of Representatives
Montpelier, Vermont
Concurrent House Resolution
H.C.R. 3
Gregoire of Fairfield, Laroche of Franklin, Oliver of Sheldon, and Walker of
Swanton
Offered by Senators Brock and Norris
House concurrent resolution congratulating the 2024 Enosburg Falls High
School Hornets Division II championship softball team
Whereas, the matchup in Castleton of the first-seeded Enosburg Falls High
School Hornets and the second-seeded Lyndon Institute Vikings for the 2024
Division II softball honors was hardly surprising, but what transpired on the
diamond was the Hornets’ amazing saga of perseverance, and
Whereas, after a scoreless first inning, in the top of the second, the Vikings
powerfully scored eight runs, potentially sealing the game’s outcome, and
Whereas, in their subsequent trips to the batter’s box, the talented Hornets
proved worthy of their top-tier ranking as they stopped additional Vikings
from scoring and tallied two runs in the bottom of the second, three in the
third, one in the fourth, two in the fifth, and two more in the sixth to cap an
amazing comeback and secure a stunning 10–8 triumph, and
Whereas, the impressive Hornets were Camryn Benoit, Cassidy Blaney, Ava
Burns, Miley Decker, Annabelle Elwood, Leah Gervais, Erica Goodhue,
Addyson Longe, Makenna Lovelette, Kailie Morrill, Annalise Robtoy, Lillian
Robtoy, Rory Schreindorfer, Gretchen Stiebris, and Allie Wells, and
Whereas, Head Coach Randy Wells; assistant coaches Brad Lovelette,
Shawna Lovelette, and Ryan Wells; and student manager Natalie Lovelette
were proud of their team’s athletic accomplishment, now therefore be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives:
That the General Assembly congratulates the 2024 Enosburg Falls High
School Hornets Division II championship softball team, and be it further
Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a copy of this
resolution to Enosburg Falls High School.
